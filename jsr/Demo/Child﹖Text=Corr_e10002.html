<h3>100. Willie o Winsbury</h3>

<p>P.398. This copy, <b>J</b>, which resemhles <b>D</b>, was
communicated by Mr. Macmath as derived, September 13, 1886, from
his aunt, Miss Jane Webster, who learned it above fifty years ago
at Airds of Kells, Kirkcudbrightshire, from the singing of Samuel
Galloway. "Barborough may be spelt Barburgh, Barbara, or even,
perhaps, Barbary."</p>
