<p>Given in Percy's Reliques, 1765, II, 145, "from an old printed
copy," with some changes by the editor, of which the more
important are in stanzas 2-4. <b>F</b>, "recovered from
recitation" by Motherwell, repeats Percy's changes in 2, 3,
10<sup>4</sup>, and there is reason to question whether this and
the other recited versions are anything more than traditional
variations of printed copies. The ballad seems first to have got
into print in the latter part of the seventeenth century, but was
no doubt circulating orally some time before that, for it is in
the truly popular tone. The fact that <i>two</i> friars hear the
confession would militate against a much earlier date. In B there
might appear to be some consciousness of this irregularity; for
the Queen sends for a single friar, and the King says he will be
"a prelate old" and sit in a dark corner; but none the less does
the King take an active part in the shrift.{[1}}</p>

<p>There is a Newcastle copy, "Printed and sold by Robert
Marchbank, in the Custom-house-Entry," among the Douce ballads in
the Bodleian Library, 3, fol. 80, and in the Roxburghe
collection, British Museum, III, 634. This is dated in the Museum
catalogue 1720?</p>

<p>Eleanor of Aquitaine was married to Henry II of England in
1152, a few weeks after her divorce from Louis VII of France, she
being then about thirty and Henry nineteen years of age. "It is
needless to observe," says Percy, "that the following ballad is
altogether fabulous; whatever gallantries Eleanor encouraged in
the time of her first husband, none are imputed to her in that of
her second."</p>

<p>In Peele's play of Edward I, 1593, the story of this ballad is
transferred from Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine to Edward
Longshanks and that model of women and wives, Eleanor of Castile,
together with other slanders which might less ridiculously have
been invented of Henry II's Eleanor.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d156_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Edward's brother Edmund
plays the part of the Earl Marshall. The Queen dies; the King
bewails his loss in terms of imbecile affection, and orders
crosses to be reared at all the stages of the funeral convoy.
Peele's Works, ed. Dyce, I, 184 ff.</p>

<p>There are several sets of tales in which a husband takes a
shrift-father's place and hears his wife's confession. 1. A
fabliau "Du chevalier qui fist sa fame confesse," Barbazan et
M&eacute;on, III, 229; Montaiglon, Recueil G&eacute;n&eacute;ral,
I, 178, No 16; Legrand, Fabliaux, etc., 1829, IV, 132, with
circumstances added by Legrand. 2. Les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles,
1432, No 78; Scala Celi, 1480, fol. 49;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d156_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Mensa Philosophica,
cited by Manni, Istoria del Decamerone, p. 476; Doni, Novelle,
Lucca, 1852, Nov. xiii; Malespini, Ducento Novelle, No 92,
Venice, 1609, I, 248; Kirchhof, Wendunmuth, No 245, Oesterley,
II, 535; La Fontaine, "Le Mari Confesseur," Contes, I, No 4. 3.
Boccaccio, vn, 5.</p>

<p>In 1, 2, the husband discovers himself after the confession;
in 3 he is recognized by the wife before she begins her shrift,
which she frames to suit her purposes. In all these, the wife, on
being reproached with the infidelity which she had revealed,
tells the husband that she knew all the while that he was the
confessor, and gives an ingenious turn to her apparently
compromising disclosures which satisfies him of her innocence.
All these tales have the cynical Oriental character, and, to a
healthy taste, are far surpassed by the innocuous humor of the
English ballad.</p>

<p>Oesterley, in his notes to Kirchhof, V, 103, cites a number of
German story-books in which the tale may, in some form, be found;
also Hans Sachs, 4, 3, 7b.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d156_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In Bandello, Parte Prima, No 9, a
husband, not disguising himself, prevails upon a priest to let
him overhear his wife's confession, and afterwards kills her.</p>

<p>Svend Grundtvig informed me that he had six copies of an
evidently recent (and very bad) translation of Percy's ballad,
taken down from recitation in different parts of Denmark. In one
of these Queen Eleanor is exchanged for a Queen of Norway.
Percy's ballad is also translated by Bodmer, II, 40; Ursinus, p.
59; Talvj, Charakteristik, p. 513; D&ouml;ring, p. 373; Knortz,
L. u. E. Alt-Englands, No 51.</p>

<p>The threat implied in <b>E</b> 3<sup>4</sup> has no motive;
and the phrase "haly spark" in 5<sup>4</sup> is an unadvised
anticipation.</p>
