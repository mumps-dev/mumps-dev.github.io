Roxburghe collection, I, 502; Ballad Society, III, 200.</p>

<p>'The Daemon Lover' was first published in Scott's Minstrelsy,
5th edition, 1812 (<b>F</b>). William Laidlaw, who furnished the
copy, inserted four stanzas of his own (6, 12, 17, 18, here
omitted).<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d243_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Motherwell, in 1827, had not been able to get more
than nine stanzas (<b>G</b>), but afterwards secured a version of
twice as many (<b>B</b>). Kinloch says of <b>D</b>, "My reciter,
and others to whom I applied, assured me that they had never
heard any more of it than what is given here." Buchan, I, 313,
referring to Motherwell's fragment (<b>G</b>), is "happy to say
... there is still a perfect copy of this curious and scarce
legend in existence, which is now for the first time given to the
public" (<b>C</b>).</p>

<p>An Americanized version of this ballad was printed not very
long ago at Philadelphia, under the title of 'The
House-Carpenter.' I have been able to secure only two stanzas,
which were cited in Graham's Illustrated Magazine, September,
1858:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'I might have married the king's daughter dear;'<br/>
'You might have married her,' cried she,<br/>
'For I am married to a house-carpenter,<br/>
And a fine young man is he.'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'Oh dry up your tears, my own true love,<br/>
And cease your weeping,' cried he,<br/>
'For soon you'll see your own happy home,<br/>
On the banks of old Tennessee.'</td></tr>

</table>

<p><b>B</b>-<b>H</b> have for their basis the broadside <b>A</b>:
the substance of the story is repeated, with traditional
modifications. Two or three stanzas of <b>A</b> are of the
popular description, but it does not seem necessary to posit a
tradition behind <b>A</b>. The correspondences of the several
versions are as follows:</p>

<p>It will be observed that each of the versions
<b>B</b>-<b>F</b> adds something which is taken up by a successor
or successors. The arrangement of <b>E</b> and <b>F</b>, of
<b>E</b> especially, is objectionable.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Jane Reynolds and James Harris, a seaman, had
exchanged vows of marriage. The young man was pressed as a
sailor, and after three years was reported as dead; the young
woman married a ship-carpenter, and they lived together happily
for four years, and had children. One night when the carpenter
was absent from home, a spirit rapped at the window and announced
himself as James Harris, come after an absence of seven
years<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d243_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> to claim the woman for his wife. She explained the
state of things, but upon obtaining assurance that her long-lost
lover had the means to support her seven ships upon the sea
consented to go with him, for he was really much like unto a man.
'The woman-kind' was seen no more after that; the carpenter
hanged himself.</p>

<p>The carpenter is preserved in B-E, and even his name in
<b>C</b>. He swoons in <b>B</b>, and runs distracted in <b>C</b>,
when he learns what has become of his wife; the other versions
take no notice of him after the elopement. <b>B</b>-<b>F</b> all
begin with the return of the long-absent lover. The ship (as it
is to have in <b>A</b> 26) has silken sails and gold masts, or
the like, <b>C</b> 10, <b>F</b> 9<sup>3,4</sup> (<i>cf.</i>
<b>B</b> 8, <b>G</b> 1); but there are no visible mariners,
<b>F</b> 9<sup>1,2</sup>, <b>G</b> 4<sup>3,4</sup>. The pair have
been only a short time afloat when the woman begins to weep for
son, husband, or both, <b>B</b> 9, 10, <b>C</b> 14, <b>D</b> 5,
<b>E</b> 12, 13, <b>G</b> 5. The seaman (as it will be convenient
to call him) tells her to hold her tongue, he will show her how
the lilies grow on the banks of Italy, <b>C</b> 16, <b>D</b> 6
(<i>cf.</i> <b>E</b> 16, 17), <b>F</b> 12, and, in a different
connection, <b>G</b> 6. The seaman's countenance grows grim, and
the sea gurly, <b>D</b> 7, <b>B</b> 10, <b>F</b> 10, <b>G</b> 8.
He will let her see the fishes swim, where the lilies grow, in
the bottom of the sea, <b>C</b> 21, <b>D</b> 8 (<i>cf.</i>
<b>E</b> 16, 17). She discerns that the seaman has a cloven foot,
<b>B</b> 11, <b>F</b> 11, <b>G</b> 7. She asks, What is yon
bright hill? It is the hill of heaven, where she will never be.
What is yon dark hill? It is the hill of hell, where they two
shall be: <b>E</b> 14, 15, <b>F</b> 13, 14. The seaman reaches
his hand to the topmast, strikes the sails, and the ship drowns,
<b>C</b> 22; takes the woman up to the topmast and sinks the ship
in a flash of fire, <b>E</b> 18; strikes the topmast with his
hand, the foremast with his knee, and sinks the ship, <b>F</b>
15. In <b>E</b> 9 he throws the woman into the main, and
five-and-twenty hundred ships are wrecked; in <b>G</b> 9 the
little ship runs round about and never is seen more.</p>

<p>In <b>A</b> the revenant is characterized as a spirit; in
<b>B</b>, which is even tamer than <b>A</b>, he is called the
mariner, and is drowned with the woman; in <b>C</b> he expressly
says to the woman, I brought you away to punish you for breaking
your vows to me. This explicitness may be prosaic, but it seems
to me regrettable that the conception was not maintained. To
explain the eery personality and proceedings of the ship-master,
<b>E</b>-<b>G</b>, with a sort of vulgar rationalism, turn him
into the devil, and as he is still represented in <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b> (<b>G</b> being defective at the beginning) as returning
to seek the fulfilment of old vows, he there figures as a "daemon
lover." <b>D</b> (probably by the fortunate accident of being a
fragment) leaves us to put our own construction upon the weird
seaman; and, though it retains the homely ship-carpenter, is on
the whole the most satisfactory of all the versions.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d243_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Scott's ballad is translated by Talvj, Versuch, etc., p. 558; by Gerhard, p. 84; and by 
Rosa Warrens, Schottische Volkslieder, No 14, 
p. 61 (after Aytoun, who repeats Scott, omitting one of Laidlaw's stanzas). Knortz, Lieder und Romanzen Alt-Englands, p. 192, 
translates Allingham's ballad.</p>
