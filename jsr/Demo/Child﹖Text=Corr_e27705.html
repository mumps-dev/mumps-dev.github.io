<h3>277. The Wife Wrapt in Wether's Skin</h3>


<p>P. 104. From the recitation of Miss Lydia R. Nichols, Salem,
Massachusetts, as heard in the early years of this century. Sung
by a New England country fellow on ship-board: Journal of
American Folk-Lore, VII, 253 ff., 1894.</p>

<p>As to "drew her table," 13, the following information is
given: "I have often heard a mother tell her daughter to 'draw
the table.' Forty years ago it was not uncommon to see in
farmhouses a large round table, the body of which was made to
serve as an armchair. When the table was not in use the top was
tipped back against the wall. Under the chair-seat was a drawer
in which the table linen was kept. When meal-time came the table
was drawn away from the wall, the top brought down on the arms of
the chair, and the cloth, which had been fished out of the
drawer, spread over it."</p>
