<p><b>A</b>. 'Sir Fenwick' steals the king's jewels and lays the
blame on James Hatley, who is condemned to death. The king's
daughter steals the prison-keys from, under her father's head and
pays a visit to Hatley, who assures her of his innocence, and
tells her that Fenwick is the man. [<b>b</b>, the king is angry,
and says that for stealing his jewels Hatley shall die 'over the
barriers:' so <b>B</b>.] The princess goes to her father and begs
the life of Hatley, and her boon is granted without demur. She
asks one thing more, that Fenwick and Hatley may try their verity
at the sword, and this is unhesitatingly conceded. Hatley is but
fifteen years old (he is seventeen <b>b</b>, eighteen <b>c</b>,
fif- teen again <b>C</b>), and Fenwick is thirty-three;
nevertheless, Fenwick gets three wounds. An English lord
intermits: he would have given all his estates rather than Hatley
should escape; a Scots lord replies that he would have fought to
the knees in blood before Hatley should have been hanged. (The
Scots lord is wanting in <b>b</b>; the passage is likely to be
borrowed from '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_209.html">Geordie</a>,' No 209.) The king's eldest son asks
Hatley to dine, and makes him his captain by land and sea;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d244_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
the king's daughter invites him to dine, and announces that she
has made a vow to marry no other man.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. Hatley, accused of stealing the king's jewels, goes
to the little prince and asks what he will do for his page; the
prince goes to his father and asks what he will do for the page.
The king says that Hatley has stolen his jewels, so a Norland
lord has informed him, and Hatley must die 'over the barriers.'
The prince offers to fight any man who lays the blame on Hatley.
Fenwick maintains that Hatley is the thief. The prince gives
Fenwick two or three mortal wounds; Fenwick hands him the key of
his coffer, and in the coffer the jewels will be found. The king
invests Hatley with Fenwick's lands.</p>

<p><b>C</b>. A false knight, Phenix, steals the queen's jewels,
and leaves the blame on Jamie O'Lee. The king sends for his son
and tells him that Jamie has been accused of the theft by an
English lord, and shall be banished from Scotland. The prince
demands a man to fight with Jamie on this charge, and false
Phenix offers himself. The prince at first objects, for Jamie is
but fifteen years old, whereas Phenix is of course thirty-three;
however, he tells Jamie that he must fight or be banished from
England (8, compare 14). Jamie protests his innocence. He fights
with Phenix and receives the first wound, then runs Phenix
through the body; Phenix owns his guilt. The king tells Jamie to
come home with him; every knight in the court shall be at his
command. The queen bids Jamie come home with her; he shall have a
new livery every month. The prince invites Jamie to come home
with him; all his lands in Scotland shall be at Jamie's command.
Jamie thanks king, queen, and nobility; he has been a prince's
page all his life, and a prince's page he still will be.</p>
