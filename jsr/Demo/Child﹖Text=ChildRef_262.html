<h3>Lord Livingston</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Lord Livingston,' Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 39.
<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d26201.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>As far as can be made out, Livingston and Seaton engage
themselves to play against one another at some game, the victor
expecting to stand the better in the eyes of a lady. They then
proceed to Edinburgh castle, where a lady, whose 'gowns seem like
green,' marshals the company in pairs, and chooses Livingston for
her own partner. This preference enrages Seaton, who challenges
Livingston to fight with him the next day. Up to this point the
pairing may have been for a dance, or what not, but now we are
told that Livingston and the fair dame are laid in the same bed,
and further on that they were wedded that same night. In the
morning Livingston arms himself for his fight; he declines to let
his lady dress herself in man's clothes and fight in his stead.
On his way 'to plain fields' a witch warns him that she has had
the dream which Sweet William dreams in No 74, and others
elsewhere. Livingston is 'slain,' but for all that stands
presently bleeding by his lady's knee: see No 73, <b>B</b> 34,
<b>D</b> 17. She begs him to hold out but half an hour, and every
leech in Edinburgh shall come to him: see No 88, <b>A</b> 12,
etc. He orders his lands to be dealt to the auld that may not,
the young that cannot, etc.: see No 92, <b>A</b> 10, <b>B</b> 15.
The lady declares that it was known from her birth that she was
to marry a knight and lose him the next day. She will now do for
his sake what other ladies would not be equal to (and which
nevertheless many other ballad-ladies have undertaken, as in No
69 and elsewhere). When seven years are near an end her heart
breaks.</p>

<p>This ballad, or something like it, was known at the end of the
last century. The story has a faint resemblance to that of
'Armstrong and Musgrave,' a broadside printed in the last quarter
of the seventeenth century: Crawford Ballads, No 123, Old
Ballads, 1723, I, 175; Evans, Old Ballads, 1777, II, 70.
Pinkerton acknowledges that he composed the 'Lord Livingston' of
his Tragic Ballads, 1781, p. 69, but he says that he had "small
lines from tradition." (Ancient Scotish Poems, 1786, I, cxxxi.)
Pinkerton's ballad is the one which Buchan refers to, II, 308. It
is translated by Grundtvig, Engelske og skotske Folkeviser, p.
139, No 21.</p>
