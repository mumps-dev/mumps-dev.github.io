<a name="A"></a>
<p><b>4.1 argument</b> (of a command): M[UMPS]
command words are verbs. Their arguments are
the objects on which they act.</p>
<p><b>4.2 array:</b> M[UMPS] arrays, unlike those of most
other computer languages, are trees of unlimited
depth and breadth. Every node may optionally
contain a value and may also have zero or more
descendant nodes. The name of a subscripted
variable refers to the root, and the <i>n</i>th subscript
refers to a node on the nth level. Arrays vary in
size as their nodes are set and killed. See also
<i>scalar</i>, <i>subscript</i>.</p>
<p><b>4.3 atom:</b> a singular, most-basic element of a
construction. For example, some atoms in an
expression are names of variables and functions,
numbers, and string literals.</p>
<a name="B"></a>
<p><b>4.4 block:</b> one or more lines of code within a
routine that execute in line as a unit. The
argumentless <a href="AnnoStd%EF%B9%96Frame=Main&amp;Edition=MDC&amp;Page=a108026.html#Def_0002">Do</a> command introduces a block,
and each of its lines begins with one or more
periods. Blocks may be nested. See also <i>level</i>.</p>
<a name="C"></a>
<p><b>4.5 call by name:</b> a calling program names an
actual parameter and passes its value to an
object's service. Limited to a single value, that is,
the value of a scalar variable or of one node in an
array. See also <i>call by reference</i>, <i>call by value</i>.</p>
<p><b>4.6 call by reference:</b> a calling program passes
to a subroutine or function a reference to its
actual parameter. If the called subroutine,
function, or object's service changes the value of
its formal parameter, the change affects the
actual parameter as well. Limited to
unsubscripted names of local variables, either
scalar or array. See also <i>call by name</i>, <i>call by
value</i>.</p>
<p><b>4.7 call by value:</b> a calling program passes the
value of its actual parameter to a subroutine,
function, or object's service. Limited to a single
value, that is, the value of a scalar variable or of
one node in an array. See also <i>call by name</i>, <i>call
by reference</i>.</p>
<p><b>4.8 call:</b> a procedural process of transferring
execution control to a <b>callee</b> by a <b>caller</b>.</p>
<p><b>4.9 callee:</b> the recipient of a <b>call</b>.</p>
<p><b>4.10 caller:</b> the originator of a <b>call</b>.</p>
<p><b>4.11 character:</b> (1) a member of a set of
elements used for the organization, control, or
representation of data. (2) a character is a simple
or composite graphic symbol belonging to a
conventional set of symbols. There are alphabetic
characters, numerical characters (arabic and
roman), diacritic characters (for example 
^ &#176; &#768;&nbsp; &#769;&nbsp;),
punctuation characters (for example . , ; : ! ?),
and specific other characters (for example ยง $ %
&amp; { #). The following synonyms should be
avoided: graphic symbol, phonetic symbol, sign,
mark, note, cipher, whether or not these are used
in conjunction with terms like phonetic and
graphic..</p>
<p><b>4.12 combining character:</b> a member of an
identified subset of the coded character set of
ISO/IEC 10646 intended for combination with the
preceding non-combining graphic character, or
with a sequence of combining characters
preceded by a non-combining character (see also
<i>composite sequence</i>). NOTE - ISO/IEC 10646
specifies several subset collections which include
combining characters.</p>
<p><b>4.13 command:</b> a command word (a verb), an
optional conditional expression, and zero or more
arguments. Commands initiate all actions in
M[UMPS].</p>
<p><b>4.14 composite sequence:</b> a sequence of
graphic characters consisting of a non-combining
character followed by one or more combining
characters (see also <i>combining characters</i>).
NOTES - 1) A graphic symbol for a composite
sequence generally consists of the combination
of the graphic symbols of each character in the
sequence. 2) A composite sequence is not a
character and therefore is not a member of the
repertoire any character set.</p>
<p><b>4.15 computationally equivalent:</b> the result of
a procedure is the same as if the code provided
were executed by a M[UMPS] program without
error. However, there is no implication that
executing the code provided is the method by
which the result is achieved.</p>
<p><b>4.16 concatenation:</b> the act or result of joining
two strings together to make one string.</p>
<p><b>4.17 conditional expression:</b> guards a
command (sometimes an argument of a
command). Only if the expression's value is true
does the command execute (or the argument).
See also <i>truthvalue</i>.</p>
<p><b>4.18 contains:</b> a relational operator that tests
whether one string is a substring of another.</p>
<a name="D"></a>
<p><b>4.19 data-cell:</b> in the formal model of M[UMPS]
execution. It contains the value and subscripts (if
any) of a variable, but not the name of the
variable. Any number of variable names may point
to a data-cell due to parameters passed by
reference. See also <i>name-table</i>, <i>value-table</i>.</p>
<p><b>4.20 default property:</b> the default state of an
object; a property to which an OREF evaluates if
used in a property reference that doesn't name a
specific property. See also <i>default state</i>, <i>OREF</i>,
<i>property</i>.</p>
<p><b>4.21 default state:</b> the state that is assumed
when no state has been explicitly specified.</p>
<p><b>4.22 descriptor:</b> uniquely defines an element. It
comprises various characteristics of the element
that distinguish the element from all other similar
elements.</p>
<p><b>4.23 device-dependent:</b> that which depends on
the device in question.</p>
<p><b>4.24 diacritic:</b> character which is not a letter of
the latin alphabet and which is placed over,
under, or through a <i>letter</i> or combination of <i>letters</i>
indicating a semantic or phonetic value different
from that given the unmarked or otherwise
marked <i>letter</i>. A <i>letter</i> with a diacritic is a
composite character. NOTE - The points of
german "Umlaut"-character should be regarded
as diacritic. [also called a <i>diacritical mark</i>]</p>
<p><b>4.25 diacritic mark:</b> an attribute of a character,
written either above or below that character,
applied to denote a phonetically or linguistically
different letter.</p>
<p><b>4.26 digit:</b> a graphic character used to represent
the numeric value, or part thereof, of a number.
Examples: decimal digits, hexadecimal digits.</p>
<a name="E"></a>
<p><b>4.27 empty:</b> an entity that contains nothing. For
example, an empty string contains no
characters; it exists but has zero length. See
also <i>null string</i>, <i>NULL character</i>.</p>
<p><b>4.28 environment:</b> a set of distinct names. For
example, in one global variable environment all
global variables have distinct names. Similar to a
directory in many operating systems.</p>
<p><b>4.29 evaluate:</b> to derive a value.</p>
<p><b>4.30 execute:</b> to perform the operations
specified by the commands of the language.</p>

two or more letters. There are ligatures that are
conventionalized units of national variants of
alphabets, and ligatures that are caused by the
font used in a document. Maybe the first ones
should be named <i>ligature characters</i>, the last
ones <i>ligature font elements</i>. [Language
dependent. Only <i>ligature characters</i> are taken
into consideration] (2) two or more letters written

operand by another. There are many
interpretations of how this operation is performed
in the general computing field. M[UMPS]
explicitly defines the result of this computation.</p>
<table>
<tr><td bgcolor="#ff0000"><b>Proposed new definition</b>:<br/>
<b>4.56 modulo:</b> an arithmetic operator that
produces the result of a mapping of one operand onto a
subspace defined by the other operand.
For a mathematical definition see D.E. Knuth, <i>The
Art of Computer Programming, Volume I, Fundamental Algorithms</i>
(or any other book about Abelian Group Theory).<br/>
<b>Note</b>: Modulo is not the same as Remainder.
M[UMPS] does not have a Remainder operator.</td></tr>
</table>

arrays to indicate that the array can have more
than one dimension.</p>
<p><b>4.58 MVAL:</b> the type of any data value that may

<p><b>4.66 ordering:</b> bringing strings of characters into
a well-defined sequence using a string
comparison specification.</p>
<p><b>4.67 OREF:</b> an object reference. A value of data
type OREF is a reference to an object that
uniquely identifies that object. OREFs have no
literal representation. Under most circumstances,
values of data type OREF are coerced into values
of type MVAL based on the value of the default
property of the object identified by the value of
data type OREF. See also <i>default property</i>,

compare the values of their operands.</p>
<a name="S"></a>
<p><b>4.82 scalar:</b> single-valued, without descendants.
See also <i>array</i>.</p>
<p><b>4.83 scope</b> (of a command): the range of other
commands affected by the command, as in loop
control, block structure, and conditional
execution.</p>
<p><b>4.84 scope</b> (of a local variable): the range of
commands for which the variable is visible, from
its creation to its deletion, or from its appearance
in a <a href="AnnoStd%EF%B9%96Frame=Main&amp;Edition=MDC&amp;Page=a108042.html#Def_0002">New</a> command to the end of the subroutine,
function, or block. Scope is not textual, but
dynamic, controlled by the flow of execution.</p>
