<p>The murder of the "Bonny Earl of Murray" was the occasion of
serious commotions in the North Highlands. Towards the end of the
year 1592, the Macintoshes of the Clan Chattan, who of all the
faction of Murray "most eagerly endeavored to revenge his death,"
invaded the estates of the Earl of Huntly, and killed four
gentlemen of the surname of Gordon. Huntly retaliated, "and rade
into Pettie (which was then in the possession of the Clan
Chattan), where he wasted and spoiled all the Clan Chattan's
lands, and killed divers of them. But as the Earl of Huntly had
returned home from Pettie, he was advertised that William
Macintosh with eight hundred of Clan Chattan were spoiling his
lands of Cabrach: whereupon Huntly and his uncle Sir Patrick
Gordon of Auchindown, with some few horsemen, made speed towards
the enemy, desiring the rest of his company to follow him with
all possible diligence, knowing that if once he were within sight
of them they would desist from spoiling the country. Huntly
overtook the Clan Chattan before they left the bounds of Cabrach,
upon the head of a hill called Stapliegate, where, without
staying for the rest of his men, he invaded them with these few
he then had. After a sharp conflict he overthrew them, chased
them, killed sixty of their ablest men, and hurt William
Macintosh with divers others of his company."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d183_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Two William Macintoshes are confounded in the ballad. The
burning of Auchindown is attributed, rightly or wrongly, to an
earlier William, captain of the clan, who, in August, 1550, was
formally convicted of conspiracy against the life of the Earl of
Huntly, then lieutenant in the north, sentenced to lose his life
and lands, and, despite a pledge to the contrary, executed
shortly after by the Countess of Huntly.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d183_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Auchindown castle is on the banks of the Fiddich, <b>B</b> 1.
By Cairn Groom, <b>A</b> 4, is meant, I suppose, the noted
Cairngorm mountain, at the southern extremity of Banffshire.</p>
