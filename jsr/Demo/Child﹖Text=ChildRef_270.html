<h3>The Earl of Mar's Daughter</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'The Earl of Mar's Daughter,' Buchan's Ballads of the North
of Scotland, I, 49; Motherwell's Manuscript p. 565. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d27001.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>The Earl of Mar's daughter spies a dove on a tower, and
promises him a golden cage if he will come to her. The dove
lights on her head, and she takes him into her bower. When night
comes, she sees a youth standing by her side. The youth explains
that his mother, a queen versed in magic, had transformed him
into a dove that he might charm maids. He is a dove by day, a man
at night, and will live and die with her. In the course of seven
years seven sons are born, all of whom are successively committed
to the care of the queen their grandmother. After the
twenty-third year a lord comes to court the lady. She refuses
him: she will live alone with her bird. Her father swears that he
will kill this bird, and Cow-me-doo prudently takes refuge with
his mother, who welcomes home her 'young son Florentine,' and
calls for dancers and minstrels. Cow-me-doo Florentine will have
none of that; the situation is too serious. The morrow the mother
of his seven sons is to be wedded; instead of merry-making, he
desires to have twenty stout men turned into storks, his seven
sons into swans, and himself into a goshawk. This feat is beyond
his mother's (quite limited) magic, but it is done by an old
woman who has more skill. The birds fly to Earl Mar's castle,
where the wedding is going on. The storks seize some of the noble
guests, the swans bind the bride's best man to a tree, and in a
twinkling the bride and her maidens are carried off by the birds.
The Earl of Mar reconciles himself with his daughter.</p>

<p>There is a Scandinavian ballad which Grundtvig has treated as
identical with this, but the two have little in common beyond the
assumption of the bird-shape by the lover. They are, perhaps, on
a par for barrenness and folly, but the former may claim some age
and vogue, the Scottish ballad neither.</p>

<p><b>Danish</b>. 'Ridderen i Fugleham,' Grundtvig, II, 226, No 68,
<b>A</b>-<b>C</b> (<b>C</b> is translated by Prior, III, 206);
'Herr Jon som Fugl,' Kristensen, I, 161, No 59, X, 23, No 11,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. In Grundtvig's <b>A</b> (Manuscript of the
sixteenth century), the son of the king of England wooes a maid,
sending her rich presents. Her mother says he shall never have
her daughter, and this message his envoys take back to him. He is
angry, and has a bird's coat forged for him out of nine gold
rings (but his behavior thereafter is altogether birdlike). He
sits on the ridgepole of the maid's bower and sings. The maid
exclaims, Christ grant thou wert mine! thou shouldst drink naught
but wine, and sleep in my arms. I would send thee to England, as
a gift to my love. She sits down on the ground; the bird flies
into her bosom. She takes the bird into her bower; he throws off
his bird-coat, and is recognized. The maid begs him to do her no
shame. 'Not if you will go to England with me,' he answers, takes
her up, and wings his way thither. There he marries her, and
gives her a crown and a queen's name.</p>

<p>In Grundtvig <b>B</b>, the bird is a falcon. The maid will
have no man that cannot fly. Master Hillebrand, son of the king
of England, learns this fact, and has a bird's coat made for him,
enters the room where man had never been before, sleeps under
white linen, and in the morning is a knight so braw. (Here the
story ends.)</p>

<p>In <b>C</b>, the maid will have no man that cannot fly, and
Master Hillebrand orders a bird's coat to be made for him (what
could be more mechanical!), flies into the maid's bower, and
passes the night on the pole on which she hangs her clothes. In
the morning he begins to sing, flies to the bed, and plays with
the maid's hair. If you could shed your feathers, says the maid,
I would have no other man. Keep your word, says the bird; give me
your hand, and take my claw. She passes her word; he throws off
his feathers, and stands before her a handsome man. By day, says
the maid, he is to fly with the birds, by night to sleep in her
bed. He perches so long on the clothes-pole that Ingerlille has a
girl and a boy. When her father asks who is their father, she
tells him the positive truth; she found them in a wood. When the
bird comes back at night, she says that he must speak to her
father; further concealment is impossible. Master Hillebrand asks
the father to give him his daughter. The father is surprised that
he should want a maid that has been beguiled; but if he will
marry her she shall have a large dowry. The knight wants nothing
but her.</p>

<p>Kristensen's copies do not differ materially. 11 A in his
tenth volume (a very brief ballad) drops or lacks the manufacture
of the bird-coat. Grundtvig's <b>D</b>-<b>G</b> drop the bird
quite.</p>

<p>The ballad occurs in Swedish, but in the form of a mere
abstract; in Arwidsson, II, 188, No 112, Manuscript of the
sixteenth century. A maid will have no man but one that can fly.
A swain has wings made from five gold rings; he flies over the
rose-wood, over the sea, sits on a lily-spray and sings, flies
till he sleeps in the maid's bosom.</p>

<p>A F&auml;r&ouml;e copy is noted by Grundtvig as in the
possession of Hammershaimb, resembling his <b>B</b>, but about
twice as long.</p>

<p>The lover in bird-shape is a very familiar trait in fiction,
particularly in popular tales.</p>

<p>In Marie de France's Lai d'Yonec, a lover comes in at his
mistress's window in the form of a hawk; in 'Der Jungherr und der
treue Heinrich,' von der Hagen, Gesammtabenteuer, No 64, III,
197, Manuscript of 1444, as a bird (by virtue of a stone of which
he has possessed himself).<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d270_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In Hahn, No 102, II, 130
