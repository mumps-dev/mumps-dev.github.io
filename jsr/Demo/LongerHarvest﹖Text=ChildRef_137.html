<h3>Robin Hood and the Pedlars</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Robinhood and the Peddlers,' the fourth ballad in a 
Manuscript formerly in the possession of J. Payne Collier, 
now in the British Museum; previously printed in 
Gutch's Robin Hood, II, 351. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d13701.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>
 
<p>The manuscript in which this ballad occurs contains a variety
of matters, and, as the best authority<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d137_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> has declared, may in
part have been written as early as 1650, but all the ballads are
in a nineteenth-century hand, and some of them are maintained to
be forgeries. I see no sufficient reason for regarding this
particular piece as spurious, and therefore, though I should be
glad to be rid of it, accept it for the present as perhaps a copy
of a broadside, or a copy of a copy.</p>

<p>The story resembles that of Robin Hood's Delight, pedlars
taking the place of keepers; but Robin is reduced to an ignominy
paralleled only in the second ballad of Robin Hood and the
Beggar. Robin Hood, accompanied by Scarlet and John, bids three
pedlars stand. They pay no heed, and he sends an arrow through
the pack of one of them. Hereupon they throw down their packs and
wait for their assailants to come up. Robin's bow is broken by a
blow from a staff of one of the pedlars. Robin calls a truce
until he and his men can get staves. There is then an equal
fight, the end of which is that Robin Hood is knocked senseless
and left in a swoon, tended by Scarlet and John. But before the
pedlars set forward, Kit o Thirsks, the best man of the three,
and the one who has fought with Robin, administers a balsam to
his fallen foe, which he says will heal his hurts, but which
operates unpleasantly.</p>

<p>Thirsk is about twenty miles from York, in the North
Riding.</p>
