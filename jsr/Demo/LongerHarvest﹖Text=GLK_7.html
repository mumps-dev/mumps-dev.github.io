<h3>7. Earl Brand</h3>

<p>'Earl Brand' has preserved most of the incidents of a very
ancient story with a faithfulness unequalled by any ballad that
has been recovered from English oral tradition. It has, however,
all but lost a circumstance that forms the turning-point in
related Scandinavian ballads with which it must once have agreed
in all important particulars. This is the so-called
"dead-naming," which has an important place in popular
superstition. The incident appears as follows in the Danish
'Ribold and Guldborg,' (Grundtvig, No. 82): Ribold is fleeing
with his love Guldborg. They are pursued by Guldborg's father and
her brothers. Ribold bids Guldborg hold his horse, and, whatever
may happen, not to call him by name. Ribold cuts down six or
seven of her brothers and her father, besides others of her kin;
the youngest brother only is left, and Guldborg in an agony calls
upon Ribold to spare him, to carry tidings to her mother. No
sooner was his name pronounced than Ribold received a mortal
wound. The English and Scottish ballads preserve only the
faintest trace of the knight's injunction not to name him. Cf.
<b>A</b>*, st. 27, with 'Erlinton,' <b>A</b>* st. 15, <b>B</b>,
st. 14.</p>

<p>'Earl Brand,' with the many Scandinavian ballads of the same
group, would seem to belong among the numerous ramifications of
the Hildesaga. Of these, the second lay of Helgi Hundingslayer,
in the Poetic Edda. and 'Waltharius,' the beautiful poem of
Ekkehard, are most like the ballads. See also 'Erlinton' (No. 8).
Percy, in his Reliques, expanded the fragmentary version <b>C</b>
to five times its actual length.</p>
