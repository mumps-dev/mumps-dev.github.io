been compiled at a time when such forms had gone out of use, and
these may be relics of the ballads from which this little epic
was made up; or the whole poem may have been put together as
early as 1400, or before. There are no firm grounds on which to
base an opinion.</p>

<p>No notice of Robin Hood has been down to this time recovered
earlier than that which was long ago pointed out by Percy as
occurring in Piers Plowman, and this, according to Professor
Skeat, cannot be older than about 1377.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Sloth, in that poem,

with his paternoster: B, passus v, 401 f, Skeat, ed. 1886, I,

infrequent in the following century.</p>

<p>In Wyntoun's Chronicle of Scotland, put 
at about 1420, there is this passage, standing 
quite by itself, under the year 1283:</p>

<p>Disorderly persons undertook, it seems, to imitate Robin Hood
and his men. In the year 1417, says Stowe, one, by his
counterfeit name called Fryer Tucke, with many other malefactors,
committed many robberies in the counties of Surrey and Sussex,
whereupon the king sent out his writs for their apprehension:

<p>These passages show the popularity of Robin Hood ballads for a
century or more before the time when the Gest was printed, a
popularity which was fully established at the beginning of this
period, and unquestionably extended back to a much earlier day.
Of these ballads, there have come down to us in a comparatively
ancient form the following: those from which the Gest (printed,
perhaps, before 1500) was composed, being at least four, Robin
Hood, the Knight and the Monk, Robin Hood, Little John and the
Sheriff, Robin Hood and the King, and Robin Hood's Death (a
fragment); '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_119.html">Robin Hood and the Monk</a>,' No 118, more properly Robin
Hood rescued by Little John, Manuscript of about 1450, but not
for that older than the ballads of the Gest; 'Robin Hood and Guy
of Gisborn,' No 119, Percy Manuscript c. 1650; '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_120.html">Robin Hood's Death</a>,'
No 120, Percy Manuscript and late garlands; '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_121.html">Robin Hood and the Potter</a>,'
No 121, Manuscript of about 1500, later,
perhaps, than any other of the group.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Besides these there
are thirty-two ballads, Nos 122-153. For twenty-two of these we
have the texts of broadsides and garlands of the seventeenth
century,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> four of the same being also found in the Percy
Manuscript; eight occur in garlands, etc., of the last century,
one of these same in the Percy Manuscript, and another in an
eighteenth-century Manuscript; one is derived from a suspicious
nineteenth-century Manuscript, and one from nineteenth-century
tradition. About half a dozen of these thirty-two have in them
something of the old popular quality; as many more not the least
smatch of it. Fully a dozen are variations, sometimes wearisome,
sometimes sickening, upon the theme 'Robin Hood met with his
match.' A considerable part of the Robin Hood poetry looks like
char-work done for the petty press, and should be judged as such.
The earliest of these ballads, on the other hand, are among the
best of all ballads, and perhaps none in English please so many
and please so long.</p>

<p>That a considerable number of fine ballads of this cycle have
been lost will appear all but certain when we remember that three
of the very best are found each in only one manuscript.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Robin Hood is absolutely a creation of the ballad-muse. The
earliest mention we have of him is as the subject of ballads. The
only two early historians who speak of him as a ballad-hero,
pretend to have no information about him except what they derive
from ballads, and show that they have none other by the
description they give of him; this description being in entire
conformity with ballads in our possession, one of which is found
in a Manuscript as old as the older of these two writers.</p>

<p>Robin Hood is a yeoman, outlawed for reasons not given but
easily surmised, "courteous and free," religious in sentiment,
and above all reverent of the Virgin, for the love of whom he is
respectful to all women. He lives by the king's deer (though he
loves no man in the world so much as his king) and by levies on
the superfluity of the higher orders, secular and spiritual,
bishops and archbishops, abbots, bold barons, and knights,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
but harms no husbandman or yeoman, and is friendly to poor men
generally, imparting to them of what he takes from the rich.
Courtesy, good temper, liberality, and manliness are his chief
marks; for courtesy and good temper he is a popular Gawain.
Yeoman as he is, he has a kind of royal dignity, a princely
grace, and a gentleman-like refinement of humor. This is the
Robin Hood of the Gest especially; the late ballads debase this
primary conception in various ways and degrees.</p>

<p>This is what Robin Hood is, and it is equally important to
observe what he is not. He has no sort of political character, in
the Gest or any other ballad. This takes the ground from under
the feet of those who seek to assign him a place in history.
Wyntoun, who gives four lines to Robin Hood, is quite precise. He
is likely to have known of the adventure of King Edward and the
outlaw, and he puts Robin under Edward I, at the arbitrary date
of 1283, a hundred and forty years before his own time. Bower,
without any kind of ceremony, avouches our hero to have been one
of the proscribed followers of Simon de Montfort, and this
assertion of Bower is adopted and maintained by a writer in the
London and Westminster Review, 1840, XXXIII, 424.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_016','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Major,
who probably knew some ballad of Richard I and Robin Hood, offers
a simple conjecture that Robin flourished about Richard's time,
"circa h&aelig;c tempora, ut auguror," and this is the
representation in Matthew Parker's 'True Tale,' which many have
repeated, not always with ut auguror; as Scott, with whom no one
can quarrel, in the inexpressibly delightful Ivanhoe, and Thierry
in his Conqu&ecirc;te de l'Angleterre, Book xi, IV, 81 ff, ed.
1830, both of whom depict Robin Hood as the chief of a troop of
Saxon bandits, Thierry making him an imitator of Hereward.
Hunter, again, The Ballad-Hero, Robin Hood, p. 48, interprets the
King Edward of the Gest as Edward II, and makes Robin Hood an
adherent of the Earl of Lancaster in the fatal insurrection of
1322. No one of these theories has anything besides ballads for a
basis except Hunter's. Hunter has an account-book in which the
name Robin Hood occurs; as to which see further on, under stanzas
414-450 of the Gest. Hereward the Saxon, Fulk Fitz Warine,
Eustace the Monk, Wallace, all outlaws of one kind or another,
are celebrated in romantic tales or poems, largely fabulous,
which resemble in a general way, and sometimes in particulars,
the traditional ballads about Robin Hood;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_017','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> but these outlaws
are recognized by contemporary history.</p>

<p>The chief comrades of Robin Hood are: Robin Hood and the Monk,
Little John, Scathlok (Scarlok. Scarlet), and Much; to these the
Gest adds Gilbert of the White Hand and Reynold, 292 f. A friar
is not a member of his company in the older ballads. A curtal, or
cutted friar, called Friar Tuck in the title, but not in the
ballad, has a fight with Robin Hood in No 123, and is perhaps to
be regarded as having accepted Robin's invitation to join his
company; this, however, is not said. Friar Tuck is simply named
as one of Robin's troop in two broadsides, No 145, No 147, but
plays no part in them. These two broadsides also name Maid
Marian, who appears elsewhere only in a late and entirely
insignificant ballad, No 150.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_018','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Friar Tuck is a character in each of two Robin Hood plays,
both of which we have, unluckily, only in a fragmentary state.
One of these plays, dating as far back as 1475, presents scenes
from Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborn, followed, without any link,
by others from some ballad of a rescue of Robin Hood from the
sheriff; to which extracts from still other ballads may have been
annexed. In this play the friar has no special mark; he simply
makes good use of his bow. The other play, printed by Copland
with the Gest, not much before 1550, treats more at length the
story of Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar, and then that of Robin
Hood and the Potter, again, and naturally, without connection.
The conclusion is wanting, and the play may have embraced still
other ballads. The Friar in this is a loose and jovial fellow,
and gave the hint for Scott's Clerk of Copmanhurst.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_019','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The second of the Robin Hood plays is described in the title
as "very proper to be played in May-games." These games were in
the sixteenth century, and, it would seem, before, often a medley
of many things. They were not limited to the first day of May, or
even to the month of May; they might occur in June as well. They
were not uniform, and might include any kind of performance or
spectacle which suited the popular taste. "I find," says Stow,
"that in the moneth of May, the citizens of London, of all
estates, lightlie in every parish, or sometimes two or three
parishes joyning together, had their several Mayinges, and did
fetch in Maypoles, with divers warlike shewes, with good archers,
morrice-dancers, and other devices for pastime all the day long;
and towards the evening they had stage-playes and bonefires in
the streetes."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_020','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In the Diary of Henry Machyn we read that on
the twenty-sixth of May, 1555, there was a goodly May-game at St.
Martins in the Field, with giant and hobby-horses, morris-dance
and other minstrels; and on the third day of June following, a
goodly May-game at Westminster, with giants and devils, and three
morris-dancers, and many disguised, and the Lord and Lady of the
May rode gorgeously, with divers minstrels playing. On the
thirtieth of May, 1557, there was a goodly May-game in Fenchurch
Street, in which the Nine Worthies rode, and they had speeches,
and the morris-dance, and the Sowdan, and the Lord and Lady of
the May, and more besides. And again, on the twenty-fourth of
June, 1559, there was a May-game, with a giant, the Nine
Worthies, with speeches, a goodly pageant with a queen, St.
George and the Dragon, the morris-dance, and afterwards Robin
Hood and Little John, and Maid Marian and Friar Tuck, and they
had speeches round about London. (Pp 89, 137, 201.)<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_021','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>In the rural districts the May-game was naturally a much
simpler affair. The accounts of the chamberlains and
churchwardens of Kingston upon Thames for Mayday, 23 Henry VII-28
Henry VIII, 1507-36, contain charges for the morris, the Lady,
Little John, Robin Hood, and, Maid Marian; the accounts for 21
Henry VII-1 Henry VIII relate to expenses for the Kyngham, and a
king and queen are mentioned, presumably king and queen of May;
under 24 Henry VII the "cost of the Kyngham and Robyn Hode are
entered together."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_022','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

representation of a May-game with the morris) has, besides a
fool, a piper and six dancers, a May-pole, a hobby-horse, a
friar, and a lady, and the lady, being crowned, is to be taken as
Queen of May.</p>

<p>What concerns us is the part borne by Robin Hood, John, and
the Friar in these games, and Robin's relation to Maid Marian. In
Ellis's edition of Brand's Antiquities, I, 214, note h, we are
told that Robin Hood is styled King of May in The Book of the
Universal Kirk of Scotland. This is a mistake, and an important
mistake. In April, 1577, the General Assembly requested the king
to "discharge [prohibit] playes of Robin Hood, King of May, and
sick others, on the Sabboth day." In April, 1578, the fourth
session, the king and council were supplicated to discharge "all
kynd of insolent play is, as King of May, Robin Hood, and sick
others, in the moneth of May, played either be bairnes at the
schools, or others"; and the subject was returned to in the
eighth session. We know from various sources that plays, founded
on the ballads, were sometimes performed in the course of the
games. We know that archers sometimes personated Robin Hood and
his men in the May-game.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_024','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The relation of Robin Hood, John,
and the Friar to the May-game morris is obscure. "It plainly
appears," says Ritson, "that Robin Hood, Little John, the Friar,
and Maid Marian were fitted out at the same time with the
morris-dancers, and consequently, it would seem, united with them
in one and the same exhibition," meaning the morris. But he adds,
with entire truth, in a note: "it must be confessed that no other
direct authority has been met with for constituting Robin Hood
and Little John integral characters of the morris-dance."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_025','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
And further, with less truth so far as the Friar is concerned:
"that Maid Marian and the Friar were almost constantly such is
proved beyond the possibility of a doubt." The Friar is found in
Tollet's window, which Douce speaks of, cautiously, as a
representation of an English May-game <i>and</i> morris-dance.
The only "direct authority," so far as I am aware, for the
Friar's being a party in the morris-dance (unconnected with the
May-game) is the late authority of Ben Jonson's Masque of the
Metamorphosed Gipsies, 1621, cited by Tollet in his Memoir; where
it is said that the absence of a Maid Marian and a friar is a
surer mark than the lack of a hobby-horse that a certain company
cannot be morris-dancers.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_026','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The lady is an essential

the appellation of Maid Marian in the English morris is unknown.
The earliest occurrence of the name seems to be in Barclay's

of Foles, but originally printed soon after 1500:" Ritson, I,
lxxxvii, ed. 1832. Warton suggested a derivation from the French
Marion, and the idea is extremely plausible. Robin and Marion
were the subject of innumerable motets and pastourelles of the
thirteenth century, and the hero and heroine of a very pretty and
lively play, more properly comic opera, composed by Adam de la
Halle not far from 1280. We know from a document of 1392 that
this play was annually performed at Angers, at Whitsuntide, and
we cannot doubt that it was a stock-piece in many places, as from
its merits it deserved to be. There are as many proverbs about
Robin and Marion as there are about Robin Hood, and the first
verse of the play, derived from an earlier song, is still (or was
fifty years ago) in the mouths of the peasant girls of
Hainault.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_029','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In the May-game of June, 1559, described by
Machyn, after many other things, they had "Robin Hood and Little
John," and "Maid Marian and Friar Tuck," some dramatic scene,
pantomime, or pageant, probably two; but there is nothing of Maid
Marian in the two (fragmentary) Robin Hood plays which are
preserved, both of which, so far as they go, are based on
ballads. Anthony Munday, towards the end of the sixteenth
century, made a play, full of his own inventions, in which
Robert, Earl of Huntington, being out-lawed, takes refuge in
Sherwood, with his chaste love Matilda, daughter of Lord
Fitzwaters, and changes his name to Robin Hood, hers to Maid
Marian.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_030','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> One S.G., a good deal later, wrote a very bad
ballad about the Earl of Huntington and his lass, the only ballad
in which Maid Marian is more than a name. Neglecting these
perversions, Maid Marian is a personage in the May-game and
morris who is not infrequently paired with a friar, and sometimes
with Robin Hood, under what relation, in either case, we cannot
precisely say. Percy had no occasion to speak of her as Robin's
concubine, and Douce none to call her Robin's paramour.</p>

<p>That ballads about Robin Hood were familiar throughout England
and Scotland we know from early testimony. Additional evidence of
his celebrity is afforded by the connection of his name with a
variety of natural objects and archaic remains over a wide extent
of country.</p>

<p>"Cairns on Blackdown in Somersetshire, and barrows near to
Whitby in Yorkshire and Ludlow in Shropshire, are termed Robin
Hood's pricks or butts; lofty natural eminences in
Gloucestershire and Derbyshire are Robin Hood's hills; a huge
rock near Matlock is Robin Hood's Tor; an ancient boundary stone
in Lincolnshire is Robin Hood's cross; a presumed loggan, or
rocking-stone, in Yorkshire is Robin Hood's penny-stone; a
fountain near Nottingham, another between Doncaster and
Wakefield, and one in Lancashire are Robin Hood's wells; a cave
in Nottinghamshire is his stable; a rude natural rock in Hope
Dale is his chair; a chasm at Chatsworth is his leap; Blackstone
Edge, in Lancashire, is his bed; ancient oaks, in various parts
of the country, are his trees."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_031','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> All sorts of traditions are
fitted to the localities where they are known. It would be an
exception to ordinary rules if we did not find Robin Hood trees
and Robin Hood wells and Robin Hood hills. But, says Wright, in
his essay on the Robin Hood ballads (p. 208), the connection of
Robin Hood's name with mounds and stones is perhaps one of the
strongest proofs of his mythic character, as if Robin Hood were
conceived of as a giant. The fact in question is rather a proof
that those names were conferred at a time when the real character
of Robin Hood was dimly remembered. In the oldest ballads Robin
Hood is simply a stout yeoman, one of the best that ever bare
bow; in the later ballads he is repeatedly foiled in contests
with shepherds and beggars. Is it supposable that those who knew
of him even at his best estate, could give him a loggan for a
penny-stone? No one has as yet undertaken to prove that the
ballads are later than the names.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_032','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Mounds and stones bear

<p>Kuhn, starting with the assumption that the mythical character
of Robin Hood is fully established (by traditions posterior to
the ballads and contradictory to their tenor), has sought to show
that our courteous outlaw is in particular one of the
manifestations of Woden. The hobby-horse, which, be it borne in
mind, though now and then found in the May-game or morris-dance,
was never intimately associated, perhaps we may say never at all
associated, with Robin Hood, represents, it is maintained, Woden.
The fundamental grounds are these. In a Christmas, New Year, or
Twelfth Day sport at Paget's Bromley, Staffordshire, the rider of
the hobby-horse held a bow and arrow in his hands, with which he
made a snapping noise. In a modern Christmas festivity in Kent,
the young people would affix the head of a horse to a pole about
four feet in length, and tie a cloth round the head to conceal
one of the party, who, by pulling a string attached to the
horse's lower jaw, produced a snapping noise as he moved along.
This ceremony, according to the reporter, was called a
<b>hoodening</b>, and the figure of the horse a <b>hooden</b>, "a
wooden horse."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_034','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The word hooden, according to Kuhn, we may
unhesitatingly expound as Woden; Hood is a corruption of
"Hooden," and this Hooden again conducts us to Woden.</p>

<p>The sport referred to is explained in Pegge's Alphabet of
Kenticisms (collected 1735-36), under the name hooding, as a
country masquerade at Christmas time, which in Derbyshire they
call guising, and in other places mumming; and to the same effect
in the Rev. W.D. Parish's Dictionary of the Kentish Dialect (soon
to be published) under hoodening, which word is an obvious
corruption, or secondary form, of hooding. The word hooding,
applied to the sport, means just what it does in the old English
hooding-cloth, a curtain; that is, a covering, and so a disguise
by covering. It is true that wooden is pronounced hooden,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_035','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
or ooden, in Kent, and that the hobby-horse had a wooden head,
but it is quite inconceivable that the sport should receive its
name from a circumstance so subordinate as the material of which
the horse was made. Such an interpretation would hardly be
thought of had not hooding in its proper sense long been
obsolete. That this is the case is plain from two facts: the
hooding used to be accompanied with carol-singing, and the Rev.
Mr. Parish informs us that carol-singing on Christmas Eve is
still called hoodening at Monckton, in East Kent. The form
Hooden, from which Robin's name is asserted by Kuhn to be
corrupted, is invented for the occasion. I suppose that no one
will think that the hobby-horse-rider's carrying a bow and
arrows, in the single instance of the Staffordshire sport,
conduces at all to the identifying of Robin Hood with the
hobby-horse. Whether the Hobby-Horse represents Woden is not
material here. It is enough that the Hobby-Horse cannot be shown
to represent Robin Hood.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_036','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>I cannot admit that even the shadow of a case has been made
out by those who would attach a mythical character either to
Robin Hood or to the outlaws of Inglewood, Adam Bell, Clim of the
Clough, and William of Cloudesly.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_037','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Ballads of other nations, relating to classes of men living in
revolt against authority and society, may be expected to show
some kind of likeness to the English outlaw-ballads, and such
resemblances will be pointed out upon occasion. Spanish broadside
ballads dating from the end of the sixteenth century commemorate
the valientes and guapos of cities, robbers and murderers of the
most flaunting and flagitious description: Duran, Romancero, Nos
1331-36, 1339-43, II, 367 ff.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_038','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> These display towards
corregidores, alcaldes, custom-house officers, and all the
ministers of government an hostility corresponding to that of
Robin Hood against the sheriff; they empty the jails and deliver
culprits from the gallows; reminding us very faintly of the Robin
Hood broadsides, as of the rescues in Nos 140, 141, the Progress
to Nottingham, No 139, in which Robin Hood, at the age of
fifteen, kills fifteen foresters, or of Young Gamwell, in No 128,
who begins his career by killing his father's steward,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_039','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> But
Robin Hood and his men, in the most degraded of the broadsides,
are tame innocents and law-abiding citizens beside the guapos.
The Klephts, whose songs are preserved in considerable numbers,
mostly from the last century and the present, have the
respectability of being engaged, at least in part, in a war
against the Turks, and the romance of wild mountaineers. They,
like Robin Hood, had a marked animosity against monks, and they
put beys to ransom as he would an abbot or a sheriff. There are
Magyar robber-ballads in great number;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_040','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> some of these

<p>The Gest is a popular epic, composed from several ballads by a
poet of a thoroughly congenial spirit. No one of the ballads from
which it was made up is extant in a separate shape, and some
portions of the story may have been of the compiler's own
invention. The decoying of the sheriff into the wood, stanzas
181-204, is of the same derivation as the last part of Robin Hood
and the Potter, No 121, Little John and Robin Hood exchanging
parts; the conclusion, 451-56, is of the same source as Robin
Hood's Death, No 120. Though the tale, as to all important
considerations, is eminently original, absolutely so as to the
conception of Robin Hood, some traits and incidents, as might be
expected, are taken from what we may call the general stock of
mediaeval fiction.</p>

<p>The story is a three-ply web of the adventures of Robin Hood
with a knight, with the sheriff of Nottingham, and with the king
(the concluding stanzas, 451-56, being a mere epilogue), and may
be decomposed accordingly. I. How Robin Hood relieved a knight,
who had fallen into poverty, by lending him money on the security
of Our Lady, the first fit, 1-81; how the knight recovered his
lands, which had been pledged to Saint Mary Abbey, and set forth
to repay the loan, the second fit, 82-143; how Robin Hood, having
taken twice the sum lent from a monk of this abbey, declared that
Our Lady had discharged the debt, and would receive nothing more
from the knight, the fourth fit, 205-280. II. How Little John
insidiously took service with Robin Hood's standing enemy, the
sheriff of Nottingham, and put the sheriff into Robin Hood's
hands, the third fit, 144-204; how the sheriff, who had sworn an
oath to help and not to harm Robin Hood and his men,
treacherously set upon the outlaws at a shooting-match, and they
were fain to take refuge in the knight's castle; how, missing of
Robin Hood, the sheriff made prisoner of the knight; and how
Robin Hood slew the sheriff and rescued the knight, the fifth and
sixth fit, 281-353. III. How the king, coming in person to
apprehend Robin Hood and the knight, disguised himself as an
abbot, was stopped by Robin Hood, feasted on his own deer, and
entertained with an exhibition of archery, in the course of which
he was recognized by Robin Hood, who asked his grace and received
a promise thereof, on condition that he and his men should enter
into the king's service; and how the king, for a jest, disguised
himself and his company in the green of the outlaws, and going
back to Nottingham caused a general flight of the people, which
he stopped by making himself known; how he pardoned the knight;
and how Robin Hood, after fifteen months in the king's court,
heart-sick and deserted by all his men but John and Scathlock,
obtained a week's leave of the king to go on a pilgrimage to
Saint Mary Magdalen of Barnsdale, and would never come back in
two-and-twenty years, the seventh and eighth fit, 354-450. A
particular analysis may be spared, seeing that many of the
details will come out incidentally in what follows.</p>

<p>Barnsdale, Robin Hood's haunt in the Gest, 3, 21, 82, 134,
213, 262, 440, 442, is a woodland region in the West Riding of
Yorkshire, a little to the south of Pontefract and somewhat
further to the north of Doncaster. The river Went is its northern
boundary. "The traveller enters upon it [from the south] a little
beyond a well-known place called Robin Hood's Well [some ten
miles north of Doncaster, near Skelbrook], and he leaves it when
he has descended to Wentbridge." (For Wentbridge, see No 121, st.
6; the Gest, 135 1 .) A little to the west is Wakefield, and
beyond Wakefield, between that town and Halifax, was the priory
of Kyrkesly or Kirklees. The Sayles, 18, was a very small tenancy
of the manor of Pontefract. The great North Road, formerly so
called, and here, 18, denominated Watling Street (as Roman roads
often are), crosses Barnsdale between Doncaster and
Ferrybridge.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_041','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Saint Mary Abbey, "here besyde," 54, was at
York, and must have been a good twenty miles from Barnsdale. The
knight, 126<sup>4</sup>, is said to be "at home in Verysdale."
Wyresdale (now Over and Nether Wyersdale) was an extensive tract
of wild country, part of the old forest of Lancashire, a few
miles to the southeast of Lancaster. The knight's son had slain a
knight and a squire of Lancaster, a, Lancashire, b, f, g, 53. It
is very likely, therefore, that the knight's castle, in the
original ballad, was in Lancashire. However this may be, it is
put in the Gest, 309 f, on the way between Nottingham and Robin
Hood's retreat, which must be assumed to be Barnsdale. From it,
again, Barnsdale is easily accessible to the knight's wife, 334
f.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_042','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Wherever it lay or lies, the distance from Nottingham or
from Barnsdale, as also the distance from Nottingham to Barnsdale

the forest, and finds the sheriff still at his sport: 155 f, 168,
176-82. We must not be nice. Robin Hood has made a vow to go from
London to Barnsdale barefoot. The distance thither and back would
not be much short of three hundred and fifty miles. King Edward
allows him a seven-night, and no longer, 442 f. The compiler of
the Gest did not concern himself to adjust these matters. There
was evidently at one time a Barnsdale cycle and a Sherwood cycle
of Robin Hood ballads. The sheriff of Nottingham would belong to
the Sherwood series (to which Robin Hood and the Monk
appertains). He is now a capital character in all the old Robin
Hood ballads. If he was adopted from the Sherwood into the
Barnsdale set, this was done without a rearrangement of the
topography.</p>

<p>5-7. Robin Hood will not dine until he has some guest that can
pay handsomely for his entertainment, 18, 19, 206, 209; dinner,
accordingly, is sometimes delayed a long time, 25, 30, 143, 220;
to Little John's impatience, 5, 16, 206, 211. This habit of
Robin's seems to be a humorous imitation of King Arthur, who in
numerous romances will not dine till some adventure presents
itself; a custom which, at least on one occasion, proves
vexatious to his court. Cf. I, 257 f.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_045','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>8-10. Robin's general piety and his special devotion to the
Virgin are again to be remarked in No 118. There is a tale of a
knight who had a castle near a public road, and robbed everybody
that went by, but said his Ave every day, and never allowed
anything to interfere with his so doing, in Legenda Aurea, c. 51,
Grasse, p. 221; Hagen, Gesammtabenteuer, III, 563, No 86; Morlini
Novell&aelig;, Paris, 1855, p. 269, No 17, etc.</p>

<p>Fulk Fitz Warine, nor any of his, during the time of his
outlawry would ever do hurt to any one except the king and his
knights: Wright, p. 77 f.</p>

<p>45. "Distraint of knighthood," or the practice of requiring
military tenants who held 20 <i>l</i>. per annum to receive
knighthood, or pay a composition, began under Henry III, as early
as 1224, and was continued by Edward I. This was regarded as a
very serious oppression under James I and Charles I, and was
abolished in 1642. Stubbs, Constitutional History, II, 281 f;
Hallam, Constitutional History, ed. 1854, I, 338, note x, II, 9,
99.</p>

<p>62-66. The knight has no security to offer for a loan "but God
that dyed on a tree," and such security, or that of the saints,
is peremptorily rejected by Robin; but when the knight says that
he can offer no other, unless it be Our Lady, the Virgin is
instantly accepted as entirely satisfactory. In a well-known
miracle of Mary, found in most of the larger collections, a
Christian, who resorts to a Jew to borrow money, tenders Jesus as
security, and the Jew, who regards Jesus as a just man and a
prophet, though not divine, is willing to lend on the terms
proposed. The Christian, not being able, as he says, to produce
Jesus Christ in person, takes the Jew to a church, and, standing
before an image of the Virgin and Child, causes him to take the
hand of the Child, saying, Lord Jesus Christ, whose image I have
given as pledge for this money, and whom I have offered this Jew
as my surety, I beg and entreat that, if I shall by any chance be
prevented from returning the money to this man upon the day
fixed, but shall give it to thee, thou wilt return it to him in
such manner and form as may please thee. In the sequel this
miraculous interposition becomes necessary, and the money is
punctually restored, the act of grace being implicitly or
distinctly attributed to Mary rather than her Son; distinctly in
an English form of the legend, where the Christian, especially

<p>107. The abbot had retained the chief justice "by robe and
fee," to counsel and aid him in the spoliation of the knight, 93.
Taking and giving of robes and fees for such purposes is defined
as conspiracy in a statute of Edward I, 1305-06; and by another
statute, 20 Edward III, c. vi, 1346, justices are required to
swear that they will take robes and fees from no man but the
king: et que vos ne prendrez fee, tant come vos serez justicz, ne
robes, de nul homme, graunt ne petit, sinoun du roi meismes.
Statutes of the Realm, I, 145, 305: cited by J. Lewelyn Curtis,
in Notes and Queries, S.I, VI, 479 f. All the English judges,
including the chief justice, were convicted of bribery and were
removed, under Edward I, 1289.</p>

<p>121. The knight would have given something for the use of the
four hundred pound had the abbot been civil, though under no
obligation to pay interest. In 270 the knight proffers Robin
twenty mark (3 per cent) for his courtesy, which seemingly small
sum was to be accompanied with the valuable gift of a hundred
bows and a hundred sheaf of peacock-feathered, silver-nocked
arrows. But though the abbot had not lent for usury, still less
had he lent for charity. The knight's lands were to be forfeited
if the loan should not be punctually returned, 86 f, 94, 106; and
of this the knight was entirely aware, 85. "As for mortgaging or
pawning," says Bacon, Of Usury, "either men will not take pawns
without use, or, if they do, they will look precisely for the
forfeiture. I remember a cruel moneyed man in the country that
would say. The devil take this usury; it keeps us from
forfeitures of mortgages and bonds." But troubles, legal or
other, might ensue upon this hard-dealing unless the knight would
give a quittance, 117 f.</p>

<p>135-37. A ram was the prize for an ordinary wrestling-match;
but this is an occasion which brings together all the best yeomen
of the West Country, and the victor is to have a bull, a horse
saddled and bridled, a pair of gloves, a ring, and a pipe of
wine. In Gamely n "there was set up a ram and a ring," v. 172.</p>

<p>181-204. The sheriff is decoyed into the wood by Robin Hood in
No 121, 56-69, No 122, <b>A</b>, 18-25, <b>B</b>, 20-27, as here
by Little John. Fulk Fitz Warine gets his enemy, King John, into
his power by a like stratagem. Fulk, disguised as a collier, is
asked by King John if he has seen a stag or doe pass. He has seen
a horned beast; it had long horns. He offers to take the king to
the place where he saw it, and begs the king to wait while he
goes into the thicket to drive the beast that way. Fulk's men are
in the forest: he tells them that he has brought the king with
only three knights; they rush out and seize the king. Fulk says
he will have John's life, but the king promises to restore Fulk's
heritage and all that had been taken from him and his men, and to
be his friend forever after. A pledge of faith is exacted and
given, and very happy is the king so to escape. But the king
keeps the forced oath no better than the sheriff. Wright, p. 145
ff. There is a passage which has the same source, though
differing in details, in Eustace the Monk, Michel, pp. 36-39, vv
995-1070. The story is incomparably better here than
elsewhere.</p>

<p>213-33. The black monks are Benedictines. There are two
according to 213 f, 218, 225<sup>4</sup>, but the high cellarer
only (who in 91-93 is exultant over the knight's forfeiture) is
of consequence, and the other is made no account of. Seven score
of wight young men, 229<sup>3</sup>, is the right number for a
band of outlaws; so Gamelyn, v. 628. The sheriff has his seven
score in Guy of Gisborn, 13.</p>

<p>243-47. "What is in your coffers?" So Eustace the monk to the
merchant, v. 938, p. 34, Michel: "Di-moi combien tu as d'argent."
The merchant tells the exact truth, and Eustace, having verified
the answer by counting, returns all the money, saying, If you had
lied in the least, you would not have carried off a penny. When
Eustace asks the same question of the abbot, v. 1765, p. 64, the
abbot answers, after the fashion of our cellarer, Four silver
marks. Eustace finds thirty marks, and returns to the abbot the
four which he had confessed.</p>

<p>213-272. Nothing was ever more felicitously told, even in the
best <i>dit</i> or <i>fabliau</i>, than the "process" of Our
Lady's repaying the money which had been lent on her security.
Robin's slyly significant welcome to the monk upon learning that
he is of Saint Mary Abbey, his professed anxiety that Our Lady is
wroth with him because she has not sent him his pay, John's
comfortable suggestion that perhaps the monk has brought it,
Robin's incidental explanation of the little business in which
the Virgin was a party, and request to see the silver in case the
monk has come upon her affair, are beautiful touches of humor,
and so delicate that it is all but brutal to point them out. The
story, however, is an old one, and was known, perhaps, wherever
monks were known. A complete parallel is afforded by Pauli's
Schimpf und Ernst, No 59 (c. 1515). A nobleman took a burgess's
son prisoner in war, carried him home to his castle, and shut him
up in a tower. After lying there a considerable time, the
prisoner asked and obtained an interview with his captor, and
said: Dear lord, I am doing no good here to you or myself, since
my friends will not send my ransom. If you would let me go home,
I would come back in eight weeks and bring you the money. Whom
will you give for surety? asked the nobleman. I have no one to
offer, replied the prisoner, but the Lord God, and will swear you
an oath by him to keep my word. The nobleman was satisfied, made
his captive swear the oath, and let him go. The hero sold all
that he owned, and raised the money, but was three weeks longer
in so doing than the time agreed upon. The nobleman, one day,
when he was riding out with a couple of servants, fell in with an
abbot or friar who had two fine horses and a man. See here, my
good fellows, said the young lord; that monk is travelling with
two horses, as fine as any knight, when he ought to be riding on
an ass. Look out now, we will play him a turn. So saying, he rode
up to the monk, seized the bridle of his horse, and asked, Sir,
who are you? Who is your lord? The monk answered, I am a servant
of God, and he is my lord. You come in good time, said the
nobleman. I had a prisoner, and set him free upon his leaving
your lord with me as a surety. But I can get nothing from this
lord of yours; he is above my power; so I will lay hands on his
servant; and accordingly made the monk go with him afoot to the
castle, where he took from him all that he had. Shortly after,
his prisoner appeared, fell at his feet, and wished to pay the
ransom, begging that he would not be angry, for the money could
not be got sooner. But the nobleman said, Stand up, my good man.
Keep your money, and go whither you will, for your surety has
paid your ransom. Ed. Oesterley, p. 49. The gist of the story is
in Jacques de Vitry, Sermones Vulgares, fol. 62, Manuscript
17,509, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris; Scala Celi (1480),
159 b, "De Restitucione," and elsewhere: see Oesterly's note, p.
480. A very amusing variety is the <i>fabliau</i> Du povre

<p>293<sup>3</sup>. Reynolde. Possibly Little John borrows this
Reynolde's name in 149, but there is no apparent reason why he
should. In the following very strange, and to me utterly
unintelligible, piece in Ravenscroft's Deuteromelia, which may
have been meant to have only enough sense to sing, Renold, a
miller's son, mickle of might (was he rechristened Much?),
becomes one of Robin Hood's men. (Deuteromelia, p. 4: London, for
Tho. Adams, 1609.)</p>

<p>302-05. The Klepht Giphtakis, wounded in knee and hand,
exclaims: Where are you, my brother, my friend? Come back and
take me off, or take off my head, lest the Turk should do so, and
carry it to that dog of an Ali Pacha. (1790. Fauriel, 1, 20;
Zambelios, p. 621, No 32; Passow, p. 52, No 61.)</p>

<p>357-59. The king traverses the whole length of Lancashire and
proceeds to Plumpton Park, missing many of his deer. Camden,
Britannia, II, 175, ed. 1772, places Plumpton Park on the bank of
the Petterel, in Cumberland, east of Inglewood. (Hunter, p. 30,
citing no authority, says it was part of the forest of
Knaresborough, in Yorkshire.) Since this survey makes the king
wroth with Robin Hood, we must give a corresponding extent to
Robin's operations. And we remember that Wyntouu says that he
exercised his profession in Inglewood and Barnsdale.</p>

<p>371 ff. The story of the seventh fit has a general similitude
to the extensive class of tales, mostly jocular, represented by
'The King and the Miller;' as to which, see further on.</p>

<p>403-09. The sport of "pluck-buffet" (424<sup>3</sup>) is a
feature in the romance of Richard Coeur de Lion, 762-98, Weber,
II, 33 f. Richard is betrayed to the king of Almayne by a
minstrel to whom he had given a cold reception, and is put in
prison. The king's son, held the strongest man of the land,
visits the prisoner, and proposes to him an exchange of this
sort. The prince gives Richard a clout which makes fire spring
from his eyes, and goes off laughing, ordering Richard to be well
fed, so that he may have no excuse for returning a feeble blow
when he takes his turn. The next day, when the prince comes for
his payment, Richard, who has waxed his hand by way of
preparation, delivers a blow which breaks the young champion's
cheek-bone and fells him dead. There is another instance in 'The
Turke and Gowin,' Percy Manuscript, Hales and Furnivall, I, 91
ff.</p>

<p>414-450. Robin Hood is pardoned by King Edward on condition of
his leaving the green-wood with all his company, and taking
service at court. In the course of a twelvemonth,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_049','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> keeping
up his old profusion, Robin has spent not only all his own money,
but all his men's, in treating knights and squires, and at the
end of the year all his band have deserted him save John and
Scathlock. About this time, chancing to see young men shooting,
the recollection of his life in the woods comes over him so
powerfully that he feels that he shall die if he stays longer
with the king. He therefore affects to have made a vow to go to
Barnsdale "barefoot and woolward." Upon this plea he obtains from
the king leave of absence for a week, and, once more in the
forest, never reports for duty in two and twenty years.</p>

<p>Hunter, who could have identified Pigrogromitus and
Quinapalus, if he had given his mind to it, sees in this passage,
and in what precedes it of King Edward's trip to Nottingham, a
plausible semblance of historical reality.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_050','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Edward II, as
may be shown from Rymer's F&oelig;dera, made a progress in the
counties of York, Lancaster, and Nottingham, in the latter part
of the year 1323. He was in Yorkshire in August and September, in
Lancashire in October, at Nottingham November 923, spending
altogether five or six weeks in that neighborhood, and leaving it
a little before Christmas. "Now it will scarcely be believed, but
it is, nevertheless, the plain and simple truth, that in
documents preserved in the Exchequer, containing accounts of
expenses in the king's household, we find the name of Robyn Hode,
not once, but several times occurring, receiving, with about
eight and twenty others, the pay of 3<i>d</i>. a day, as one of
the 'vadlets, porteurs de la chambre' of the king;" these entries
running from March 24, 1324, to November 22 of the same year.
There are entries of payments to vadlets during the year
preceding, but unluckily the accountant has put down the sums in
gross, without specifying the names of persons who received
regular wages. This, as Hunter remarks, does not quite prove that
Robyn Hode had not been among these persons before Christmas,
1323, but, on the other hand, account-book evidence is lacking to
show that he had been. Hunter's interpretation of the data is
that Robyn Hode entered the king's service at Nottingham a little
before Christmas, 1323. If this was so, his career as porter was
not only brief, but pitiably checkered. His pay is docked for
five days' absence in May, again for eight days in August, then
for fifteen days in October. "He was growing weary of his new
mode of life." Seven days, once more, are deducted in November,
and under the 22d of that month we find this entry: Robyn Hode,
jadys un des porteurs, poar cas qil ne poait pluis travailler, de
donn par comandement, v.s. After this his name no longer
appears.</p>

<p>A simple way of reading the Exchequer documents is that one
Robert Hood, some time (and, for aught we know, a long time)
porter in the king's household, after repeatedly losing time, was
finally discharged, with a present of five shillings, because he
could not do his work. To detect "a remarkable coincidence
between the ballad and the record" requires not only a
theoretical prepossession, but an uncommon insensibility to the
ludicrous.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_051','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> But taking things with entire seriousness, there
is no correspondence between the ballad and the record other than
this: that Robin Hood, who is in the king's service, leaves it;
in the one instance deserting, and in the other being displaced.
Hunter himself does not, as in the case of Adam Bell, insist that
the name Robin Hood is "peculiar." He cites, p. 10, a Robert
Hood, citizen of London, who supplied the king's household with
beer, 28 Edward I, and a Robert Hood of Wakefield, twice
mentioned, 9, 10 Edward H.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d117_052','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Another Robert Hood at
Throckelawe, North umbria, is thrice mentioned in the Exchequer
Rolls, Edward I, 19, 20, 30: Rot. Orig. in Cur. Scac. Abbrev., I,
69, 73, 124. A Robert Hood is manucaptor for a burgess returned
from Lostwithiel, Cornwall, 7 Edward II, Parliamentary Writs, II,
1019, and another, of Howden, York, 10 Edward III, is noted in
the Calendar of Patent Rolls, p. 125, No 31, cited by Ritson. In
all these we have six Robin Hoods between 30 Edward I and 10
Edward III, a period of less than forty years.</p>
