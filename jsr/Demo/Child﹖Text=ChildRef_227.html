</ol>

<p><b>a</b>, from the collection of broadsides made by David
Laing, now in the possession of Lord Rosebery, may probably have
been printed at the beginning of the last century, at Edinburgh,
<b>b</b> was taken "from a tolerably old copy printed at
Glasgow." Excepting the lack of two stanzas, the variations from
a are mostly of slight consequence; two or three are for the
better, <b>c</b> (only the beginning, stanzas 1-4<sup>1</sup>)
was communicated by C.K. Sharpe, from a " Manuscript copy of some
antiquity." <b>d</b>-<b>g</b> are of no authority, <b>d</b>,
<b>e</b> are fragmentary stanzas, misremembered if not corrupted,
<b>f</b> has ten stanzas, eight of which (some with a word or two
changed) are from <b>d</b>. <b>g</b> is a washy
<i>rifacimento</i>.</p>

<p><b>d</b> is printed in Herd's Ancient and Modern Scottish
Songs, 1776, II, 3. The copy in Johnson's Museum, No 456, p. 469,
is <b>d</b> without the first stanza.</p>

<p>Stanzas 19-21 of <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and their representatives
in <b>d</b>, <b>e</b>, recall '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_200.html">The Gypsy Laddie</a>.'</p>

<p>Lizzie Baillie, of Castle Gary, Stirlingshire, while paying a
visit to a sister at Gartartan, Perthshire, makes an excursion to
Inchmahome, an island in Loch Menteith. Here she meets Duncan
Graham, who, against the opposition of her parents, persuades her
to prefer a Highland husband to any Lowland or English match.</p>

<p>"The heroine of this song," says Sharpe, "was a daughter of
Baillie of Castle Carey, and sister, as it is said, to the wife
of Macfarlane of Gartartan." The Baillies, as Maidment has shown,
acquired Castle Gary "at a comparatively recent date," and that
editor must be nearly, or quite, right in declaring the ballad to
be not older than the commencement of the last century. Buchan
has a bit of pseudo-history anent Lizie Baillie in his notes, at
II, 326.</p>

<p>The story is told in a somewhat disorderly way even in a, and
we may believe that we have not attained the original yet, though
this copy is much older than any that has appeared in previous
collections.</p>
