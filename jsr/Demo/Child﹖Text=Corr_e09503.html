<h3>95. The Maid Freed from the Gallows</h3>


<p>P. 346. Mr. Alfred Nutt has communicated to the Folk-Lore
Journal, VI, 144, 1888, the outline of a ballad in which, as in
some versions of the European continent, the man has the place of
the maid. But this may be a modern turn to the story, arising
from the disposition to mitigate a tragic tale. The ballad was
obtained "from a relative of Dr. Birbeck Hill's, in whose family
it is traditional. Mother, father, and brethren all refuse him
aid, but his sweetheart is kinder, and buys him off." For the
burden see <b>C</b> 6, which, as well as <b>B</b> 12, might
better have been printed as such.</p>

<p>Struppa's text of 'Scibilia Nobili' is repeated in
Salomone-Marino's Leggende p. siciliane in Poesia, p. 160, No 29.
The editor supplies defects and gives some varying readings from
another version, in which Scibilia is the love, not the wife, of
a cavalier. &mdash; Mango, Calabria, in Archivio, I, 394, No 75
(wife). &mdash; 'La Prigioniera,' Giannini, No 25, p. 195, two
copies, reduces the story to four or five stanzas. The sequel, No
26, p. 197, is likely to have been originally an independent
ballad. It is attached to 'Scibilia Nobili,' but is found
separately in Bernoni, XI, No 3, 'La Figlia snaturata,' Finamore,
Archivio, I, 212, 'Catarine.'</p>

<p>347 b. 'Fr&iacute;sa v&iacute;sa' is reprinted by Hammershaimb, 
F&aelig;r&oslash;sk Anthologi, p. 268, No 34. The editor expressly says that the ballad is used as a children's 
game, like the English <b>F</b>. So also are Danish <b>A</b>, 
and a Magyar ballad of like purport, to be mentioned 
presently.</p>

<p>348 b. <b>Danish</b>. <b>A</b>, in Kristensen's
Skattegraveren, 'Jomfruens udl&oslash;sning,' II, 49, No 279,
1884; B, III, 5, No 3, 1885. From tradition. Both versions agree
with the Swedish in all important points, and the language of
<b>B</b> points to a Swedish derivation.</p>

<p>349 a. Ransom for maid refused by father, mother, brother,
sister, and paid by lover: Little-Russian, Golovatsky, I, 50, No
11; II, 245, No 7. (W.W.)</p>

<p>34 9 b, 514 a. Man redeemed by maid when abandoned by his own
blood: Little-Russian, Golovatsky, I, 250, No 26; Servian, Vuk,
III, 547, No 83; Magyar-Croat, Kurelac, p. 254, No 61, p. 352, No
96. (W.W.)</p>

<p>In a Slovak ballad in Kollar, N&aacute;rodnie Zpiewanky, II,
13, translated by Herrmann, Ethnologische Mittheilungen, col. 42
f., John, in prison, writes to his father to ransom him; the
father asks how much would have to be paid; four hundred pieces
of gold and as many of silver; the father replies that he has not
so much, and his son must perish. An ineffectual letter to
mother, brother, sister, follows; then one to his sweetheart. She
brings a long rope, with which he is to let himself down from his
dungeon. If the rope proves too short, he is to add his long hair
(cf. I, 40 b, line 2, 486 b); and if it be still too short, he
may light upon her shoulders. John escapes. Nearly the same is
the Polish ballad translated in Waldbr&uuml;hl's Balalaika, which
is referred to II, 350 b.</p>

<p>A fragment of a Szekler ransom-ballad is found in Arany and
Gyulai's collection, III, 42: Herrmann, as above, col. 49.
Another form of love-test is very popular in Hungary, of which
Herrmann gives eight versions. In one of these, from a collection
made in 1813, Arany and Gyulai, I, 189 (Herrmann's IV), the story
is told with the conciseness of the English ballad. A snake has
crept into a girl's bosom: she entreats her father to take it
out; he dares not, and sends her to her mother; the mother has as
little devotion and courage as the father, and sends her to her
brother; she is successively passed on to sister-in-law,
brother-in-law, sister; then appeals to her lover, who instantly
does the service. This is the kernel, and perhaps all that is
original, in versions, I (of Herrmann), col. 34 f., contributed
by Kalmany; II, 36 f., contributed by Szab&oacute;; V, col. 38,
Kalmany, Koszor&uacute;k az Alf&ouml;ld vad
Vir&aacute;gaiob&oacute;l, I, 21, translated into German by
Wlislocki, Ungarische Revue, 1884, p. 344; VIII, col. 39,
K&aacute;lm&aacute;ny, Szeged N&eacute;pe, II, 13. In Herrmann,
VI, col. 38, K&aacute;lm&aacute;ny, Koszor&uacute;k, II, 62; VII,
col. 38 f., K&aacute;lm&aacute;ny, Szeged N&eacute;pe, II, 12;
and III, col. 37 (a fragment), young man and maid change parts.
In I, III, V (?), VI, VII, the father says he can better do
without a daughter (son) than without one of his hands, and the
youth (maid) would rather lose one of his (her) hands than his
(her) beloved.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_e09503_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In I the snake has been turned to a purse of
gold when the maid attempts to take it out; in II, according to a
prose and prosaic comment of the reciter, there was no snake, but
the girl had put a piece of gold in her bosom, and calls it a
yellow adder to experiment upon her family; in VII, again, there
is no snake, but a rouleau of gold, and the snake is explained
away in like manner in a comment to VIII. Even the transformation
in I is to be deprecated; the money in the others is a modern
depravation.</p>

<p>A brief ballad of the Transylvania Gipsies, communicated and
translated by Wlislocki, Ungarische Revue, 1884, p. 345 f.,
agrees with the second series of those above. A youth summons
mother and sister to take a reptile from his breast; they are
afraid; his sweetheart will do it if she dies. A very pretty
popular Gipsy tale to the same effect is given by Herrmann, col.
40 f.</p>

<p>A Roumanian ballad, 'Giurgiu,' closely resembling the Magyar
I, VII, from Pompiliu Miron's Balade populare romane, p. 41, is
given in translation by Herrmann, col. 106 ff.; a fragment of
another, with parts reversed, col. 213.</p>

<p>A man, to make trial of his blood-relations, begs father,
mother, etc., to take out a snake from his breast, and is refused
by all. His wife puts in her hand and takes out a pearl necklace,
which she receives as her reward: Servian, Vuk, I, No 289,
Herzegovine, No 136, Petranovic, Serajevo, 1867, p. 191, No 20;
Slavonian, Stojanovic', No 20. (W.W.)</p>

<p>There are many variations on this theme, of which one more may
be specified. A drowning girl given over by her family is saved
by her lover: Little-Russian, Golovatsky, II, 80, No 14, 104, No
18, 161, No 15, 726, No 11; Servian, Vuk, I, Nos 290, 291;
Bulgarian, Dozon, p. 98, No 61; Polish, Kolberg, Lud, 1857, I,
151, 12<sup>a</sup>. Again, man is saved by maid: Little-Russian,
Golovatsky, I, 114, No 28; Waclaw z Oleska, p. 226. (W.W.)</p>
