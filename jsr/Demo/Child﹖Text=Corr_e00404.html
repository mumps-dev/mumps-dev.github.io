<h3>4. Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight</h3>


<p>P. 24 a. A copy in Christie's Traditional Ballad Airs, II,
236, 'May Colvine and Fause Sir John' (of which no account is
given), is a free compilation from <b>D</b> <b>b</b>, <b>D</b>
<b>a</b>, and <b>C</b> <b>c</b>.</p>

<p>The Gaelic tale referred to by Jamieson may be seen, as Mr.
Macmath has pointed out to me, in Rev. Alexander Stewart's 'Twixt
Ben Nevis and Glencoe, Edinburgh, 1885, p. 205 ff. Dr. Stewart
gives nine stanzas of a Gaelic ballad, and furnishes an English
rendering. The story has no connection with that of No 4.</p>

<p>25 b, note. 'Halewyn en het kleyne Kind,' in the first volume
of the Manuscript Po&eacute;sies pop. de la France, was
communicated by Crussemaker, and is the same piece that he
printed. Other copies in Lootens et Feys, No 45, p. 85 (see p.
296); Volkskunde, II, 194, 'Van Mijnheerken van
Bruindergestem.'</p>

<p>27 a, note &#8224; (#10). Add: Mac Inness, Folk and Hero Tales
[Gaelic], p. 301, a Highland St. George: see 1, 487, note.</p>

<p>27 f. Professor Bugge, Arkiv f&ouml;r nordisk Filologi, VII,
120-36, 1891, points out that a Swedish ballad given in
Grundtvig, D. g. F. IV, 813 f., <b>F</b>, and here referred to
under '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_41.html">Hind Etin</a>,' I, 364 b, as Swedish <b>C</b>, has
resemblances with 'Kvindemorderen.' Fru Malin is combing her hair
<i>al fresco</i>, when a suitor enters her premises; he remarks
that a crown would sit well on her head. The lady skips off to
her chamber, and exclaims, Christ grant he may wish to be mine!
The suitor follows her, and asks, Where is the fair dame who
wishes to be mine? But when Fru Malin comes to table she is in
trouble, and the suitor puts her several leading questions. She
is sad, not for any of several reasons suggested, but for the
bridge under which her seven sisters (syskon) lie. 'Sorrow not,'
he says, 'we shall build the bridge so broad and long that
four-and-twenty horses may go over at a time.' They pass through
a wood; on the bridge her horse stumbles, and she is thrown into
the water. She cries for help; she will give him her gold crown.
He cares nothing for the crown, and never will help her out.
Bugge maintains that this ballad is not, as Grundtvig considered
it, a compound of 'Nokkens Svig' and 'Harpens Kraft,' but an
independent ballad, 'The Bride Drowned,' of a set to which belong
'Der Wasserman,' Haupt and Schmaler, I, 62, No 34, and many
German ballads: see Grundtvig, IV, 810 f, and here I, 365 f.,
38.</p>

<p>29-37, 486 a. Add: <b>EE</b>, Hruschka u. Toischer,
Deutsche Volkslieder aus B&ouml;hmen, p. 126, No 35. Like
<b>Q</b>, p. 35.</p>

<p>39 ff. The Polish ballad 'J&aacute;s i Kasia.' Mr. John
Kar&#322;owicz has given, in Wis&#322;a, IV, 393-424, the results
of a study of this ballad, and they are here briefly
summarized.</p>

<p>Ten unprinted versions are there added to the large number
already published, making about ninety copies, if fragments are
counted. Copies not noted at I, 39, 486, are, besides these ten,
the following. Kolberg, Krakowskie, II, 111, 168, Nos 208, 336;
Kieleckie, II, 148, No 453; L&#281;czychie, p. 131, No 223;
Lubelskie, I, 289 ff., Nos 473, 474; Pozna&#324;skie, IV, 63, No
131; Mazowsze, III, 274, No 386, IV, 320, No 346. Zbi&oacute;r
wiadomo&#347;ci do antropologii krajowej, II, 78, Nos 89, 90; IV,
129; X, 123. Wis&#322;a, II, 132, 159. Prace filologiczne, II,
568. Ketrzy&#324;ski, O Mazurach, p. 35, No 1. Zawili&#324;ski, Z
powie&#347;ci i pie&#347;ni g&oacute;rali beskidowych, p. 88, No
66. Wasilewski, Jagodne, etc., No 120. Federowski, Lud okolic
&#379;arek, etc., p. 102, No 49.</p>

<p>Most of the ten versions printed in Wis&#322;a agree with
others previously published; in some there are novel details. In
No 3, p. 398, Kasia, thrown into the water by her lover, is
rescued by her brother. In No 10, p. 404, J&aacute;s, when
drowning the girl, tells her that he has drowned four already,
and she shall be the fifth; her brother comes sliding down a
silken rope; fishermen take the girl out dead. There are still
only two of all the Polish versions in which Catharine kills
John, <b>A</b> <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>. The name Ligar, in the latter,
points clearly, Mr. Kar&#322;owicz remarks, to the U-linger, Ad-elger,
Ol-legehr of the German versions, and he is convinced that the
ballad came into Poland from Germany, although the girl is not
drowned in the German ballad, as in the Polish, English, and
French.</p>

<p>John, who is commonly the hero in the Polish ballad, is at the
beginning of many copies declared to have sung, and the words
have no apparent sense. But we observe that in the versions of
western Europe the hero plays on the horn, sings a seductive
song, promises to teach the girl to sing, etc.; the unmeaning
Polish phrase is therefore a survival.</p>

<p>In many of the German versions a bird warns the maid of her
danger. This feature is found once only in Polish: in
Zawili&#324;ski (No 69 A of Kar&#322;owicz).</p>

<p>At p. 777 of Su&#353;il's Moravian Songs there are two other
versions which I have not noticed, the second of them manifestly
derived from Poland.</p>

<p>There is a Little-Russian ballad which begins like the Polish
'J&aacute;s i Kasia,' but ends with the girl being tied to a tree
and burned, instead of being drowned: Wis&#322;a, IV, 423, from
Zbi&oacute;r wiadom. do antrop., III, 150, No 17. Traces of the
incident of the burning are also found in Polish and Moravian
songs: Wis&#322;a, pp. 418-22. It is probable that there were two
independent ballads, and that these have been confounded.</p>

<p>42 a, III, 497 a. <b>A</b>. Add: 'Renaud et ses Femmes,' 
Revue des Traditions Populaires, VI, 34.</p>

<p>43 a. 'Lou Cros d&eacute; Proucinello,' Daymard, Vieux Chants p.
recueillis en Quercy, p. 130, has at the end two traits of this
ballad. A young man carries off a girl whom he has been in love
with seven years; he throws her into a ravine; as she falls, she
catches at a tree; he cuts it away; she cries, What shall I do
with my pretty gowns? and is answered, Give them to me for
another mistress. Cf. also Daymard, p. 128.</p>

<p>43 b, III, 497 a. 'La Fille de Saint-Martin.' Add: 'Le Mari
Assassin,' Chanson du pays de Caux, Revue des Traditions
Populaires, IV, 133.</p>

<p>43 f., 488 a, III, 497. <b>Italian</b>. The ballad in
Nannarelli (488 a) I have seen: it is like 'La Monferrina
incontaminata.' Add: 'La bella Inglese,' Salvadori, in Giornale
di Filologia Romanza, II, 201; 'Un' eroina,' A. Giannini, Canzoni
del Contado di Massa Lunense, No 1, Archivio, VIII, 273;
['Montiglia'], ['Inglesa'], Bolognini, Annuario degli Alpinisti
Tridentini, XIII, Usi e Costumi del Trentino, 1888, p. 37 f.</p>

<p>44 b. 'La Princesa Isabel,' Pidal, Romancero Asturiano, p. 350
(sung by children as an accompaniment to a game), is a variety of
'Rico Franco.'</p>

<p>45 a, 488 a. Another Portuguese version, 'O caso de D. Ignez,'
Braga, Amplia&ccedil;&otilde;es ao Romanceiro das Ilhas dos
A&ccedil;ores, Revista Lusitana, I, 103.</p>

<p>45 b. Breton, 5. Marivonnic also in Quellien, Chansons et
Danses des Bretons, 1889, p. 99.</p>

<p>50 b, note || (#59). As to this use of blood, cf. H. von
Wlis&#322;ocki, Volksth&uuml;mliches zum Armen Heinrich, Ztschr.
f. deutsche Philologie, 1890, XXIII, 217 ff; Notes and Queries,
7th Series, VIII, 363. (G.L.K.)</p>

<p>55. <b>B</b>. A copy in Walks near Edinburgh, by Margaret
Warrender, 1890, p. 104, differs from <b>B</b> <b>b</b> in only a
few words, as any ordinary recollection would. As:</p>

<p>56 ff., 488 f., II, 497 f.</p>

<p>The copy of 'May Collin' which follows is quite the best of
the series <b>C</b>-<b>G</b>. It is written on the same sheet of
paper as the "copy of some antiquity" used by Scott in making up
his 'Gay Goss Hawk' (ed. 1802, II, 7). The sheet is perhaps as
old as any in the volume in which it occurs, but may possibly not
be the original. 'May Collin' is not in the same hand as the
other ballad.</p>

<p>According to the preface to a stall-copy spoken of by
Motherwell, Minstrelsy, p. lxx, 24, "the treacherous and
murder-minting lover was an ecclesiastic of the monastery of
Maybole," and the preface to <b>D</b> <b>d</b> (see I, 488) makes
him a Dominican friar. So, if we were to accept these guides, the
'Sir' would be the old ecclesiastical title and equivalent to the
'Mess' of the copy now to be given.</p>

No 146, Abbotsford.</p>
