<h3>110. The Knight and the Shepherd's Daughter</h3>


<p>P. 457 a, 476 f. <b>A</b>. <b>b</b> is printed in the Ballad
Society's ed. of the Roxburghe Ballads, III, 449. It is in the
Crawford collection, No 1142. There are four copies in the Douce
collection: I, 11 b, 14, 21 b, IV, 33, two of Charles II.'s time,
two of no account (Chappell).</p>

<p>458 b. The Danish ballad is now No 314 of Danmarks gamle
Folkeviser, continued by Axel Olrik, V, II, 377, 'Ebbe Galt
&mdash; Hr. Tidemand.' There are four Danish versions,
<b>A</b>-<b>D</b>, some of the sixteenth century; a
F&auml;r&ouml;e version in five copies, 'Ebbin kall,'
F&oslash;royjakv&aelig;&eth;i, as elaborated by Grundtvig and
Bloch, No 123, D. g. F., <b>E</b>; an Icelandic version,
'S&iacute;monar kv&aelig;&eth;i,' &Iacute;slenzk
Fornkv&aelig;&eth;i, I, 224, No 26. Danish <b>C</b>, Vedel, III,
No 17, is compounded of <b>B</b> and a lost version which must
have resembled <b>A</b>. The copy in Danske Viser, Abrahamson, No
63, is recompounded from <b>C</b> and one of the varieties of
<b>D</b>. Herr Tidemand is the offending knight in <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>; Ebbe Galt in <b>B</b>, <b>D</b> and the F&auml;r&ouml;e
<b>E</b>; K&oacute;ng S&iacute;mon in the Icelandic version.
<b>A</b> has fifteen stanzas, <b>B</b> only eleven; the story is
extended to sixty-seven in <b>D</b>. <b>A</b> begins directly
with a complaint on the part of the injured husband before the
King's Bench; the husband in this version is of a higher class
than in the others, &mdash; Herr Peder, and not a peasant. The
forcing is done at the woman's house in <b>A</b> and the
Icelandic version; in <b>B</b>-<b>E</b> in a wood. In all, the
ravisher is capitally punished.</p>

<p>Hr. Olrik is disposed to think 'The Knight and the Shepherd's
Daughter' a not very happy patching together of 'Ebbe Galt,' a
lost ballad, and 'T&aelig;rningspillet,' D. g. F., No 248, by a
minstrel who may perhaps have had Chaucer's story in mind. I am
not prepared to go further than to admit that there is a gross
inconsistency, even absurdity, in the English ballad; the
shepherd's daughter of the beginning could not possibly turn out
a duke's, an earl's, or a king's daughter in the conclusion.</p>

<p>'Malfred og Sallemand,' p. 458, note, which has many verses in
common with 'Ebbe Galt,' is now No 313 of Danmarks gamle
Folkeviser, V, II, 367.</p>

Minstrelsy," No 81, Abbotsford; in the handwriting of James Skene
