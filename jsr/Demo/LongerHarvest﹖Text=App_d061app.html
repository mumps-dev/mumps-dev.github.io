<h3>Sir Cawline</h3>


<h3>Appendix</h3>

<p>The first of the following pieces is described as having been
learned by Mrs. Harris, in Perthshire, about 1790, transmitted by
recitation to her daughter, and written down from recollection in
1859. No account is given of the derivation of the other. Both
make the princess marry Sir Colvin after his victory on the
elritch hill, rejecting Percy's pathetic conclusion. Neither
retains much of the phraseology of Percy's manuscript, and neither
shows those traces of Percy's phraseology which would demonstrate
its parentage. The first, though the style is stale enough, has
not the decidedly stall-copy stamp of the other. It undoubtedly
has passed through a succession of mouths (as is shown by the
change of leech to match in 3<sup>2</sup>), but we may doubt
whether the other was ever sung or said. 8<sup>4</sup>, in the
Harris version,</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Sin the first nicht that I was born,</td></tr>

</table>

<p>is close to the Percy manuscript, 17<sup>4</sup>,</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Since the day that I was borne,</td></tr>

</table>

<p>where Percy's Reliques has,</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>But he did him scath and scorne.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>In the old manuscript, when Sir Cawline cuts off the elritch
knight's hand, the hand flies over the knight's head and falls
down on that lay land; in Buchan, 25, 26, the hand also flies
into the sky and lights on the ground; but Percy says merely that
the knight fell on that lay land. So that there is one case in
each of agreement with the Percy manuscript where the Reliques
depart from it. It may also be urged that Buchan,
22<sup>1,2</sup>,</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>To trouble any Christian one<br/>
Lives in the righteous law,</td></tr>

</table>

<p>is nearer to what we find in the manuscript, st. 25,</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>And to meete noe man of middle-earth<br/>
And that liues (= 'lieves) on Christs his lay,</td></tr>

</table>

<p>than Percy's,</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>That thou wilt believe on Christ his laye,<br/>
And thereto plight thy hand;<br/>
<br/>
And that thou never on Eldridge come.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Were there anything characteristic or otherwise remarkable in
the passages where there is agreement with the Percy manuscript
and divergence from the Reliques, even one case of such agreement
could not be lightly set aside.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d061app_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> But such agreements as these
are not significant enough to offset the general character of the
Scottish ballads, which is not that of a traditional waif, but of
a fabrication of recent times. It is most likely that the Harris
ballad was put together by some one who was imperfectly
acquainted with the copy in the Reliques. Whether Buchan's ballad
was formed upon some copy of the Harris version it is not worth
the while to ask.</p>
