<p><b>A</b> was No 2 of the fifteen ballads in William Tytler's
lost Brown Manuscript: Nichols's Illustrations, VII, 176. There
is a copy of <b>A</b> in the Abbotsford Manuscript, "Scottish
Songs," fol. 24, with many wilful alterations and a few readings
from tradition. The ballad printed in Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p.
204, is a compound of <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, and the one
in Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads, p. 77, is made up from
<b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, "recited versions obtained in the north and
west" of Scotland, with some slight changes.</p>

<p>The story of 'Willie o Winsbury,' No 100, has considerable
resemblance to that of 'Johnie Scot,' but Willie's extreme beauty
moves the king, the lady's father, to offer his daughter to him
in marriage, without a combat. Mrs. Brown's version of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_101.html">Willie o Douglas Dale</a>,'
No 101, <b>A</b>, begins with the first stanza of
her version of 'Johnie Scot,' <b>A</b>. So does 'Young Betrice,'
another ballad of hers, No 5 of William Tytler's Manuscript:</p>

<p>Young Betrice was as brave a knight<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As ever saild the sea,<br/>
And he 's taen him to the court of France,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To serve for meat and fee.</p>

<p>Anderson, who cites this stanza, Nichols's Illustrations, as
above, remarks: "The conduct of the story is different from that
of No 2 ['Jack, the Little Scot'], which it resembles. Some of
the lines are in 'Gil Morrice.'" 'Young Betrice' may possibly be
a variety of 'Hugh Spencer:' see 'Hugh Spencer,' <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>There is resemblance to '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_83.html">Child Maurice</a>,' No 83, besides the
commonplace of the messenger-boy, in the sending of a token to
the lady, <b>A</b> 12, 13, <b>D</b> 6, <b>B</b> 2, <b>H</b> 4, 5,
<b>J</b> 4, <b>M</b> 8, <b>N</b> 11, 12; '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_83.html">Child Maurice</a>,'
<b>A</b> 7, 8, <b>B</b> 3, 4, <b>C</b> 3, 4, 5, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b> 6, 7, <b>F</b> 17, 18. In the present ballad the token
is a sark of silk (<b>M</b> 8, simply shirt); so in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_83.html">Child Maurice</a>,'
<b>D</b> 7, <b>F</b> 18. The blessing on the
errand-boy, <b>A</b> 8, is found in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_91.html">Fair Mary of Wallington</a>,' No
91, <b>B</b> 9.</p>

<p>While John, the Scot, is in service at the English court, the
king's daughter becomes with child to him. She is thrown into
prison. Johnie, who has fled to Scotland, sends a messenger to
her with a token which she will recognize, urging her to come to
him. An answer is returned that she is in chains. Johnie resolves
to go to the rescue. He is warned of the danger, but a body of
Scots attends him, five hundred men, <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>, <b>O</b>,
twenty-four, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>; all unmarried,
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>,
<b>O</b>. When he arrives at the English court, the king asks his
name. His name is Pitnachton, <b>A</b> 26; McNaughtan, <b>B</b>
17, <b>B</b> 14, cf. <b>C</b> 16; Auchney, <b>H</b> 21; Buneftan,
<b>I</b> 14; Jolinie Scot, Love John, <b>C</b> 17, <b>K</b> 12,
<b>L</b> 13, <b>N</b> 26; Earl Hector, <b>D</b> 18. The king will
hang the Scot on his daughter's account. Resistance is threatened
by Johnie's friends. The king has a champion who will fight them
three by three, <b>A</b> 29, <b>B</b> 20, <b>E</b> 18, <b>F</b>
17, <b>N</b> 30. This champion is an Italian, <b>A</b> 29,
<b>I</b> 17, <b>L</b> 16, <b>N</b> 31, <b>O</b> 8; an Itilian,
<b>H</b> 27; Talliant, Tailliant, <b>C</b> 22, <b>D</b> 23,
<b>F</b> 17, <b>G</b> 16. The Scot kills the Italian in a duel.
In <b>C</b> 24, <b>D</b> 25, <b>F</b> 19, <b>G</b> 18, the
Italian jumps over Johnie's head, skims over it like a swallow,
and is apparently run through while so doing. Johnie calls for a
priest to marry his love and him, the king for a clerk to write
the tocher. But tocher is refused by the Scot, who wants only his
dearly won lady.</p>

<p>The champion is described in <b>A</b> 31 as a gurious
(grugous, gruous?) ghost; in <b>H</b> 27 as a greecy (frightful)
ghost; in <b>L</b> 18 he is a fearsome sight, with three
women's-spans between his brows and three yards between his
shoulders; in the Abbotsford copy of <b>A</b>, 29, 30, a grisly
sight, with a span between his eyes, between his shoulders three
and three, and Johnie scarcely reaching his knee. These points
are probably taken from another and a later ballad, which is
perhaps an imitation, and might almost be called a parody, of
Johnie Scot, 'Lang Johnny Moir:' see Buchan's Ballads of the
North of Scotland, I, 248.</p>

<p>The process of striping a sword oer a stane or to the stran,
<b>N</b> 28, <b>H</b> 28, striking it across the plain, <b>A</b>
32, <b>K</b> 14, is that of whetting or wiping, already noted
under No 81, II, 243 f. To the places cited there may be added
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_83.html">Child Maurice</a>,' <b>F</b> 30, '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_90.html">Jellon Grame</a>,'
No 90, <b>B</b> 8,
21, <b>C</b> 14, '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_112.html">The Baffled Knight</a>,' No 112, <b>A</b> 10.
<b>G</b> 20<sup>2</sup> is a manifest corruption, a repetition of
17<sup>2</sup>; <b>K</b> 14 has been corrected, in conformity
with <b>A</b> 32.</p>

<p>The Rev. Andrew Hall, in his Interesting Roman Antiquities
recently discovered in Fife, 1823, p. 216, relates the following
story, on traditional authority.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d099_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> James Macgill, of Lindores,
had killed Sir Robert Balfour, of Denmiln, in a duel which he had
wished to avoid, about the year 1679. Macgill "immediately went
up to London in order to procure his pardon, which it seems the
king, Charles the Second, offered to grant him upon condition of
his fighting an Italian gladiator or bravo, or, as he was then
called, a bully; which, it is said, none could be found to do...
Accordingly a large stage was erected for the exhibition before
the king and court... Sir James, it is said, stood on the
defensive till the bully had spent himself a little, being a
taller man than Sir James. In his mighty gasconading and
bravadoing he actually leaped over the knight as if he would
swallow him alive, but in attempting to do this a second time Sir
James run his sword up through him, and then called out, 'I have
spitted him; let them roast him who will.' This not only procured
his pardon, but he was also knighted on the spot."</p>

<p>The exploit of Johnie Scot, and, if you please, of Sir James
Macgill, has been achieved as well on the south side of the
English Channel. The Breton seigneur Les Aubrays, or
Lizandr&eacute;, of St. Brieux, is ordered by the French king to
undertake a combat with his wild Moor. Les Aubrays asks a page,
who brings the king's command, about the Moor's fashion of
fighting. The Moor is master of devilish magic, and has herbs
about him by virtue of which any wounds he may get are soon
healed. The Breton is told, among other things, that he must
throw holy water at the Moor the moment the savage draws, and
when the Moor makes a leap in the air he must receive him on the
point of his sword. These instructions are followed with perfect
success. When the Moor is "swimming" in the air, Lizandr&eacute;
so disposes his sword as to take him on it. Luzel, 'Lezobre,'
etc., 'Les Aubrays et le More du Roi,' second and third versions,
I, 300-03, 294, 295; 'Le G&eacute;ant Lizandr&eacute;' II,
568-71, 'Le G&eacute;ant Les Aubrays,' 57679; Po&eacute;sies
populaires de la France, Manuscript, vol. i, near the beginning.
Though the brave Breton is called giant in the title of Luzel's
last two versions, nothing is said in the ballads of his being of
unusual proportions. He is victorious in nineteen fights, but it
is because of his profuse liberal ity to St Anne; it borders on
the irreligious, therefore, to call him a giant.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d099_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
