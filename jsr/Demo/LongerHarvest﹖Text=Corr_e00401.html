<h3>4. Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight</h3>

<p>P. 22 b. <b>D</b>. Add: <b>d</b>. 'The historical ballad of
May Culzean,' an undated stall-copy.</p>

<p>26 b. Another Dutch version (Frisian), spirited, but with
gaps, is given by Dykstra and van der Meulen, In Doaze fol aide
Snypsnaren, Frjentsjer, 1882, p. 118, 'Jan Alberts,' 66 vv.
(K&ouml;hler.)</p>

<p><b>D</b>. Jan Alberts sings a song, and those that hear it
know it not. It is heard by a king's daughter, who asks her
mother's leave to go out for a walk, and is told that it is all
one where she goes or stays, if she keeps her honor. Her father
says the same, when she applies for his leave. She goes to her
bedroom and dresses herself finely, dons a gold crown, puts her
head out of the window, and cries, Now am I Jan Alberts' bride.
Jan Alberts takes her on his horse; they ride fast and long, with
nothing to eat or drink for three days. She then asks Jan why he
gives her nothing, and he answers that he shall ride to the high
tree where hang fourteen fair maids. Arrived there, he gives her
the choice of tree, sword, or water. She chooses the sword, bids
him spare his coat, for a pure maid's blood goes far, and before
his coat is half off his head lies behind him. The head cries,
Behind the bush is a pot of grease; smear my neck with it. She
will not smear from a murderer's pot, nor blow in a murderer's
horn. She mounts his horse, and rides far and long. Jan Alberts'
mother comes to meet her, and asks after him. She says he is not
far off, and is sporting with fourteen maids. Had you told me
this before, I would have laid you in the water, says the mother.
The maid rides on till she comes to her father's gate. Then she
cries to her father to open, for his youngest daughter is
without. The father not bestirring himself, she swims the moat,
and, the door not being open, goes through the glass. The next
day she dries her clothes.</p>

<p>30 a, 37 a. There is a Low German version of the first class,
<b>A</b>-<b>F</b>, in Spee, Volksth&uuml;mliches vom Niederrhein,
K&ouml;ln, 1875, Zweites Heft, p. 3, 'Sch&ouml;ndili,' 50 vv.
(K&ouml;hler.)</p>

<p><b>AA</b>. Sch&ouml;ndili's parents died when she was a child.
Sch&ouml;n-Albert, knowing this, rides to her. She attires
herself in silk, with a gold crown on her hair, and he swings her
on to his horse. They ride three days and nights, with nothing to
eat or drink. She asks whether it is not meal-time; he replies
that they are coming to a linden, where they will eat and drink.
Seven women are hanging on the tree. He gives her the wale of
tree, river, and sword. She chooses the sword; would be loath to
spot his coat; whips off his head before the coat is half off.
The head says there is a pipe in the saddle; she thinks no good
can come of playing a murderer's pipe. She meets first the
father, then the mother; they think that must be
Sch&ouml;n-Albert's horse. That may be, she says; I have not seen
him since yesterday. She sets the pipe to her mouth, when she
reaches her father's gate, and the murderers come like hares on
the wind.</p>

<p><b>BB</b>. Alfred M&uuml;ller, Volkslieder aus dem Erzgebirge,
p. 92, 'Sch&ouml;n Ulrich' [und Trautendelein], 36 vv.
(K&ouml;hler.) Like <b>T</b>, without the song.</p>

<p><b>CC</b>. A. Schl&ouml;sser, Deutsche Volkslieder aus
Steiermark, 1881, p. 338, No 309, 'Der Ritter und die Maid.'
(K&ouml;hler: not yet seen by me.)</p>

<p><b>DD</b>. Curt M&uuml;ndel, Els&auml;ssische Volkslieder, p.
12, No 10, a fragment of fifteen verses. As Anna sits by the
Rhine combing her hair, Heinrich comes along on his horse, sees
her weep, and asks why. It is not for gold and not for goods, but
because she is to die that day. Heinrich draws his sword, runs her
through, and rides home. He is asked why his sword is red, and
says he has killed two doves. They say the dove must be Anna.</p>

<p>32 b. <b>H</b>, line 10. Read: umbrunnen.</p>

<p>39 a, line 1. Read: contributed by Hoffmann.</p>

<p>39 a, third paragraph. Koz&#322;owski, Lud, p. 54, No 15, furnishes
a second and inferior but still important form of <b>A</b>
(Masovian).</p>

<p><b>A</b> b. Ligar (afterwards Jasia, Golo) bids Kasia take all
she has. She has already done this, and is ready to range the
world with him. Suddenly she asks, after they have been some time
on their way, What is that yonder so green? Jasia replies, Our
house, to which we are going. They go on further, and Kasia again
inquires abruptly, What is that yonder so white? "That is my
eight wives, and you shall he the ninth: you are to die, and will
be the tenth." "Where is the gold, the maidens' gold?" "In the
linden, Kasia, in the linden; plenty of it." "Let me not die so
wretchedly; let me draw your sword for once." She drew the sword,
and with one stroke Jasia's head was off.</p>

<p>39 b. To the Polish versions are further to be added:
<b>NN</b>, Piosnki wie&#347;niacze. znad Dzwiny, p. 41, No 51;
<b>OO</b>, Roger, p. 78, No 138; <b>PP</b>, Roger, p. 69, No 125;
<b>QQ</b>, ib., p. 79, No 140; <b>RR</b>, p. 81, No 142;
<b>SS</b>, p. 79, No 139. The last three are imperfect, and
<b>QQ</b>, <b>RR</b>, have a beginning which belongs elsewhere.
Jasia suggests to Kasia to get the key of the new room from her
mother by pretending headache, and bids her take gold enough,
<b>NN</b>, <b>OO</b>. They go off while her mother thinks that
Kasia is sleeping, <b>NN</b>, <b>OO</b>, <b>QQ</b>. They come to
a wood, <b>NN</b>, <b>PP</b> (which is corrupt here), <b>SS</b>;
first or last, to a deep stream, <b>NN</b>, <b>OO</b>, <b>QQ</b>,
<b>SS</b>; it is red sea in <b>RR</b>, as in <b>J</b>. Jasia bids
Kasia return to her mother, <b>NN</b> (twice), <b>RR</b>; bids
her take off her rich clothes, <b>OO</b>, to which she answers
that she has not come here for that. John throws her into the
water, <b>NN</b>, <b>OO</b>, <b>QQ</b>, <b>SS</b>, from a bridge
in the second and third. Her apron catches on a stake or post;
she begs John for help, and gets for answer, ... I did not throw
you in to help you: you may go to the bottom," <b>OO</b>. She
swims to a stake, to which she clings, and John hews her in
three, <b>QQ</b>. Fishermen draw out the body, and carry it to
the church, <b>NN</b>, <b>OO</b>. She apostrophizes her hair in
<b>QQ</b>, <b>SS</b>, as in <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, and in
the same absurd terms in <b>QQ</b> as in <b>J</b>. John is
pursued and cut to pieces in <b>OO</b>, <i>also</i> broken on the wheel.
<b>PP</b> closely resembles German ballads of the third class.
Katie shouts three times: at her first cry the grass curls up; at
the second the river overflows; the third wakes her mother, who
rouses her sons, saying, Katie is calling in the wood. They find
John with a bloody sword; he says he has killed a dove. They
answer, No dove, but our sister, and maltreat him till he tells
what he has done with his victim: "I have hidden her under the
yew-bush; now put me on the wheel."</p>

<p>39 b, line 13 of the middle paragraph. Read Piosnki for
Pie&#347;ni, and omit the quotation marks in this and tbe line
before.</p>

<p>40 b, line 2 (the girl's adding her hair to lengthen the
cord). In the tale of the Sea-horse, Schiefner, Awarische Texte,
Memoirs of the St. Petersburg Academy, vol. XIX, No 6, p. 11 f, a
sixty-ell rope being required to rescue a prince from a well into
which be had been thrown, and no rope forthcoming, the daughter
of a sea-king makes a rope of the required length with her hair,
and with this the prince is drawn out. Dr. Reinhold K&ouml;hler,
who pointed out this incident to me, refers in his notes to the
texts, at p. vii f, to the song of S&uuml;d&auml;i
M&auml;rg&auml;n, Radloff, II, 627-31, where S&uuml;d&auml;i
M&auml;rg&auml;n's wife, having to rescue her husband from a pit,
tries first his horse's tail, and finds it too short, then her
hair, which proves also a little short. A maid is then found
whose hair is a hundred fathoms long, and her hair being tied on
to the horse's tail, and horse, wife, and maid pulling together,
the hero is drawn out. For climbing up by a maid's hair, see,
further, K&ouml;hler's note to Gonzenbach, No 53, II, 236.</p>

<p>40 b, line 7. A message is sent to a father by a daughter in
the same way, in Chodzko, Les Chants historiques de l'Ukraine, p.
75; cf. p. 92, of the same. Tristram sends messages to Isonde hy
linden shavings inscribed with runes: Sir Tristrem, ed.
K&ouml;lbing, p. 56, st. 187; Tristrams Saga, cap. 54, p. 68, ed.
K&ouml;lbing; Gottfried von Strassburg, vv 14427-441.</p>

<p>40 b, line 36. For <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, read <b>G</b>, 
<b>J</b>.</p>

<p>40, note &#8224;. In a Ruthenian ballad a girl who runs away
from her mother with a lover tells her brothers, who have come in
search of her, I did not leave home to go back again with you:
Golovatsky, Part I, p. 77, No 32; Part III, I, p. 17, No 4, p.
18, No 5. So, "I have not poisoned you to help you," Part I, p.
206, No 32, p. 207, No 33.</p>

<p>41 a, second paragraph. Golovatsky, at I, 116, No 29, has a
ballad, found elsewhere without the feature here to be noticed,
in which a Cossack, who is watering his horse while a maid is
drawing water, describes his home as a Wonderland, like John in
Polish <b>Q</b>. "Come to the Ukraine with the Cossacks," he
says. "Our land is not like this: with us the mountains are
golden, the water is mead, the grass is silk; with us the willows
bear pears and the girls go in gold." She yields; they go over
one mountain and another, and when they have crossed the third
the Cossack lets his horse graze. The maid falls to weeping, and
asks the Cossack, Where are yonr golden mountains, where the
water that is mead, the grass that is silk? He answers, No girl
of sense and reason engages herself to a young Cossack. So in
Zegota Pauli, P. 1. ruskiego, p. 29, No 26 = Golovatsky, I, 117,
No 30, where the maid rejoins to the glowing description, I have
ranged the world: golden mountains I never saw; everywhere
mountains are of stone, and everywhere rivers are of water; very
like the girl in Grundtvig, 82 <b>B</b>, st. 7; 183 <b>A</b> 6,
<b>E</b> 5, 6.</p>

<p>41 b, last paragraph. Several Bohemian versions are to be
added to the single example cited from Waldau's B&ouml;hmische
Granaten. This version, which is presumed to have been taken down
by Waldau himself; may be distinguished as <b>A</b>. <b>B</b>,
Susil, Moravsk&eacute; N&aacute;rodn&iacute; P&iacute;sn&#277;,
No 189, p. 191, 'Vrah,' 'The Murderer,' is very like <b>A</b>.
<b>C</b>, Su&#353;il, p. 193. <b>D</b>, Erben,
Prostom&aacute;rodni &#269;esk&eacute; P&iacute;sn&#277; a
&#344;&iacute;kadla, p. 480, No 16, 'Zabit&eacute;
d&#277;v&#269;e,' 'The Murdered Maid.' <b>E</b>, p. 479, No 15,
'Zabit&aacute; sestra,' 'The Murdered Sister.' <b>B</b> has a
double set of names, beginning with Black George, &mdash; not the
Servian, but "king of Hungary," &mdash; and ending with
Indriasch. The maid is once called Annie, otherwise Katie. At her
first call the grass becomes green; at the second the mountain
bows; the third the mother hears. <b>C</b> has marvels of its
own. Anna entreats John to allow her to call to her mother.
"Call, call," he says, " you will not reach her with your call;
in this dark wood, even the birds will not hear you." At her
first call a pine-tree in the forest breaks; at the second the
river overflows; at the third her mother rises from the grave.
She calls to her sons to go to Anna's rescue, and they rise from
their graves. The miscreant John confesses that he has buried
their sister in the wood. They strike off his head, and put a hat
on the head, with an inscription in gold letters, to inform
people what his offence has been. There is a gap after the
seventh stanza of <b>D</b>, which leaves the two following
stanzas unintelligible by themselves: 8, Choose one of the two,
and trust nobody; 9, She made her choice, and shouted three times
towards the mountains. At the first cry the mountain became
green; at the second the mountain bowed backwards; the third the
mother heard. She sent her sons off; they found their neighbor
John, who had cut off their sister's head. The law-abiding, and
therefore modern, young men say that John shall go to prison and
never come out alive. In <b>E</b> the man, a young hunter, says,
Call <i>five</i> times; not even a wood-bird will hear you.
Nothing is said of the first call; the second is heard by the
younger brother, who tells the elder that their sister must be in
trouble. The hunter has a bloody rifle in his hand: how he is
disposed of we are not told. All these ballads but <b>C</b> begin
with the maid cutting grass, and all of them have the dove that
is "no dove, but our sister."</p>

<p>Fragments of this ballad are found, <b>F</b>, in Su&#353;il,
p. 112, No 113, 'Nev&#277;sta ne&#353;t' astnice,' 'The Unhappy
Bride;' <b>G</b>, p. 171, No 171, 'Zbojce,' 'The Murderer;, and
there is a variation from <b>B</b> at p. 192, note 3, which is
worth remarking, <b>H</b>. <b>F</b>, sts 11-14: "Get together
what belongs to you; we will go to a foreign land;" and when they
came to the turf, "Look my head through."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_e00401_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Every hair she
laid aside she wet with a tear. And when they came into the dark
of the wood he cut her into nine [three] pieces. <b>G</b>. Katie
meets John in a meadow; they sit down on the grass. "Look my head
through." She weeps, for she says there is a black fate impending
over her; "a black one for me, a red one for thee." He gets
angry, cuts off her head, and throws her into the river, for
which he is hanged. <b>H</b>. He sprang from his horse, robbed
the maid, and laughed. He set her on the grass, and bade her look
his head through. Every hair she examined she dropped a tear for.
"Why do you weep, Katie? Is it for your crants?" "I am not
weeping for my crants, nor am I afraid of your sword. Let me call
three times, that my father and mother may hear." Compare (German
<b>H</b> 10, 11 <b>Q</b> 8-10, etc. etc.</p>

<p>42 a. These Ruthenian ballads belong with the other Slavic
parallels to No. 4: <b>A</b>. Zagota Pauli; P. 1. ruskiego, p. 21
= Golovatsky, III, I, 149, No 21; <b>B</b>. Golovatsky, III, I,
172, No 46. <b>A</b>. A man induces a girl to go off with him in
the night. They wander over one land and another, and then feel
need of rest. Why does your head ache? he asks of her. Are you
homesick? "My head does not ache; I am not homesick." He takes
her by the white sides and throws her into the deep Donau,
saying, Swim with the stream; we shall not live together. She
swims over the yellow sand, crying, Was I not fair, or was it my
fate? and he dryly answers, Fair; it was thy fate. In <b>B</b> it
is a Jew's daughter that is wiled away. They go in one wagon;
another is laden with boxes [of valuables?] and pillows, a third
with gold pennies. She asks, Where is your house? Over those
hills, he answers. He takes her over a high bridge, and throws
her into the Donau, with, Swim, since you were not acquainted
with our way, our faith!</p>

<p>42 a. <b>A</b>, line 2. Read: Puymaigre.</p>

<p>43 a. <b>D</b>. Add: Po&eacute;sies populaires de la France,
IV, fol. 332, Chanson de l'Aunis, Charente Inf&eacute;rieur; but
even more of the story is lost.</p>

<p>44 a. A ballad in Casetti e Imbriani, C.p. delle Provincie
meridionali, II, 1, begins like 'La Contadina alla Fonte' (see p.
393 a), and ends like 'La Monferrina Incontaminata.' Of the same
class as the last is, I suppose, Nannarelli, Studio comparativo
sui Canti popolari di Arlena, p. 51, No 50 (K&ouml;hler), which I
regret not yet to have seen.</p>

<p>45 a. Portuguese <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, in Alvaro Rodrigues de
Azevedo, Romanceiro do Archipelago da Madeira, p. 57, 'Estoria do
Bravo-Franco,' p. 60, 'Gallo-frango.'</p>

<p>47. A story from Neum&uuml;nster about one G&ouml;rtmicheel, a
famous robber, in M&uuml;llenhoff, p. 37, No 2, blends features
of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_41.html">Hind Etin</a>,' or 'The Maid and the Dwarf-King,' No 41, with
others found in the Magyar ballad, p. 45 f. A handsome wench, who
had been lost seven years, suddenly reappeared at the home of her
parents. She said that she was not at liberty to explain where
she had been, but her mother induced her to reveal this to a
stone near the side-door, and taking up her station behind the
door heard all. She had been carried off by a robber; had lived
with him seven years, and borne him seven children. The robber,
who had otherwise treated her well, had refused to let her visit
her home, but finally had granted her this permission upon her
promising to say nothing about him. When the time arrived for her
daughter to go back, the mother gave her a bag of peas, which she
was to drop one by one along the way. She was kindly received,
but presently the robber thought there was something strange in
her ways. He laid his head in her lap, inviting her to perform
the service so common in like cases. While she was doing this, she
could not but think how the robber had loved her and how he was
about to be betrayed by her, and her remorseful tears dropped on
his face. "So you have told of me!" cried the astute robber,
springing up. He cut off the children's heads and strung them on
a willow-twig before her eyes, and was now coming to her, when
people arrived, under the mother's conduct, who put a stop to his
further revenge, and took their own. See the note,
M&uuml;llenhoff, p. 592 f.</p>
