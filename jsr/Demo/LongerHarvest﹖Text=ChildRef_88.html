<p>Pinkerton inserted Herd's 'Cruel Knight,' <b>A</b>, in his
Select Scotish Ballads, I, 69, with alterations and omissions.
Motherwell enters in his Note-Book, p. 6, that he had received
from Mrs. Gentles, Paisley, 'The Young Johnstone,' "different in
some measure from the copy in Finlay's Ballads." Of the version
printed in his Minstrelsy (<b>B</b> <b>a</b>), undoubtedly that
which was derived from Mrs. Gentles, he says, "for a few verbal
emendations recourse has been had to Mr. Finlay's copy (<b>B</b>
<b>b</b>)." These versions should therefore not have differed
considerably, Finlay suppressed "Young Johnstone's reason for
being sae late a coming in," "as well as a concluding stanza of
inferior merit;" in this rejection he was not followed by
Motherwell. Christie, I, 156, gives <b>E</b> "with some
alterations from the way it was sung" by an old woman; petty
variations, such as one must think could not have impressed
themselves upon a memory unapt to retain things of more
importance. 'Young Johnstone ' in Chambers's Twelve Romantic
Scottish Ballads, p. 19, is made up mostly from <b>B</b>
<b>a</b>, <b>B</b> <b>b</b>, <b>B</b>, like the copy in the same
editor's Scottish Ballads, p. 293, but handles tradition very
freely.</p>

<p><b>B</b> seems to be <b>A</b> altered, or imperfectly
remembered, with the addition of a few stanzas. Motherwell
remarks of his version, what is true of all the others but
<b>B</b>, that the ballad throws no light on Young Johnstone's
motive for stabbing his lady. An explanation was afforded by the
reciter: "The barbarous act was committed unwittingly, through
Young Johnstone's suddenly waking from sleep, and, in that moment
of confusion and alarm, unhappily mistaking his mistress for one
of his pursuers." And this is the turn which is given to the act
in <b>B</b> 13:</p>

<p>'Ohon, alas, my lady gay,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To come sae hastilie!<br/>
I thought it was my deadly foe,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ye had trysted into me.'</p>

<p>The apology may go for what it is worth. Awake or waking,
Young Johnstone's first instinct is as duly to stab as a
bull-dog's is to bite.</p>
