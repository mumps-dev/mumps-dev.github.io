<h3>VR is PN</h3>
<p>Value Representation "Person Name"<br/>
A character string encoded using a 5 component
convention. The character code 5CH (the BACKSLASH &quot;\&quot;
in ISO-IR 6) shall not be present, as it is used as the delimiter
between values in multiple valued data elements. The string may
be padded with trailing spaces. The five components in their
order of occurrence are: family name complex, given name complex,
middle name, name prefix, name suffix. Any of the five components
may be an empty string. The component delimiter shall be the
caret &quot;^&quot; character (5EH). Delimiters are required for
interior null components. Trailing null components and their
delimiters may be omitted. Multiple entries are permitted in each
component and are encoded as natural text strings, in the format
preferred by the named person. This conforms to the ANSI HISPP
MSDS Person Name common data type.<br/>
This group of five components
is referred to as a Person Name component group.<br/>
For the purpose
of writing names in ideographic characters and in phonetic
characters, up to 3 groups of components (see Annex H examples 1
and 2) may be used. The delimiter for component groups shall be
the equals character &quot;=&quot; (3DH). The three component
groups of components in their order of occurrence are: a
single-byte character representation, an ideographic
representation, and a phonetic representation.<br/>
Any component
group may be absent, including the first component group. In this
case, the person name may start with one or more &quot;=&quot;
delimiters. Delimiters are required for interior null component
groups. Trailing null component groups and their delimiters may be
omitted.<br/>
Precise semantics are defined for each component group.
See section 6.2.1.<br/>
<b>Examples</b>:<br/>
Rev. John Robert Quincy Adams, B.A. M.Div.<br/>
&quot;Adams^John Robert Quincy^^Rev.^B.A. M.Div.&quot;<br/>
[One family name; three given names; no middle name; one prefix;
two suffixes.]<br/>
Susan Morrison-Jones, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer<br/>
&quot;Morrison-Jones^Susan^^^Ph.D., Chief Executive
Officer&quot;<br/>
[Two family names; one given name; no middle name;
no prefix; two suffixes.]<br/>
John Doe<br/>
&quot;Doe^John&quot;<br/>
[One family name; one given name; no middle name, prefix, or suffix.
Delimiters have been omitted for the three trailing null
components.]<br/>
(For examples of the encoding of Person Names using
multi-byte character sets see Annex H)<br/>
<b>Notes</b><br/>
1. This five
component convention is also used by HL7 as defined in ASTM
E-1238-91 and further specialized by the ANSI MSDS.<br/>
2. In typical
American and European usage the first occurrence of &quot;given
name&quot; would represent the &quot;first name&quot;. The second
and subsequent occurrences of the &quot;given name&quot; would
typically be treated as a middle name(s). The &quot;middle
name&quot; component is retained for the purpose of backward
compatibility with existing standards.<br/>
3. The &quot;Degree&quot;
component present in ASTM E-1238-91 is absorbed into the
&quot;Suffix&quot; component.<br/>
4. The implementor should remain
mindful of earlier usage forms which represented &quot;given
names&quot; as &quot;first&quot; and &quot;middle&quot; and that
translations to and from this previous typical usage may be
required.<br/>
5. For reasons of backward compatibility with versions
of this standard prior to V3.0, person names might be considered
a single family name complex (single component without
&quot;^&quot; delimiters).<br/>
Character Set: Default Character Repertoire and/or as defined by
(0008,0005) excluding Control Characters LF, FF, and CR but
allowing Control Character ESC.<br/>
Size Restriction(s): 64 chars maximum per component group (see NOTE in
6.2)</p><a href="jsrDCMcs%EF%B9%96Term=.html"></a>
