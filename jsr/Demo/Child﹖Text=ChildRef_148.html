<p>Ritson, Robin Hood, II, 110, 1795, "from three old
black-letter copies, one in the collection of Anthony a Wood,
another in the British Museum, and the third in a private
collection." Evans, Old Ballads, 1777, 1784, I, 171, from an
Aldermary garland.</p>

<p>Robin Hood is here made to try his fortunes on the sea, like
Eustace the Monk and Wallace. He goes to Scarborough and gives
himself out as a fisherman, and is engaged as such by a widow
with whom he lodges, who is the owner of a ship. Out of his
wantonness, rather than his ignorance, we must suppose, Simon, as
he calls himself, when others cast baited hooks into the water,
casts in bare lines; for which he is laughed to scorn. A French
cruiser bears down on the fishermen, and the master gives up all
for lost. Simon asks for his bow; not a Frenchman will he spare.
The master, not strangely, takes such talk for brag. Simon
requests to be tied to a mast, 'that at his mark he may stand
fair,' and to have his bow in his hand, when never a Frenchman
will he spare. He shoots one of the enemy through the heart, and
then asks to be loosed and to have his bow in his hand, when,
again, never a Frenchman will he spare. The Englishmen board, and
find a booty of twelve thousand pound. Simon announces that he
shall give half the ship to the dame who employed him, and the
other half to his comrades. The master objects; Simon has won the
vessel with his own hand (a point which might have been made more
distinctly to appear in the narrative), and he shall have her.
But the outlaw afloat has still his munificent old ways; so it
shall be as to the ship, and the twelve thousand pound shall
build an asylum 'for the opprest'! All this may strike us as
infantile, but the ballad was evidently in great favor two
hundred years ago.</p>
