<h3>161. The Battle of Otterburn</h3>


<p>Pp. 294, 520. St. George Our Lady's Knight. 'Swete Sainct
George, our ladies knyght,' Skelton, 'Against the Scottes,' v.
141, Dyce, I, 186; 'Thankyd be Saynte Gorge our ladyes knythe,'
in the 'Ballade of the Scot- tysche Kynge,' p. 95 of the
fac-simile edition by J. Ashton, 1882 (where the passage is
somewhat different). In his note, II, 220, to the poem 'Against
the Scottes,' Dyce remarks that St. George is called Our Lady's
Knight "in a song written about the same time as the present
poem, Cott. Manuscript Domit. A. xviii. fol. 248." This appears
to be the song quoted from the same Manuscript by Sir H. Ellis,
Original Letters, First Series, I, 79:</p>

<p>In his Chorus de Dis, super triumphali victoria contra Gallos,
etc., Skelton speaks of St. George as Gloria Cappadocis
div&aelig; milesque Mari&aelig;, v. 13; Dyce, I, 191. See also
John Anstis, The Register of the Most Noble Order of the Garter,
London, 1724, 1, 122; II, 27, 48 f. (G.L.K.)</p>

<p>299. <b>C</b>. First published in the second edition of the
Minstrelsy, 1803, I, 27. 1<sup>3,4</sup> there read The doughty
earl of Douglas rode Into England, to catch a prey;
31<sup>1</sup>, Yield thee, O yield thee, etc., and
31<sup>3</sup>, Whom to shall I yield, said, etc.</p>

<p>For his later edition of 'The Battle of Otterburn,' Scott says
he used "two copies ... obtained from the recitation of old
persons residing at the head of Ettrick Forest." James Hogg sent
Scott, in a letter dated September 10 (1802?), twenty-nine
stanzas "collected from two different people, a crazy old man and
a woman deranged in her mind," and subsequently recovered, by
"pumping" his "old friends' memory," other lines and half lines
out of which (using the necessary cement, and not a little) he
built up eleven stanzas more, and these he seems to have
forwarded in the same letter. These two communications are what
is described by Scott as two copies. They will be combined here
according to Hogg's directions, and the second set of verses
bracketed for distinction.</p>

<p>The materials out of which <b>C</b> was constructed can now
easily be separated. We must bear in mind that Scott allowed
himself a liberty of alteration; this he did not, however, carry
very far in the present instance. 1-13, 15-19, 23 are taken, with
slight change or none, from Hogg's first "copy" of verses; 24,
26-29 from the second; 30-35 are repeated from Scott's first
edition. 14 is altered from <b>A</b> 16; 20 = Hogg
21<sup>1,2</sup> + Scott; 21 = Hogg 22<sup>1</sup> + Hogg
35<sup>2-4</sup>; 22 = Hogg 23<sup>1,3</sup> + Scott; 25 = Hogg
28<sup>1</sup> + <b>B</b> 8<sup>2-4</sup>. Scott did well to drop
Hogg 9, and ought to have dropped Hogg 8.</p>

<p>Hogg writes:</p>

<p>"As for the scraps of Otterburn which I have got, they seem to
have been some confused jumble, made by some person who had
learned both the songs which you have, and in time had been
straitened to make one out of them both. But you shall have it as
I had it, saving that, as usual, I have sometimes helped the
measure, without altering one original word."</p>

<p>After 24: "This ballad, which I have collected from two
different people, a crazy old man and a woman deranged in her
mind, seems hitherto considerably entire; but now, when it
becomes most interesting, they have both failed me, and I have
been obliged to take much of it in plain prose. However, as none
of them seemed to know anything of the history save what they had
learned from the song, I took it the more kindly. Any few verses
which follow are to me unintelligible.</p>

<p>"He told Sir Hugh that he was dying, and ordered him to
conceal his body, and neither let his own men nor Piercy's know;
which he did, and the battle went on headed by Sir Hugh
Montgomery, and at length" (35, etc.).</p>

<p>After 38: "Piercy seems to have been fighting devilishly in
the dark; indeed, my relaters added no more, but told me that Sir
Hugh died on the field, but that" (40).</p>

<p>In the postscript, Hogg writes:</p>

<p>"Not being able to get the letter away to the post, I have
taken the opportunity of again pumping my old friends' memory,
and have recovered some more lines and half lines of Otterburn,
of which I am become somewhat enamourd. These I have been obliged
to arrange somewhat myself, as you will see below; but so mixed
are they with original lines and sentences that I think, if you
pleased, they might pass without any acknowledgment. Sure no man
will like an old song the worse of being somewhat harmonious.
After [24] you may read [25-34]. Then after [38] read [39]."</p>

<p>Of Almonshire [3<sup>2</sup>] Hogg writes: "Almon shire may
probably be a corruption of Banburgh shire, but as both my
relaters called it so, I thought proper to preserve it."</p>

<p>Andrew Livingston writes to Scott, Airds by Castle Douglas,
28th April, 1806, Letters, I, No 183: "My mother recollects seven
or eight verses of the ballad of 'The Battle of Otterburn'
different from any I have seen either in the first and second
editions of the Minstrelsy or in Percy's Reliques... In several
parts they bear a great resemblance to the copy in the first
edition of the Minstrelsy."</p>
