<h3>The Knight of Liddesdale</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Hume of Godscroft, History of the Houses of Douglas and Angus,
1644, p. 77. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d16001.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>William Douglas, the Knight of Liddesdale, who figures in the
foregoing ballad, was assassinated in 1353, while hunting in
Ettrick forest, by his kinsman and godson, Lord William
Douglas.</p>

<p>According to the Scotichronicon, the motive was said to be
revenge for Alexander Ramsay, one of the first men among the
Scots, whom Liddesdale had assaulted while he was holding a
court, wounded, carried off, and suffered to die by starving; and
for Sir David Berkeley, whom Liddesdale was charged with
procuring to be murdered in 1350, in return for the death of his
brother, Sir John Douglas, brought to pass by Berkeley.
(Scotichronicon, ed. Goodall, II, 348, 335, XIV, 8, XIII, 50,
XIV, 7.)</p>

<p>Hume of Godscroft considers the motive assigned to be quite
unnatural, and at best a pretence. A ballad known to him gave a
different account. "The Lord of Liddesdale, being at his pastime,
hunting in Attrick forest, is beset by William Earle of Douglas,
and such as hee had ordained for that purpose, and there
assailed, wounded, and slain, beside Galsewood, in the yeare
1353; upon a jealousie that the Earle had conceived of him with
his lady, as the report goeth, for so sayes the old song." After
citing the stanza which follows, Hume goes on to say: "The song
also declareth how shee did write her love-letters to Liddisdale,
to disswade him from that hunting. It tells likewise the manner
of the taking of his men, and his owne killing at Galsewood, and
how hee was carried the first night to Lindin Kirk, a mile from
Selkirk, and was buried within the Abbacie of Melrosse."</p>

<p>"The sole basis for this statement of Hume's," says Sir
William Fraser, The Douglas Book, I, 223 f, 1885, "seems to be
the anonymous Border ballad, part of which he quotes, to which he
adds the tradition that the lady wrote to her lover to dissuade
him from that hunting. Apart from the fact that this tradition is
opposed to contemporary history, which states that Sir William
was wholly unsuspicious of danger, the story told by Godscroft is
otherwise erroneous. He assumes that Douglas was made earl in
1346, and that he was married to a daughter of the Earl of March,
neither of which assumptions is true. Douglas was not created
earl until 26th January, 1357-8, and there was therefore no
'Countess of Douglas' to wait for the Knight of Liddesdale.
Douglas's only wife was Lady Margaret of Mar, who survived him.
The exact date of their marriage has not been ascertained, but it
is certain that Douglas had no countess of the family of March in
1353, while it is doubtful if at that date he was married at all.
Popular tradition is therefore at fault in assigning matrimonial
jealousy as a motive for killing the Knight of Liddesdale."</p>

<p>"Some fragments of this ballad are still current, and will be
found in the ensuing work," says Scott, Minstrelsy, I, 221, note,
ed. 1833. It may be that Sir Walter became convinced that these
fragments were not genuine; at any rate, they do not appear in
his collection.</p>
