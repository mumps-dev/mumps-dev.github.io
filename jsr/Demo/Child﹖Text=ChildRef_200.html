<p>The English ballad, though derived from the Scottish, may
perhaps have been printed earlier. A conjectural date of 1720 is
given, with hesitation, to <b>G</b> <b>a</b>, in the catalogue of
the British Museum.</p>

<p>The Scottish ballad appears to have been first printed in the
fourth volume of the Tea-Table Miscellany, 1740, but no copy of
that edition has been recovered. From the Tea-Table Miscellany it
was repeated, with variations, some traditional, some arbitrary,
in: Herd's Ancient and Modern Scots Songs, 1769, 'Gypsie Laddie,'
p. 88, ed. 1776, II, 54; The Fond Mother's Garland, not dated,
but earlier than 1776; Pinkerton's Select Scotish Ballads, 1783,
I, 67; Johnson's Museum, 'Johny Faa, or, The Gypsie Laddie,' No
181, p. 189; Ritson's Scotish Songs, 1794, II, 176; and in this
century, Cromek's Select Scotish Songs, 1810, II, 15;
Cunningham's Songs of Scotland, 1825, II, 175. A tran script in
the Campbell Manuscripts, 'The Gypsies,' I, 16, is from
Pinkerton.</p>

<p>"The people in Ayrshire begin this song,<br/>
'The gypsies cam to my lord Cassilis' yett.'<br/>
They have a great many more stanzas ... than I ever yet saw in
any printed." Burns, in Cromek's Reliques, 1809, p. 161. (So
Sharpe, in the Musical Museum, 1853, IV, 217, but perhaps
repeating Burns.) <b>B</b>, from Galloway, has eight more stanzas
than <b>A</b>, and <b>E</b>, also from Galloway, fourteen more,
but quite eight of the last are entirely untraditional,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d200_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and
the hand of the editor is frequently to be recognized
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Finlay, Scottish Ballads, 1808, II, 39, inserted two stanzas
after A 2, the first of which is nearly the same as 5, and the
second as <b>B</b> 3, <b>C</b> 3. The variations of his text, and
others in his notes, are given under <b>A</b>. Kinloch
Manuscripts, V, 299; Chambers, Scottish Ballads, 1829, p. 143;
Aytoun, 1859, I, 187, repeat Finlay, with a few slight changes.
The Ballads and Songs of Ayrshire, I, 9, follows Chambers.</p>

<p>The copy in Smith's Scotish Minstrel, III, 90, is derived from
<b>B</b> <b>a</b>, but has readings of other texts, and is of no
authority. That in Maidment's Scotish Ballads and Songs, 1868,
II, 185, is <b>B</b> a with changes. Ten stanzas in a manuscript
of Scottish songs and ballads, copied 1840 or 1850 by a
granddaughter of Lord Woodhouselee, p. 46, are from <b>B</b>
<b>a</b>. This may be true also of <b>B</b> <b>b</b>, which,
however, has not Cassilis in 1<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p><b>C</b> is from a little further north, from Renfrewshire; D
from Aberdeenshire. <b>F</b> is from the north of England, and
resembles <b>C</b>. The final stanza of <b>G</b> <b>a</b> is
cited by Ritson, Scotish Songs, II, 177, 1794. 'The Rare Ballad
of Johnnie Faa and the Countess o Cassilis,' Sheldon's Minstrelsy
of the English Border, p. 326, which the editor had "heard sung
repeatedly by Willie Faa," and of which he "endeavored to
preserve as much as recollection would allow," has the eleven
stanzas of the English broadside, and twelve more of which
Sheldon must have been unable to recollect anything.
<b>H</b>-<b>K</b> are all varieties of the broadside.</p>

<p>The Rev. S. Baring-Gould has most obligingly sent me a ballad,
taken down by him from the singing of an illiterate hedger in
North Devon, in which 'The Gypsy Laddie,' recomposed (mostly with
middle rhyme in the third verse, as in <b>A</b> 1, 8), forms the
sequel to a story of an earl marrying a very reluctant gypsy
maid. When the vagrant who has been made a lady against nature
hears some of her tribe singing at the castle-gate, the passion
for a roving life returns, and she deserts her noble partner, who
pursues her, and, not being able to induce her to return to him,
smites her "lily-white" throat with his sword. This little
romance, retouched and repaired, is printed as No 50 of Songs and
Ballads of the West, now publishing by Baring-Gould and Sheppard.
Mr. Baring-Gould has also given me a defective copy of the second
part of 'The Gipsy Countess' (exhibiting many variations), which
he obtained from an old shoemaker of Tiverton.</p>

<p>Among the Percy papers there is a set of ballads made over by
the Bishop, which may have been intended for the contemplated
extension of his Reliques. 'The Gipsie Laddie,' in eighteen
stanzas, and not quite finished, is one of these. After seven
stanzas of <b>A</b>, not much altered, the husband ineffectually
pursues the lady, who adopts the gipsy trade, with her reid cheek
stained wi yallow. Seven years pass, during which the laird has
taken another wife. At Yule a wretched carline begs charity at
his gate, who, upon questioning, reveals that she had been a lady
gay, with a comely marrow, but had proved false and ruined
herself.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Gypsies sing so sweetly at our lord's gate as to
entice his lady to come down; as soon as she shows herself, they
cast the glamour on her (so <b>B</b>-<b>F</b>, <b>G</b>
<b>b</b>). She gives herself over to the chief gypsy, Johny Faa
by name, without reserve of any description. Her lord, upon
returning and finding her gone, sets out to recover her, and
captures and hangs fifteen gypsies. (It is extremely likely that
this version has lost several stanzas.)</p>

<p>Our lord, unnamed in <b>A</b>, is Lord Cassilis in <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>F</b> (so Burns, and Johnson's Museum). Cassilis has
become Cassle, Castle in <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, Corsefield<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d200_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in
<b>D</b>, Cashan in Irish <b>I</b>, Garrick<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d200_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in American
<b>K</b>. The Gypsy Laddie is again Johnie, Jockie, Faa in
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>; but Gipsy Davy in <b>C</b> (where
Lady Cassilis is twice called Jeanie Faw), and in American lab;
and seems to be called both Johnnie Faw and Gypsie Geordie in
<b>F</b>. The lady gives the gypsies the good wheat bread
<b>B</b>, <b>E</b> (beer and wine, Finlay); they give her
(sweetmeats, <b>C</b>) ginger, nutmeg, or both, and she gives
them the ring (rings) off her finger (fingers), <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, (and Finlay).</p>

<p><b>B</b> a has a full story from this point on. The gypsy asks
the lady to go with him, and swears that her lord shall never
come near her. The lady changes her silk mantle for a plaid, and
is ready to travel the world over with the gypsy, <b>B</b>
<b>a</b> 5, <b>A</b> 3, <b>C</b> 4, <b>D</b> 3, <b>E</b> 4,
<b>F</b> 4, (<b>B</b> <b>a</b> 6 is spurious). They wander high
and low till they come to an old barn, and by this time she is
weary. The lady begins to find out what she has undertaken: last
night she lay with her lord in a well-made bed, now she must lie
in an old barn, <b>B</b> <b>a</b> 7, 8, <b>A</b> 4, <b>C</b> 6,
<b>D</b> 7, <b>F</b> 5 (reeky kill <b>E</b> 8, on a straw bed
<b>H</b> 7, in the ash-corner <b>I</b> 6). The gypsy bids her
hold her peace, her lord shall never come near her. They wander
high and low till they come to a wan water, and by this time she
is weary. Oft has she ridden that wan water with her lord; now
she must set in her white feet and wade, <b>B</b> <b>a</b> 11,
<b>C</b> 5, <b>D</b> 5, 6, <b>E</b> 7, (and carry the gipsie
laddie, <b>B</b> <b>a</b> 11, badly; follow, <b>B</b> <b>b</b>).
The lord comes home, is told that his lady is gone off with the
gypsy, and immediately sets out to bring her back (so all). He
finds her at the wan water, <b>B</b> <b>a</b> 14; in Abbey Dale,
drinking wi Gipsey Davy, <b>C</b> 10; near Strabogie, drinking wi
Gypsie Geordie, <b>F</b> 10;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d200_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> by the riverside, <b>J</b>
<b>a</b> 4; at the Misty Mount, <b>K</b> 5, 6. He asks her
tenderly if she will go home, <b>B</b> <b>a</b> 15, <b>E</b> 15,
<b>F</b> 12, he will shut her up so securely that no man shall
come near, <b>B</b> <b>a</b> 15, <b>E</b> 15; he expostulates
with her, more or less reproachfully, <b>C</b> 11, <b>F</b> 11,
<b>G</b> 9, <b>H</b> 5, <b>J</b> 5. She will not go home; as she
has brewed, so will she drink, <b>B</b> <b>a</b> 16, <b>G</b> 10;
she cares not for houses or lands or babes (baby) <b>G</b> 10,
<b>H</b> 6, <b>J</b> 6. But she swears to him that she is as free
of the gypsies as when her mother bare her, <b>B</b> <b>a</b> 17,
<b>E</b> 16.</p>

<p>Fifteen gypsies are hanged, or lose their lives, <b>A</b> 10,
<b>B</b> 18, <b>D</b> 14; sixteen, all sons of one mother,
<b>C</b> 12, 13; seven, <b>F</b> 13, <b>G</b> 11, (cf. <b>I</b>
l).<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d200_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>D</b> 8-11 is ridiculously perverted in the interest of
morals: compare <b>B</b> <b>a</b> 17, <b>E</b> 16. 'I swear that
my hand shall never go near thee,' <b>D</b> 8, is transferred to
the husband in <b>I</b> 5: 'A hand I'll neer lay on you' (in the
way of correction).</p>

<p>In <b>G</b> 4 the lady, in place of exchanging her silk mantle
for a plaidie, pulls off her high-heeled shoes, of Spanish
leather, and puts on Highland brogues. In <b>I</b> 7 gypsies take
off her high-heeled shoes, and she puts on Lowland brogues. The
high-heeled shoes, to be sure, are not adapted to following the
Gypsy Laddie, but light may perhaps be derived from <b>C</b> 12,
where the gypsies 'drink her stockings and her shoon.' In
<b>K</b> these high-heeled shoes of Spanish leather are wrongly
transferred to Lord Garrick in the copy as delivered, but have
been restored to the lady.</p>

<p>It is not said (except in the spurious portions of <b>B</b>)
that the lady was carried back by her husband, but this may
perhaps be inferred from his hanging the gypsies. In <b>D</b> and
<b>K</b> we are left uncertain as to her disposition, which is
elsewhere, for the most part, to stick to the gypsy. <b>J</b>, a
copy of very slight authority, makes the lord marry again within
six months of his wife's elopement.</p>

<p>The earliest edition of the ballad styles the gypsy Johny Faa,
but gives no clew to the fair lady. Johnny Faa was a prominent
and frequent name among the gypsies. Johnne Faw's right and title
as lord and earl of Little Egypt were recognized by James V in a
document under the Privy Seal, February 15, 1540, and we learn
from this paper that, even before this date, letters had been
issued to the king's officers, enjoining them to assist Johnne
Faw "in execution of justice upon his company and folks, conform
to the laws of Egypt, and in punishing of all them that rebels
against him." But in the next year, by an act of the Lords of
Council, June 6, Egyptians are ordered to quit the realm within
thirty days on pain of death, notwithstanding any other letters
or privileges granted them by the king, his grace having
discharged the same. The gypsies were expelled from Scotland by
act of Parliament in 1609. Johnne, alias Willie, Faa, with three
others of the name, remaining notwithstanding, were sentenced to
be hanged, 1611, July 31. In 1615, January 25, a man was delated
for harboring of Egyptians, u specially of Johnne Fall, a
notorious Egyptian and chieftain of that unhappy sort of people."
In 1616, July 24, Johnn&euml; Faa, Egyptian, his son, and two
others were condemned to be hanged for contemptuous repairing to
the country and abiding therein. Finally, in 1624, January 24,
Captain Johnn&euml; Faa and seven others were sentenced to be
hanged for the same offence, and on the follow ing 29th Helen
Faa, relict of the late Captain Johnn&euml; Faa, with ten other
women, was sentenced to be drowned, but execution was stayed.
Eight men were executed, but the rest, "being either children and
of less-age and women with child or giving suck to children,"
were, after imprisonment, banished the country under pain of
death, to be inflicted without further process should they be
found within the kingdom after a day fixed.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d200_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The execution of
the notorious Egyptian and chieftain Johnny Faa must have made a
considerable impression, and it is presumable that this ballad
may have arisen not long after. Whether this were so or not,
Johnny Faa acquired popular fame, and became a personage to whom
any adventure might plausibly be imputed. It is said that he has
even been foisted into 'The Douglas Tragedy' ('<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_7.html">Earl Brand</a>'), and
Scott had a copy of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_178.html">Captain Car</a>' in which, as in <b>F</b>,
<b>G</b>, of that ballad, the scene was transferred to Ayrshire,
and the incendiary was called Johnny Faa.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d200_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Toward the end of the last century we begin to hear that the
people in Ayrshire make the wife of the Earl of Cassilis the
heroine of the ballad. This name, under the instruction of Burns,
was adopted into the copy in Johnson's Museum (which, as to the
rest, is Ramsay's), and in the index to the second volume of the
Museum, 1788, we read, "neighboring tradition strongly vouches
for the truth of this story." After this we get the tradition in
full, of course with con siderable variety in the details, and
sometimes with criticism, sometimes without.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d200_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The main points in the traditional story are that John, sixth
earl of Cassilis, married, for his first wife, Lady Jean
Hamilton, whose affections were preengaged to one Sir John Faa,
of Dunbar. Several years after, when Lady Cassilis had become the
mother of two children,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d200_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Sir John Faa took the opportunity of
the earl's absence from home (while Lord Cassilis was attending
the Westminster Assembly, say some) to present himself at the
castle, accompanied by a band of gypsies and himself disguised as
a gypsy, and induced his old love to elope with him. But the earl
returned in the nick of time, went in pursuit, captured the whole
party, or all but one,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d200_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> who is supposed to tell the story,
and hanged them on the dule tree, "a most umbrageous plane, which
yet flourishes upon a mound in front of the castle gate." The
fugitive wife was banished from board and bed, and confined for
life in a tower at Maybole, built for the purpose. "Eight heads
carved in stone below one of the turrets are said to be the
effigies of so many of the gypsies."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d200_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The ford by which the
lady and her lover crossed the River Doon is still called The
Gypsies' Steps.</p>

<p>Several accounts put the abduction at the time when the Earl
of Cassilis was attending the Assembly of Divines at Westminster.
This was in September, 1643. It is now known that Lady Cassilis
died in December, 1642. What is much more important, it is known
from two letters written by the earl immediately after her death
that nothing could have occurred of a nature to alienate his
affection, for in the one he speaks of her as a "dear friend" and
"beloved yoke-fellow," and in the other as his "dear
bed-fellow."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d200_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"Seldom, when stripped of extraneous matter, has tradition
been better supported than it has been in the case of Johnie Faa
and the Countess of Cassilis: " Maidment, Scotish Ballads, 1868,
II, 184. In a sense not intended, this is quite true; most of the
tradi tions which have grown out of ballads have as slight a
foundation as this. The connection of the ballad with the
Cassilis family (as Mr. Macmath has suggested to me) may possibly
have arisen from the first line of some copy reading, 'The
gypsies came to the castle-gate.' As <b>F</b> 1<sup>3</sup> has
perverted Earl of Cassilis to Earl of Castle, so Castle may have
