<p><b>a</b> seems to have been communicated to Percy by Roger
Halt in 1775. <b>b</b> was contributed to Caw's Museum by John
Elliot of Reidheugh, a gentleman, says Scott, well skilled in the
antiquities of the western border, <b>c</b> was taken down "from
the singing and recitation of a Liddesdale-man, namely, Robert
Shortreed, sheriff-substitute of Roxburghshire, in the autumn of
1816;" but it differs from <b>b</b> in no important respect
except the omission of thirteen stanzas, 17, 18, 24, 32, 35-38,
51, 52, 56-58.</p>

<p>Scott's copy, I, 137, 1802, II, 63, 1833, is <b>c</b> with the
deficient stanzas supplied from <b>b</b>. A copy in the Campbell
Manuscripts, I, 204, is <b>b</b>.</p>

<p>Ritson pointed out to Scott a passage in Nashe's Have with you
to Saffren Walden which shows that this ballad was popular before
the end of the sixteenth century: "Dick of the Cow, that mad
demi-lance northren borderer, who plaied his prizes with the lord
Jockey so bravely," 1596, in Grosart's Nashe, III, 6.</p>

<p>An allusion to it likewise occurs in Parrot's Laquei
Ridiculosi, or Springes for Woodcocks, London, 1613, Epigr.
76.</p>

long in, ride out on the chance of some booty. They come to
Hutton Hall, but find no gear left without by the experienced
laird, except six sheep, which they scorn to take. Johnie asks
Willie who the man was that they last met, and learning that it
was Dick o the Cow, a fool whom he knows to have three as good
kine as are in Cumberland, says, These kine shall go with me to
Liddesdale. They carry off Dick's three kine, and also three
coverlets from his wife's bed. When daylight reveals the theft,
Dick's wife raises a wail; he bids her be still, he will bring
her three cows for one. Dick goes to his master and makes his
loss known, and asks leave to go to Liddesdale to steal; his
troth is required that he will steal from none but those who have
stolen from him. Dickie goes on to Puddingburn, where there are
three and thirty Armstrongs, and complains to the Laird's Jock of
the wrong which Fair Johnie Armstrong and Willie have done him.
Fair Johnie is for hanging Dick, Willie for slaying him, and
another young man for tossing him in a sheet, beating him, and
letting him go. The Laird's Jock, who is a better fellow than the
rest, tells Dick that if he will sit down he shall have a bit of
his own cow. Dick observes that a key has been flung over the
doorhead by lads who have come in late. With this key he opens
the stable where are the Armstrongs' three and thirty horses. He
ties all but three with a triple knot,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d185_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> leaps on one, takes
another in his hand, and makes off. Fair Johnie discovers in the
morning that his own horse and Willie's have been stolen, borrows
the Laird's-Jock's, which Dick (for improvement of the story)
happens not to have tied, arms himself, and sets out in pursuit.
Overtaking Dick on Canoby lee, Johnie sends a spear at him, which
only pierces the innocent's jerkin. Dick turns on Johnie, and has
the good fortune to fell him with the pommel of his sword. He
strips Johnie of armor and sword, takes the third horse, and goes
home to his master, who threatens to hang him for his thieving.
The fool plants himself upon the terms his master had made with
him: he had stolen from none but those that had stolen from him.
His having the Laird Jock's horse requires explanation; but Dick
is able to give such satisfaction on that point that his master
offers twenty pound and one of his best milk-kye for the horse.
Dick exacts and gets thirty, and makes the same bargain with his
master's brother for Fair Johnie Armstrong's horse. So he goes
back to his wife, and gives her three-score pound for her three
coverlets, two kye as good as her three, and has the third horse
over and above. But Dick sees that he cannot safely remain on the
border after this reprisal upon the Armstrongs, and removes to
Burgh (Brough) under Stainmoor, in the extreme south of
Cumberland.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d185_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Henry Lord Scroop of Bolton was warden of the West Marches for
thirty years from 1563, and his son Thomas for the next ten
years, down to the union of the crowns. Which of the two is
intended in this ballad might be settled beyond question by
identifying my lord's brother, Ralph Scroop, Bailif Glazenberrie,
or Glozenburrie, st. 54 f.; but the former is altogether more
probable.</p>

<p>The Laird's Jock, in the opinion of Mr. R.B. Armstrong, was a
son of Thomas of Mangerton, the elder brother of Gilnockie. There
are notices of him from 1569 to 1599. In 1569 Archibald Armstrong
of Mangerton declined to be pledge for John Armstrong, called the
Lardis Jok, Reg. P. Council; in 1599 he and other principal
Armstrongs executed a bond,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d185_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and he is mentioned (in what
fashion will presently appear) at various intermediate dates.</p>

<p>Jock, the Laird's son, an Armstrong of Lid- desdale, had a
brother called John,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d185_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Manuscript General Register House,
1569. (He is not called Fair John in any document besides the
ballad.) In a later Manuscript there is an entry of the marriage
of John Armstrong, called the Lord's John. John Armstrong, son to
the laird of Mangerton, is witness to two bonds in which John of
the Syde is a party, in 1562, 1563: R.B. Armstrong, History of
Liddesdale, etc., Appendix, pp. ciii, civ. In a London Manuscript
the Lord's John is said to have been executed.</p>

<p>The Laird's Jock, his father the laird of Mangerton, Sim's
Thorn, and their accomplices, are complained of in November,
1582, by Sir Simon Musgrave for burning of his barns, wheat,
etc., worth &#163;1,000 sterling: Nicolson and Burn, History of
Westmoreland and Cumberland, I, xxxi. The commendation of the
Laird's Jock's honesty in st. 47, as Scott says, seems but
indifferently founded; "for in July, 1586, a bill was fouled
against him, Dick of Dryup, and others, by the deputy of
Bewcastle, at a warden-meeting, for four hundred head of cattle
taken in open foray from the Drysike in Bewcastle; and in
September, 1587, another complaint appears, at the instance of
one Andrew Rutledge of the Nook, against the Laird's Jock and his
accomplices, for fifty kine and oxen, besides furniture to the
amount of one hundred merks sterling:" Nicolson and Burn, as
above. To be sure, we find the laird of Mangerton, on the next
page, making complaihts of the same kind against various persons,
but it is to be feared that the Laird's Jock, at least, did not
keep to the innocent's golden rule, 'to steal frae nane but them
that sta from thee.' Sir Richard Maitland gives him his
character:</p>

<p>Hutton Hall, 3, being more than twenty miles from the border,
seems remote for the Armstrongs' first reconnaissance, and it is
no wonder that Fair Johnie stickled at driving six sheep to such
a distance. We might ask how Dick, who evidently lives near
Carlisle (for, besides other reasons, he is intimately acquainted
with the Armstrongs), should have been met so far from home.</p>

<p>Harribie, 14, mentioned also in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_186.html">Kinmont Willie</a>,' was the
place of execution at Carlisle.</p>

<p>Puddingburn House, 16, according to Chambers, Scottish
Ballads, p. 48, was a strong place on the side of the Tinnis
Hill, about three miles westward from the Syde (and therefore a
very little further from the house of Mangerton), of which the
ruins now serve for a sheepfold. A Manuscript cited by Mr. R.B.
Armstrong says: "Joke Armestronge, called the Lord's Joke,
dwelleth under Denys Hill besides Kyrsoppe in Tenisborne;" and in
another Manuscript the Lord Jock of Tennesborne is stated to have
lived a mile west from Kersopp-foote. The name Puddingburn has
not been found on any map.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d185_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Cannobei, 34, is on the east of the Esk, just above its
juncture with the Liddel. Mattan, 52, 58 (Morton in b), is
perhaps the small town a few miles east of Whitehaven. There were
cattle-fairs at Arlochden, which is very nigh, in the early part
of this century: Lysons, Cumberland, p. 10.</p>

<p>The Cow in Dick's name can have no reference to his cattle,
for then his style would have been Dick o the Kye. Cow may
possibly denote the hut in which he lived; or bush, or broom.</p>
