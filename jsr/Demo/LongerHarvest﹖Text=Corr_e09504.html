from the north of Somersetshire and sang it in the dialect 
of that region. Given from memory.</p>

<p>["I do not know any title to this song except 'Hold 
up, hold up your hands so high!' It was by that title 
that we called for it."]</p>

<p>Julius Krohn has lately made an important contribution to our
knowledge of this ballad in an article in Viritt&auml;j&auml;,
II, 36-50, translated into German under the title 'Das Lied vom
M&auml;dchen welches erl&ouml;st werden soll,' Helsingfors, 1891.
Professor Estlander had previously discussed the ballad in Finsk
Tidskrift, X, 1881 (which I have not yet seen), and had sought to
show that it was of Finnish origin, a view which Krohn disputes
and refutes. There are nearly fifty Finnish versions. The curse
with which <b>I</b> ends, and which is noted as occurring in
Swedish <b>C</b> (compare also the Sicilian ballad), is never
wanting in the Finnish, and is found also in the Esthonian
copies.</p>
