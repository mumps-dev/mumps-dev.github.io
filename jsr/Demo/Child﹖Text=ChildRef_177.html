<h3>The Earl of Westmoreland</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Earle of Westmorlande,' Percy Manuscript, p. 112;
Hales and Furnivall, I, 292. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d17701.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>"These lines," says Percy in a note in his Manuscript to I 1,
" are given in one of my old copies to Lord Northumberland; they
seem here corrupted." The first three stanzas, with exten-sive
variations, begin '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_176.html">Northumberland Betrayed by Douglas</a>,' as
printed in the Reliques, I, 258, 1765. It will be remarked that
Percy does not allege that he has an old copy of this ballad,
though he implies he has one of the other, '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_176.html">Northumberland Betrayed by Douglas</a>.'</p>

<p>The earls of Westmoreland and Northumberland, as has been
seen, upon being forced to leave Liddesdale, took refuge for a
short time with one of the Armstrongs, John of the Side (cf. at.
3). They parted company, and Westmoreland, Lady Northumberland,
Francis Norton, and others, were received by Sir Thomas Ker at
Fernihurst, near Jedburgh; Old Norton, Markenfield, and others,
by Buccleuch at Branxholm. Lady Northumberland shortly after
removed to Hume Castle. The Regent Murray sent a secret messenger
to persuade Fernihurst and Buccleuch to render into his hands the
"Earl of Westmoreland and the other her Majesty's principal
rebels being in their bounds," Jan. 14, 1570 (cf. st. 9).
Westmoreland escaped to Flanders in the autumn of 1570, "with
very slight means." He was very desirous to make his pSace with
Elizabeth, but the efforts he made were unsuccessful, and he wore
out thirty-one years in the Low Countries, a pensioner of Spain,
dying at Newport in November, 1601. The countess, his wife,
daughter of the poet Surrey, a highly educated and in every way
admirable woman, was treated by Elizabeth as innocent of treason
(she was a zealous Protestant), and was granted a decent annuity
for the support of herself and her three daughters. The Countess
of Northumberland fled to Flanders in 1570, and lived on the King
of Spain's bounty, separated from her children, and with no
consolation but such as she derived from her intense religious
and theological convictions, until 1596.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d177_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The ballad-story is that after the flight (as it is described)
from Bramham ('Bramaball') Moor, Westmoreland sought refuge with
Jock Armstrong on the west border, who also u took"f or sheltered
Old Norton and other of the rebels. Neville does not think the
Debateable Land safe, and goes to Scotland, to Hume Castle, where
all the banished men find welcome. The Regent is minded to write
to Lord Hume to see whether he can be brought to surrender the
fugitives, but on second thoughts, being at deadly feud with
Hume, he concludes that writing will serve no purpose.
(10<sup>4</sup> is not very intelligible.) He will rather send
for troops from Berwick, and take the men by force. Lord Hume
gets knowledge of the Regent's intention, and removes his guests
to the castle of 'Carnelye.' But still Neville sees that there is
no biding even in Scotland, and he and his comrades take a noble
ship, to be mariners on the sea.</p>

<p>So far the ballad, it will be perceived, has an historical
substratum, though details are incorrect; what follows is pure
fancy work, or rather an imitation of stale old romance.</p>

<p>After cruising three months, a large ship is sighted. Neville
calls Markenfield to council. The latter, who knows every banner
that is borne, knows whether any man that he has once laid eyes
on is friend or foe, knows every language that is spoken, and who
has besides (st. 39) a gift of prophecy. By the serpent and the
serpent's head and the mole in the midst, Markenfield is able to
say that the ship is Don John of Austria's, and he advises
flight. This counsel (which would have lost Neville much glory
and a hundred pounds a day) does not please the earl; he orders
his own standard of the Dun Bull to be displayed. Don John sends
a pinnace, with a herald, to fetch the name of the master of the
ship he has met. Neville refuses to give up his name until he
knows the master of the other vessel; the herald informs him that
it is Duke John of Austria, who lives in Seville; then says the
Briton, Charles Neville is my name, and in England I was Earl of
Westmoreland. The herald makes his report, and is sent back to
invite the nobleman to Don John's ship; for Don John had read in
the 'Book of Mable' that a Briton, Charles Neville, 'with a
child's voice,' should come over the sea. Neville is courteously
received; Don John desires to see his men; it is but a small
company, says the earl, and calls in Markenfield the prophet,
Dacres, Master Norton and four sons, and John of Carnabye. These
are all my company, says Neville; when we were in England, our
prince and we could not agree. The duke says Norton and his sons
shall go to France, and also Dacres, who shall be a captain;
Neville and Markenfield shall go to Seville, and the two others
(there is but one other, John of Carnabye) are to go with Dacres.
Neville will not part with men who have known him in weal and
woe, and the duke says that, seeing he has so much manhood, he
shall part with none of them. Both ships land at Seville, where
the duke recommends Neville to the queen as one who wished to
serve her as captain. The queen, first acquainting herself with
his name, makes Neville captain over forty thousand men, to keep
watch and ward in Seville, and to war against the heathen soldan.
The soldan, learning in Barbary that a venturesome man is in
Seville, sends him, through the queen, a challenge to single
combat, both lands to be joined in one according to the issue of
the fight. The queen declines this particular challenge, but
promises the soldan a fight every day for three weeks, if he
wishes it. Neville overhears all this and offers the queen to
fight the soldan; she thinks it great pity that Neville should
die, though he is a banished man. Don John informs the queen that
he has read in the Book of Mable that a Briton was to come over
the sea, Charles Neville by name, with a child's voice, and that
this man there present hath heart and hand. (62 is corrupted.)
The queen's council put their heads together, and it is
determined that Neville shall fight with the soldan. The battle
is to come off at the Headless Cross. Neville wishes to see the
queen's ensign. In the ensign is a broken sword, with bloody
hands and a headless cross. The all - knowing Markenfield
pronounces that these are a token that the prince has suffered a
sore overthrow. Neville orders his Dun Bull to be set up and
trumpets to blow, makes Markenfield captain over his host during
his absence, and rides to the headless cross, where he finds the
soldan, a foul man to see. The soldan cries out, Is it some
kitchen-boy that comes to fight with me? Neville replies with a
commonplace: thou makest<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d177_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> so little of God's might, the less I
care for thee. After a fierce but indecisive fight of an hour,
the soldan, with a glance at his antagonist, says, No man shall
overcome me except it be Charles Neville. Neville, without
avowing his name, waxes bold, and presently strikes off the
soldan's head. The queen comes out of the city with a procession,
takes the crown from her head, and wishes to make him king on the
spot, but Neville informs her that he has a wife in England. So
the queen calls for a penman and writes Neville down for a
hundred pound a day, for which he returns thanks, and proffers
his services as champion if ever her Grace shall stand in
need.</p>

<p>4. Martinfield is Thomas Markenfield of York, one of the most
active promoters of the rising. He had been long a voluntary
exile on account of religion, but returned to England the year
before the rebellion. He fled to the continent with Westmoreland
and the Nortons, and had a pension of thirty-six florins a month
from Spain.</p>

<p>By Lord Dakers should be meant Edward, son of William, Lord
Dacre, for he is in the list of fugitive rebels demanded of the
Regent Murray by Lord Sussex. He fled to Flanders. But Leonard
Dacre may be intended, who, though he did not take part with the
earls, engaged in a rebellion of his own in February, 1570,
fought and lost a battle, and like the rest fled to Flanders.</p>

<p>5. Only two of Richard Norton's sons went to the Low Countries
with their father, Francis and Sampson. John Carnaby of Langley
is in a list of persons indicted for rebellion. (Sharp, p. 230.)
No reason appears why he should be distinguished.</p>

<p>11. Captain Reed, one of the captains of Berwick, was
suspected of having to do with the rebels, and on one occasion
was observed to be in company with some of the Nortons, in arms.
He was committed to ward, but Lord Hunsdon stood his friend and
brought him through safely. Sharp, p. 15 f.</p>

<p>21 ff. Don John's sole connection with the rebels seems to
have been the paying of their pensions for the short time during
which he was governor of the Netherlands, 1576-78. Westmoreland's
pension was two hundred florins a month. (Sharp, p. 223,
note.)</p>
