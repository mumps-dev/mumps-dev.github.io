<h3>262. Lord Livingston</h3>

<p>As far as can be made out, Livingston and Seaton engage
themselves to play against one another at some game, the victor
expecting to stand the better in the eyes of a lady. They then
proceed to Edinburgh castle, where a lady, whose 'gowns seem like
green,' marshals the company in pairs, and chooses Livingston for
her own partner. This preference enrages Seaton, who challenges
Livingston to fight with him the next day. Up to this point the
pairing may have been for a dance, or what not, but now we are
told that Livingston and the fair dame are laid in the same bed,
and further on that they were wedded that same night. In the
morning Livingston arms himself for his fight; he declines to let
his lady dress herself in man's clothes and fight in his stead.
On his way 'to plain fields' a witch warns him that she has had
the dream which Sweet William dreams in No, 74, and others
elsewhere. Livingston is 'slain,' but for all that stands
presently bleeding by his lady's knee. She begs him to hold out
but half an hour, and every leech in Edinburgh shall come to him
(see No, 88, <b>A</b> 12, etc.). He orders his lands to be dealt
as in 'Bonny Bee Horn'.(No, 92). The lady will now do for his
sake what other ladies would not be equal to (what nevertheless
many other ballad-ladies have undertaken, as in No, 69 and
elsewhere). When seven years are near an end her heart breaks.</p>

<p>This ballad, or something like it, was known at the end of the
eighteenth century.</p>
