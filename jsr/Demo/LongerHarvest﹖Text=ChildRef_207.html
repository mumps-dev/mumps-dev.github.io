<p>Of <b>D</b> the editor says: "An imperfect copy ... was noted
down by us from the singing of a gentleman in this city
[Glasgow], which has necessarily been remodelled and smoothed
down to the present measure, without any other liberties,
however, having been taken with the original narrative, which is
here carefully preserved as it was committed to us." The air,
says Lyle, was "beautiful, and peculiar to the ballad."</p>

<p>Dr. Rimbault remembered hearing a version sung at a village in
Staffordshire, about 1842, in which Hereford was substituted for
Devonshire: Notes and Queries, First Series, V, 348, 1852.</p>

<p>Lord Delamere, upon occasion of the imposition of some new
taxes, begs a boon of the king, in the Parliament House; it is
that he may have all the poor men in the land down to Cheshire
and hang them, since it would be better for them to be hanged
than to be starved. A French (Dutch) lord says that Delamere
ought to be stabbed for publicly affronting the king. The Duke of
Devonshire offers himself to fight for Delamere, and a stage is
set up for a duel to the utterance. Devonshire's sword bends at
the first thrust and then breaks. An English lord who is standing
by (Willoughby, <b>B</b>) gives him another, and advises him to
play low, for there is treachery. Devonshire drops on his knee
and gives his antagonist his death-wound. The king orders the
dead man to be taken away, but Devonshire insists on first
examining the body. He finds that the French lord had been wear
ing armor, and the king's armor, while he himself was fighting
bare. He reproaches the king with the purpose of taking his life,
and tells him that he shall not have his armor back until he wins
it.</p>

<p>According to the title of <b>B</b>, the duel was between
Devonshire and Lord Danby, and in 1687. The other party is,
however, called a Dutch lord in the ballad. The king is James.
Delamere is said to be under age (he was thirty-five in 1687).</p>

<p>In <b>D</b>, Delamere is changed to Delaware, of Lincolnshire;
the Duke of Devonshire is called a Welsh lord, and fights a Dutch
lord in defence of young Delaware. When Devonshire's sword
breaks, he springs from the stage, borrows another from a soldier
in the ring, and leaps back to the stage.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that the duel is on a par for
historical verity with that in 'Johnie Scot' (No 99). If there
was to be a duel, Devonshire (Earl, he was not created Duke till
1694, the last year of Delamere's life) was well chosen for the
nonce. He had fought with Lord Mohun, in 1676, and was credited
with challenging Count Konigsmark, in 1682. What is true in the
ballad is that Delamere was a strenuous and uncompromising
advocate of constitutional government, and that he and Devonshire
were political and personal friends. Both were particularly
active in bringing in the Prince of Orange; and so was Lord
Danby, with whom, according to the title of B, Devonshire was
fighting the duel the year before the revolution.</p>

<p>It has been suggested,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d207_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and it is barely conceivable, that
the ballad may have grown out of a perverted report of the affair
of the Earl of Devonshire with Colonel Colepepper.</p>

<p>"On Sunday the 24th of April, 1687, the said earl, meeting on
Colonel Culpepper in the drawing-room in Whitehall (who had
formerly affronted the said earl in the king's palace, for which
he had not received any satisfaction), he spake to the said
colonel to go with him into the next room, who went with him
accordingly; and when they were there, the said earl required of
him to go down stairs, that he might have satisfaction for the
affront done him, as aforesaid; which the colonel refusing to do,
the said earl struck him with his stick, as is supposed."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d207_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
For this, Devonshire was summoned to the King's Bench and
required to give sureties to the amount of &#163;30,000 that he
would appear to stand trial. Delamere was surety for &#163;5,000.
Devonshire was in the end fined &#163;30,000, and Delamere made a
strong plea, apparently in the House of Lords, against the
legality of the proceedings of the court.</p>

<p>There is the slightest possible similitude here to the facts
of the ballad. It is merely that one party stands up for the
other; but Delamere appears as the champion of Devonshire, not
Devonshire of Delamere. If Devonshire had testified for Delamere
when the latter was tried for high treason in 1686, there would
be something to go upon. A more plausible explanation is
desirable.</p>
