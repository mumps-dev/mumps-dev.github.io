<h3>The Clerk's Twa Sons o Owensford</h3>

</ol>

<p><b>A</b>, as sung, had a sequel of six stanzas, which is found
separately and seems to belong with another ballad, '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_79.html">The Wife of Usher's Well</a>.'
Robert Chambers combined <b>A</b> with Buchan's
version, <b>C</b>, and the six concluding stanzas with '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_79.html">The Wife of Usher's Well</a>,'
and divided his ballad into two parts, "on
account of the great superiority of what follows over what goes
before, and because the latter portion is in a great measure
independent of the other:" The Scottish Ballads, pp 345-50. His
second reason for a division is better than his first. It is
quite according to precedent for a ballad to end with a vow like
that in <b>A</b> 17, <b>D</b> 14: see 'Clerk Saunders.'</p>

<p><b>D</b> has some amusing dashes of prose, evidently of
masculine origin: "They thought their father's service mean,
their mother's no great affair," 2; "When he was certain of the
fact, an angry man was he," 6; "That I may ride to fair Berwick,
and see what can be done," 8. We have here a strong contrast with
both the blind-beggar and the housemaid style of corruption;
something suggesting the attorney's clerk rather than the clerk
of Owsenford, but at least not mawkish.</p>

<p>There are ballads both in Northern and in Southern Europe
which have a certain amount of likeness with 'The Clerk's Twa
Sons,' but if the story of all derives from one original, time
has introduced great and even unusual variations.</p>

<p>In the Scottish ballad two youths go to Paris to study, and
have an amour with the mayor's daughters, for which they are
thrown into prison and condemned to be hanged. The Clerk, their
father, comes to the prison, asks them what is their offence, and
learns that it is a little dear bought love. He offers the mayor
a ransom for their lives, and is sternly refused. The mayor's two
daughters beg for their true-love's lives with the same bad
success. The students are hanged, and the father goes home to
tell his wife that they are put to a higher school. She, <b>A</b>
[he, <b>D</b>], vows to pass the rest of her days in penance and
grief.</p>

<p>A very well known German ballad, found also in the Low
Countries and in Scandinavia, has the following story.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d072_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A
youth is lying in a dungeon, condemned to be hanged. His father
comes to the town, and they exchange words about the severity of
his prison. The father then goes to the lord of the place and
offers three hundred florins as a ransom. Ransom is refused: the
boy has a gold chain on his neck which will be his death. The
father says that the chain was not stolen, but the gift of a
young lady, who reared the boy as a page, or what not. There is
no dear bought love in the case. The father, standing by the
gallows, threatens revenge, but his son deprecates that: he cares
not so much for his life as for his mother's grief. Within a bare
half year, more than three hundred men pay with their lives for
the death of the boy.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d072_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A Spanish and Italian ballad has resemblances with the
Scottish and the German, and may possibly be a common link: 'Los
tres estudiantes,' Mil&aacute;, Romancerillo, p. 165, No 208,
<b>A</b>-<b>L</b>, previously, in Observaciones, etc., p. 104, No
6, 'Los estudiantes de Tolosa;' 'Los estudians de Tortosa,' Briz
y Candi, I, 101; ' Gli scolari di Tolosa,' Nigra, Rivista
Contemporanea, XX, 62. Three students meet three girls, and
attempt some little jests with them: ask them for a kiss,
Mil&aacute;, <b>H</b>; throw small pebbles at them, Mil&aacute;,
<b>D</b>; meet one girl on a bridge and kiss her, Nigra. For this
the girls have them arrested by an accommodating catchpoll, and
they are hanged by a peremptory judge. The youngest student weeps
all the time; the eldest tries to console him; their brother
serves a king or duke, and if he hears of what has been done will
kill judge, constable, and all their scribes. The brother gets
word somehow, and comes with all speed, but the three clerks are
hanged before he arrives. He gives the town of Tolosa to the
flames, the streets run with the blood of the judge, and horses
swim in the blood of the girls, Mil&aacute;, <b>C</b>, Briz; the
streets are washed with the blood of women, walls built of the
heads of men, Mil&aacute;, <b>A</b>; etc.</p>

<p>In a pretty passage in Buchan's not altogether trustworthy
version, <b>C</b> 35-38, the clerks ask back their faith and
troth before they die. For this ceremony see '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_77.html">Sweet William's Ghost</a>.'</p>

<p>Aytoun's ballad is translated by Knortz Schottische Balladen,
p. 72, No 23.</p>
