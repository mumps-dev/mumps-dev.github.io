</ol>

<p>Scott's Minstrelsy, I, 164, 1802, II, 90, 1833. The source is
not mentioned, but was undoubtedly Caw's Museum, though there are
variations of text, attributable to the editor. A copy in the
Campbell Manuscripts, I, 230, is again from the Museum, with
several corrections, two of which are also found in Scott. Caw
received the ballad, says Sir Walter, from John Elliot of
Reidheugh. <b>b</b> seems to have been sent Percy (with '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_185.html">Dick o the Cow</a>')
by Roger Halt, in 1775.</p>

<p>Hobie Noble, though banished from Bewcastle for his
irregularities, will always command the hearty liking of those
who live too late to suffer from them, on account of his gallant
bearing in the rescue of Jock o the Side. See especially No 187,
<b>A</b>, of which Hobie is the hero. All that we know of him is
so much as we are told in that ballad and in this. He attached
himself, after his expulsion from England, to the laird of
Mangerton, who gives him the praise 'Thy coat is blue, thou has
been true.'</p>

<p>Sim o the Mains, an Armstrong of the Whithaugh branch (the
most important after that of Mangerton), undertakes to betray
Hobie to the English land-sergeant. A tryst is set at
Kershope-foot, the junction of that stream with the Liddel; and
Hobie, who lives a little way up the Liddel, rides eagerly down
the water to keep it. He meets five men, who ask him to join them
in a raid into England. Hobie dares not go by day; the
land-sergeant is at feud with him on account of a brother's
death, in which Hobie must have had a hand, and 'the great earl
of Whitfield' has suffered from his depredations;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d189_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> but he
will be their guide if they will wait till night. He takes them
to the Foulbogshiel, where they alight, and word is sent by Sim
to the land-sergeant at Askerton, his adversary's residence; the
land-sergeant orders the men of the neighborhood to meet him at
day break. Hobie has a bad dream, wakes his comrades in alarm,
and sets out to guide them across the Waste; but the sergeant's
force come before him, and Sim behind; his sword breaks; he is
bound with his own bow-string and taken to Carlisle. As he goes
up the quarter called the Rickergate, the wives say one to the
other, That 's the man that loosed Jock o the Side! They offer
him bread and beer, and urge him to confess stealing "my lord's"
horses; he swears a great oath that he never had beast of my
lord's. He is to die the next day, and says his farewell to
Mangerton; he would rather be called 'Hobie Noble' and be hanged
in Carlisle, than be called 'Traitor Mains' and eat and drink.</p>

<p>Mr R.B. Armstrong informs me that he has found no notice of
Hobie Noble except that Hobbe Noble, with eight others, "lived
within the Nyxons, near to Bewcastle."</p>

<p>1569. "Lancy Armistrang of Quhithauch obliged him ... for Sym
Armistrang of the Mains and the rest of the Armistrangis of his
gang. Syme of the Mains was lodged in Wester Wemys." (Register of
the Privy Council of Scotland.)</p>

<p>4. The Mains was a place a very little to the east of
Castleton, on the opposite, or north, Bide of the Liddel. 13-17.
Askerton is in the Waste of Bewcastle, "about seventeen miles"
northeast of Carlisle. "Willeva and Spear-Edom [otherwise
Spade-Adam] are small districts in Bewcastle dale, through which
also the Hartlie-burn takes its course. Conscowthart-Green and
Rodric-haugh and the Foulbogshiel are the names of places in the
same wilds, through which the Scottish plunderers generally made
their raids upon England." (Scott.)</p>

<p>Sim o the Mains fled into England from the resentment of his
chief, but was himself executed at Carlisle about two months
after Hobie's death. "Such is at least the tradition of
Liddesdale," says Scott. This is of course, notwithstanding the
precision of the interval of two months, what Lord Bacon calls
"an imagination as one would"; an appendage of a later
generation, in the interest of poetical justice.</p>
