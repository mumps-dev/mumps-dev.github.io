<p><b>A</b> was inserted in the fourth volume of The Tea-Table
Miscellany, and stands in the edition of 1763 at p. 321, 'Rare
Willie drowned in Yarrow,' It is given in Herd's Ancient and
Modern Scots Songs, 1769, p. 197 (with two or three trifling
changes); in Johnson's Museum, p. 542, No 525. <b>F</b> is
epitomized in Christie's Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 66, "with
some changes from the way the editor has heard it sung."</p>

<p>The fragment in Cromek's Select Scotish Songs, 1810, II, 196,
sent by Burns in a letter to William Tytler, 1790, belongs, as
already said, mostly with '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_212.html">The Duke of Athole's Nurse</a>,' but has
two stanzas of 'Willie drowned in Yarrow' (<b>B</b>).</p>

<p>'The Braes of Yarrow,' Ritson's Scotish Song, I, 154, composed
upon the story of this ballad by the Rev. John Logan (1748-88),
has two of the original lines (nearly):</p>

<p>They sought him east, they sought him west,<br/>
They sought him all the forest thorough.</p>

<p>Willie is drowned in Yarrow according to the older (southern)
tradition, <b>A</b>; also <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. In the northern
copies, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, with which <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>, agree, the scene is transferred to Gamrie, on the coast
of the Moray Frith, where, as Christie remarks, "there is no
water that Willie could have been drowned in but the sea, on his
way along the sands to the old kirk."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d215_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In the ballad which
follows this, a western variety of the same story, Willie is
drowned in the Clyde.</p>

<p><b>C</b> 2, 3, 5, 6, belong to the preceding ballad, and 4 is
common to that and this.</p>

<p><b>A</b> 2 would come in better at the end of the story (as it
does in <b>C</b>, a copy of slight authority), if it might
properly find a place anywhere in the ballad. But this stanza
suits only a woman who has been for some time living with her
husband. A woman on her wedding-day could have no call to make
her bed broad in her mother's house, whether yestreen or the
morrow. I therefore conclude that <b>A</b> 2 does not belong to
this ballad.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d215_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>D</b>-<b>H</b>. Rare Willie has promised to marry Meggie,
<b>E</b> (also <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>). His mother would
give her the wale of all her other sons, but not Willie; she will
have him only; <b>D</b>, <b>E</b> (cf. <b>G</b> 1). The
bridegroom, with a large company, is mounted to ride for the
bride; he tells his friends to go forward, he has forgotten to
ask his mother's blessing; <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>H</b>. He receives the blessing, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>;
her blessing goes not with him, <b>G</b>; he gets her heavy
curse, <b>E</b>; even in <b>F</b> his mother, after giving her
blessing, says that he will never see his wedding. (The mother's
curse is the characteristic feature of the next following ballad.)
The bridal party come to the river, or burn, of Gamrie; all the
others pass the stream safely, but Willie is washed from his
saddle, <b>D</b>-<b>H</b>. The rest ride on to the kirk of
Gamrie. The bride asks where is the man who was to marry her, and
is told that Willie is drowned. She tears the ribbons from her
hair and runs to the river, plunges in, and finds Willie in the
deepest pot, the middle, the deepest weil. She will make her bed
with him in Gamrie; both mothers shall be alike sorry;
<b>D</b>-<b>G</b>.</p>

<p>In <b>H</b>, Willie's horse comes home with an empty saddle.
His mother is sure that her son is dead; her daughter tries in
vain to persuade her that all is well; Meggie takes her lover's
body from the river and lays it on the grass; she will sleep with
him in the same grave at Gamrie.</p>

<p>In <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, the drowned body is found in the cleft
of a rock, the clifting or clintin of a craig; in <b>C</b> 4
neath a buss of brume, that stanza belonging, as most of the copy
does, to the preceding ballad; cf. <b>J</b> 14, <b>K</b> 11 of No
214. The bride ties three links of her hair, which is three
quarters long, round Willie's waist, and draws him out of the
water, <b>B</b> 2, <b>C</b> 5; for the hair, cf. No 214, where
also it is not advantageously used. The bride's tearing the
ribbons from her head, <b>D</b> 12, <b>E</b> 15, <b>F</b> 8,
<b>G</b> 7, <b>H</b> 14, is found also in No 214, <b>D</b> 11,
<b>I</b> 12, but is inappropriate there. A brother, brother John,
whether the man's or the woman's, tells the bad news in No 214,
<b>A</b> 11, <b>E</b> 9, <b>I</b> 8, <b>L</b> 11, <b>N</b> 9, 10,
as here <b>D</b> 11, <b>E</b> 14, <b>F</b> 7, <b>G</b> 6,
<b>H</b> 13.</p>

<p>'Annan Water,' a ballad in which a lover is drowned on his way
to visit his mistress, is given in an appendix.</p>
