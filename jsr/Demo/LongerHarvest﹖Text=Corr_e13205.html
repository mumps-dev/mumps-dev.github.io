<h3>132. The Bold Pedlar and Robin Hood</h3>


<p>P. 155. The following copy, entitled 'Robin Hood and the Proud
Pedlar,' is from a garland in a collection of folio sheet-ballads
mostly dated 1775, in the British Museum, 1346. m. 7(9). The
Museum catalogue assigns the ballads to Edinburgh. I owe my
knowledge of this piece to Mr. P.Z. Round.</p>

a proud pedlar he seemd to be,<br/>
And he's taen his pack upon his back,<br/>
and went linking over the lee.</td></tr>

then pack and all to him I'll gie.'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">6 &nbsp;</td>
