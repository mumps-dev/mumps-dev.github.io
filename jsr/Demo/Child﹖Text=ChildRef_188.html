<p><b>B</b> <b>a</b> was printed by Scott in the first edition of
his Minstrelsy, with the omission of stanzas 11, 13,
15<sup>3-6</sup> (15<sup>3,4</sup>, 16<sup>1,2</sup>, of the
Manuscript), 17<sup>3,4</sup> (18<sup>1,2</sup> of the
Manuscript), 27, 28, and with many editorial improvements,
besides Scotticising of the spelling. Of <b>B</b> <b>b</b>, the
form in which the ballad appears in the later edition of the
Minstrelsy, the editor says that he has been enabled to add
several stanzas obtained from recitation, of which he remarks
that, "as they contrast the brutal indifference of the elder
brother with the zeal and spirit of his associates, they add
considerably to the dramatic effect of the whole." The new
stanzas are ten, and partly displace some of <b>a</b>. None of
the omitted stanzas are restored, and the other changes
previously made are retained, except of course where new stanzas
have been introduced.</p>

<p>This ballad is in all the salient features a repetition of
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_187.html">Jock o the Side</a>,' Halls playing the parts of Armstrongs. The
Halls are several times complained of for reif and awaytaking of
ky, oxen, etc., in 1579. There is a Jok Hall of the Sykis, Jok
Hall, called Paitti's Jok, a Jokie Hall in the Clintis, and the
name Archie Hall occurs, which is, to be sure, a matter of very
slight consequence. See the Register of the Privy Council of
Scotland, III, 236 f., 354 f. Cafield is about a mile west of
Langholm, in Wauchopedale. The Armstrongs had spread into
Wauchopedale in the sixteenth century, and Jock Armstrong of the
Caffeild appears in the Registers of the Privy Council, III, 43,
85, 133, 535. I have not found Halls of Caffeild, and hope not to
do them injustice by holding that some friend or member of that
sept has substituted their name, for the glory of the
family.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d188_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>From a passage in A History of Dumfries, by William Bennet, in
The Dumfries Monthly Magazine, III, 9 f., July, 1826 (kindly
brought to my attention by Mr. Macmath), there appears to have
been a version of this ballad in which the Johnstones played the
part of the Halls, or Armstrongs; but against their enemies the
Maxwells, not against the public authority. A gentleman of
Dumfries informed Bennet that he had "often, in early life,
listened to an interesting ballad, sung by an old female
chronicle of the town, which was founded upon the following
circumstance. In some fray between the Maxwells and Johnstones,
the former had taken the chief of the latter prisoner, and shut
him up in the jail of Dumfries, in Lochmaben gate; for in
Dumfries they possessed almost the same power as in the Stewartry
of Annandale, Crichton of Sanquhar, who was then hereditary
sheriff of Nithsdale, being their retainer. In a dark night
shortly afterwards, a trusty band of the Johnstones marched
secretly into Dumfries, and, surprising the jail-keepers, bore
off their chief, manacled as he then was, and, placing him behind
one of their troopers, galloped off towards the head of Locher,
there to regain the Tinwald side and strike into the mountains of
Moffat before their enemies should have leisure to start in
pursuit. A band of the Maxwells, happening to be in town, and
instantly receiving the alarm, started in pursuit of the
fugitives, and overtook them about the dawn of morning, just as
they had suddenly halted upon the banks of the Locher, and seemed
to hesitate about risking its passage; for the stream was much
swollen by a heavy rain which had lately fallen, and seemed to
threaten destruction to any who should dare to enter it. On
seeing the Maxwells, however, and reflecting upon the comparative
smallness of their own party, they plunged in, and, by dextrous
management, reached in safety the opposite bank at the moment
their pursuers drew up on the brink of that which they had left.
The Johnstones had now the decided advantage, for, had their
enemies ventured to cross, they could, while struggling against
the current, have been easily destroyed. The bloodthirsty
warriors raged and shook their weapons at each other across the
stream; but the flood rolled on as if in mockery of their
threatenings, and the one party at length galloped off in
triumph, while the other was compelled to return in disgrace."</p>

<p>There are three Halls in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
brothers, of whom Archie is a prisoner, condemned to die. The
actors in <b>D</b> are not said to be brothers or Halls; the
prisoner is Archie, as before. In <b>A</b>, Jock the laird and
Dickie effect the rescue, assisted by Jocky Ha, a cousin. Dick is
the leader, Jocky Ha subordinate, and Jock the laird is the
despondent and repining personage, corresponding to Much in Jock
o the Side, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, and to the Laird's Wat, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>. In <b>B</b>, Dick is the only brother named; he and
Jokie Hall from Teviotdale effect the rescue; Jokie Hall is
prominent, and Dickie has the second place; Archie the prisoner
is faint-hearted, but, properly speaking, that part is omitted.
Jokie Hall represents Hobie Noble, who is the leader in <b>A</b>
of the other ballad, as Jokie is here in <b>B</b>, and also
<b>C</b>; whereas Dick is the leader in <b>A</b>, <b>D</b> of the
ballad before us, and represents the Laird's Jock, who is
principal in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> of the other. In <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, only two are concerned in breaking the jail. In
<b>C</b>, Dick loses heart, or has the place of Much; in
<b>D</b>, Caff o Lin.</p>

<p>In <b>A</b> 38, Jock the laird says his colt will drown him if
he attempts to cross the river; so Dick in <b>B</b> 23 (for it
can be no other, though Dick is not named) and in <b>C</b> 24,
and Caff o Lin in <b>D</b> 14. They have not two attacks of
panic, as Much has in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_187.html">Jock o the Side</a>,' <b>A</b>, with such
excellent effect in bringing out Hobie Noble's steadiness. To
make up for this, however, the laird has an unheroic qualm after
all is well over, in <b>A</b> 44: the dearsome night has cost him
Cawfield! It is a fine-spirited answer that Dick makes: 'Light o
thy lands! we should not have been three brothers.' In one of the
stanzas which Scott added in <b>B</b> <b>b</b>, "coarse
Ca'field," that is, the laird again, is addressed
(inconsecutively, as the verses stand) with the like reproach:
'Wad ye even your lands to your born billy!'</p>

<p>Archie is prisoner at Dumfries in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, at Annan
in <b>C</b>; in <b>D</b> no place is mentioned. The route
followed in <b>A</b> is Barnglish,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d188_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> only two or three miles
westward, where the horse-shoes are turned, 8; Bonshaw wood,
where they take counsel, 10; over the Annan at Hoddam, 12, to
Dumfries, 13; back by Bonshaw Shield, where they again take
counsel, 29; over the Annan at Annan Holm (Annan Bank?), opposite
Warnphray (where the Johnstones would be friendly), 31, to
Cafield. Bonshaw Shield would have to be somewhere between
Dumfries and Annan Water; it seems to be an erroneous repetition
of the Bonshaw on the left of the Annan.</p>

<p>The route in <b>B</b> is The Murraywhat, where shoes are
turned, 6; Dumfries, 8; back by Lochmaben, 17; The Murraywhat,
where they file off the shackles, 18; to and across the Annan.
Here we may ask why the shoes are not changed earlier; for The
Murraywhat is on the west side of the Annan. The route in
<b>C</b> is not described; there is no reason, if they start from
Cafield (see 23), why they should cross the Annan, the town being
on the eastern side. All difficulties are escaped in <b>D</b> by
giving no names.</p>

<p>The New England copy, <b>F</b>, naturally enough, names no
places. There are three brothers, as in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, and Dickie is the leader. The prisoner, here called
Archer, gives up hope when he comes to the river; his horse is
lame and cannot swim; but horses are shifted, and he gets over.
His spirits are again dashed when he sees the sheriff in
pursuit.</p>

<p>A, 6<sup>2</sup>, 14<sup>2</sup>, 16<sup>4</sup>, 'for leugh o
Liddesdale cracked he,' is explained by  <b>B</b> <b>a</b>,
10<sup>2</sup>, 'fra the laigh of Tiviotdale was he;' he bragged
for lower Liddesdale, was from lower Liddesdale; it seems to be a
sort of &#949;&#8020;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#959;
&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#945;&#953;. <b>B</b> <b>b</b> reads (that
is, Scott corrects), 'The luve of Teviotdale was he.' <b>B</b>
<b>a</b>, 16<sup>4</sup>, 'And her girth was the gold-twist to
be,' is unintelligible to me, and appears to be corrupt, <b>b</b>
reads, And that was her gold-twist to be, an emendation of
Scott's, gold-twist meaning "the small gilded chains drawn across
the chest of a war-horse." The three stanzas introduced in
<b>B</b> <b>b</b> after 7 (the colloquy with the smith) are
indifferent modern stuff. This and something worse are <b>C</b>
14, where Johnny Ha takes the prisoner on his back and leads the
mare, the refreshments in 16, 17, and the sheriff in 19-21, 28,
29.</p>
