<p>No copy of this ballad earlier than the last century is known
to me. The Museum Catalogue gives a conjectural date of 1740 to
<b>a</b> and of 1720 to <b>b</b>, and, conjecturally again, as
signs both to Newcastle, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>e</b> are also
without date, <b>c</b> may be as old as <b>b</b>; <b>d</b>,
<b>e</b> are at least not old, and <b>f</b> is of this century.
The ballad was given under the title 'Graeme and Bewick,' in
Scott's Minstrelsy, 1803, III, 93, "from the recitation of a
gentleman " who remembered it but imperfectly. In a succeeding
edition, III, 66, 1833, deficiencies were partly supplied and
some different readings adopted "from a copy obtained by the
recitation of an ostler in Carlisle." The first copy (entitled
'Chirstie Graeme') was sent Scott by William Laidlaw, January 3,
1803 (Letters, vol. i, No 78), as taken down by him from the
singing of Mr. Walter Grieve, in Craik, on Borthwick Water. It is
preserved in "Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy,"
No 89, Abbotsford (<b>h</b>); and in the same volume, No 145, is
what is shown by internal evidence to be the ostler's copy
(<b>g</b>). Both copies were indisputably derived from print,
though h may have passed through several mouths, <b>g</b> agrees
with <b>b</b>-<b>f</b> closely as to minute points of phraseology
which it is difficult to believe that a reciter would have
retained. It looks more like an immediate, though faulty,
transcript from print. Of many deviations, though most may be
chargeable to a bad copyist, or, if one pleases, a bad memory,
others indicate an original which differed in some particulars
from b-f; and the same may perhaps be true of h, which is, how
ever, of only very trifling value.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d211_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>'The Brothers-in-Arms,' Maidment, Scotish Ballads and Songs,
1868, II, 150, is Scott's later copy.</p>

<p>Old Graham and old Bewick are drinking together at Carlisle.
Graham proposes the health of their respective sons. Bewick
demurs. Young Graham is no peer for young Bewick, who is good at
both books and arms, whereas Graham is no scholar. Old Graham
goes home mortified and angry, repeats to his son Christy what
Bewick had said, and bids him, as he would have his blessing,
prove that he can at least hold his own in a fight with young
Bewick. Christy is 'faith and troth,' or sworn-brother, to young
Bewick, and begs his father to forbear. The father insists;
Christy may make his choice, to fight with young Bewick or with
himself. Christy, upon reflection, concludes that it would be a
less crime to kill his sworn-brother than to kill his father, but
swears that, should it be his lot to kill his friend, he will
never come home alive. He arms himself and goes to seek his
comrade. Bewick, who has been teaching his five scholars their
fence, and apparently also their psalms, is walking in his
father's close, with his sword under his arm, and sees a man in
armor riding towards him. Recognizing Graham, he welcomes him
affectionately. Graham informs him that he has come to fight with
him, rehearses the scene with old Graham, and puts by all his
friend's remonstrances and the suggestion that the fathers may be
reconciled through arbitrators. Forced to fight, Bewick vows, as
Graham had done, that, if it be his fortune to kill his brother,
he will never go home alive. Graham throws off his armor that he
may have no advantage; they fight two hours with no result, and
then Graham gives Bewick one of those 'ackward' strokes which
have determined several duels in foregoing ballads. The wound is
deadly; Bewick intreats Graham to fly the country; Graham swears
that his vow shall be kept, leaps on his sword and is the first
to die. Old Bewick comes up and is disposed to congratulate his
son on his victory. Young Bewick begs him to make one grave for
both, and to lay young Graham on the sunny side, for he had been
the better man. The two fathers indulge in exclamations of
grief.</p>

<p>I am persuaded that there was an older and better copy of this
ballad than those which are extant. The story is so well
composed, proportion is so well kept, on the whole, that it is
reasonable to suppose that certain passages (as stanzas 3, 4, 50)
may have suffered some injury. There are also phrases which are
not up to the mark of the general style, as the hack-rhymester
lines at 7<sup>3</sup>, 19<sup>2</sup>. But it is a fine-spirited
ballad as it stands, and very infectious.</p>

<p>"The ballad is remarkable," observes Sir Walter Scott, "as
containing probably the very latest allusion to the institution
of brother hood in arms." And he goes on to say: "The quarrel of
the two old chieftains over their wine is highly in character.
Two generations have not elapsed [1803] since the custom of
drinking deep and taking deadly revenge for slight offences
produced very tragical events on the border; to which the custom
of going armed to festive meetings contributed not a little."</p>

<p>Scott's later edition is translated by Lo&egrave;ve-Veimars,
p. 323; by Rosa Warrens, Schottische Volkslieder der Vorzeit, p.
99, No 22.</p>
