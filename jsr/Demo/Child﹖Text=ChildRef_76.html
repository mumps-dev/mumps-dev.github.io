<p><b>A</b>, never as yet published, is from a manuscript of the
first half of the last century. <b>B</b>, the earliest printed
copy, was given by Herd, from his manuscript, in 1776, with his
usual fidelity. Scott followed, in 1802, with a copy obtained
from Mrs. Brown by Alexander Fraser Tytler in 1800, introducing
six stanzas from <b>B</b> and five from <b>F</b>, and a few
readings from two recited copies. This compounded copy is the one
that is most generally known. Jamieson printed, in 1806,
<b>D</b>, a version written down from Mrs. Brown's recitation in
1783, giving it not quite <i>verbatim</i>, as he says (he
changes, for instance, Rochroyal to Lochroyan), but in general
adhering to his text. <b>E</b> <b>a</b>, the copy principally
used by Scott, is, to a considerable extent, a repetition of
<b>D</b>, but is by no means an imperfectly remembered version of
its predecessor (which was written down seventeen years earlier),
filled out by Mrs. Brown's improvised inventions. <b>E</b>
<b>a</b> has stanzas not found in <b>D</b>, two of which occur in
<b>B</b>, and is to be regarded as a blending of two independent
versions known to Mrs. Brown, which no doubt had much in common,
though not so much as <b>D</b> and <b>E</b> <b>a</b>. The whole
of the fragment <b>F</b> has not been published hitherto, but
five of the eight stanzas are interpolated into Scott's copy,
including the two last, which are shown by the very style to be
spurious. Fairy charms have been exercised on Lord Gregory,
according to the final stanza of <b>F</b>, and Lord Gregory calls
his dame "witch mother" in <b>C</b> 10. But there appears to be
no call for magic or witchcraft in the case. A man who is asleep
is simply not informed by an ill disposed mother that a woman
whom he would like to see is at the door; that is all.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d076_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>A</b>, the oldest copy, has a preliminary history wanting
in the others. Isabel of Rochroyal has a dream about her lover.
She orders her horse, to ride till she comes to some hold. She
meets a company, who ask her questions about a first and a second
young may, which she seems to understand, but which are not made
intelligible to us. They then ask whether she be Isabel of
Rochroyal, and she answers that she is that same lady, banished
from kith and kin; why, we are not informed, but we might
conjecture that it would be on account of her relations with Love
Gregory. She is directed to Gregory's castle, tirls at the pin,
and begs admission. Gregory's mother answers as and for her son,
and demands proofs of her being the lass of Rochroyal. These are
given, and the mother says that Gregory is gone to sea. Hereupon
Isabel breaks out into exclamations as to her helpless condition;
who will take care of her? who will be the bairn's father till
Gregory come home? The mother replies that she will do all that
is necessary for her, but there is none to be her bairn's father
till Gregory return. This is in itself unnatural, since the
mother is hostile to her son's love, and it is counter to what we
read in the other versions. In <b>B</b> as in <b>A</b>, to be
sure, the lass is said to be banished from her kin, but her kin
nevertheless show a disposition to do all that is in their power
in the way of kind attentions. The other copies say nothing of
her family being alienated. The father in <b>D</b> even furnishes
his daughter with a bonny ship, to go to her true-love. If we
seek to reconcile these accounts, we must take the banishment as
a separation for which only the fates are responsible, and
suppose that verses are lost in <b>A</b> after 17 which narrated
Annie's return to her own family. The lass says, st. 22, that she
will set her foot on ship-board, having been told by the mother,
st. 17, that Gregory is on the sea. Gregory, in turn, has his
dream, that his love has been knocking at the door, and his
mother tells him that she has not been gone half an hour, and
gets his curses for not informing him. Gregory orders his
swiftest horse, to ride till he comes to some hold, and presently
meets a funeral train who are carrying his love to burial. This
conclusion, found also in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, is that of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_75.html">Lord Lovel</a>'
and '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_74.html">Fair Margaret and Sweet William</a>,' and must perhaps
be
set aside as not the original one. In <b>B</b> Gregory kills
himself, as Lord Lovel does in one copy, <b>E</b>.</p>

<p>The whole story as <b>A</b> actually stands, notwithstanding
that the lass says she will take ship, seems to pass on land. Two
different relations may have been confounded. In the other
versions Love Gregory is somewhere over sea, and in <b>B</b>,
<b>F</b> his lass is indebted for his direction, not to a company
who are raking over the lea, but to a sea-rover, who shows a
consideration not to be looked for from his class.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d076_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The maid,
repulsed by Gregory's mother, and supposing herself to be cast
off by Gregory himself, sails away from his castle, and in
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b> encounters a storm, and is wrecked. In
<b>D</b> Gregory rushes to the strand near which his castle lies,
sees Annie sailing away, witnesses the wreck of her vessel,
plunges into the sea and brings her body to land, and dies of
heartbreak. So in <b>E</b>, with the difference that Annie's body
is thrown ashore by the waves, and that the tale does not finish
with the death of Gregory, which we know must have followed.</p>

<p>Why the lovers are parted, why Gregory winna come to the lass,
and she must go to him, is not accounted for in
<b>C</b>-<b>G</b>. We may deduce from <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>,
though the story in these versions as we have it is not
altogether consistent, that the lass was banished from kith and
kin on account of her connection with Gregory (which in <b>B</b>
16 and <b>H</b> 9 is said to have been irregular) and flying to
her lover, found no acceptance with his mother.</p>

<p>Cunningham has rewritten this ballad, Scottish Songs, I, 298,
and several songs have been composed on the story: by Burns and
Dr. Wolcott (Peter Pindar), Thomson's Select Melodies of
Scotland, I, 37, ed. 1822; Jamieson, Popular Ballads, I, 46; and
by an anonymous writer in a London periodical, cited by Dixon,
Scottish Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads, p. 99.</p>

<p>Roch- or Rough-royal, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,
Ruchlawhill, <b>C</b>, I have not found, but there is a Rough
castle in Stirlingshire. Loch Ryan runs up into the north-west
corner of Wigtown, a shire at the south-west extremity of
Scotland. Aughrim is in the county of Roscommon, Ireland.</p>

<p>As the mother in this ballad, feigning to be 
her son, requires the lady at the gate to legitimate herself by mentioning some of the tokens 
which have been exchanged between her and 
her lover, so in other ballads a wife demands 
conclusive proofs that a man claiming to be 
her long absent husband is what he pretends 
to be. E.g., some forms of the French ballad 
of 'Germaine:'</p>
