<p>This is one of the cases in which a remarkably fine ballad has
been worse preserved in Scotland than anywhere else. Without
light from abroad we cannot fully understand even so much as we
have saved, and <i>with</i> this light comes a keen regret for
what we have lost.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, from Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, is
found also in Motherwell's Manuscript, but without doubt was
derived from Buchan. Though injured by the commixture of foreign
elements, <b>A</b> has still much of the original story. <b>B</b>
has, on the contrary, so little that
<a name="Page_I_178"/>
distinctively and
exclusively belongs to this story that it might almost as well
have been put with the following ballad, '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_16.html">Sheath and Knife</a>,' as
here. A third ballad, 'The Birth of Robin Hood,' preserves as
much of the story as <b>A</b>, but in an utterly incongruous and
very modern setting, being, like '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_8.html">Erlinton</a>,' <b>C</b>, forced
into an absurd Robin Hood framework. The mixture of four-line
with two-line stanzas in A of course comes from different ballads
having been blended, but for all that, these ballads might have
had the same theme. Stanzas 33-35, however, are such as we meet
with in ballads of the '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_7.html">Earl Brand</a>' class, but not in those of
the class to which 'Leesome Brand' belongs. In the English
ballads, and nearly all the Danish, of the former class, there is
at least a conversation between son and mother [father], whereas
in the other the catastrophe excludes such a possibility. Again,
the "unco land" in the first stanza, "where winds never blew nor
cocks ever crew," is at least a reminiscence of the paradise
depicted in the beginning of many of the versions of 'Ribold and
Guldborg,' and stanza 4 of 'Leesome Brand' closely resembles
stanza 2 of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_7.html">Earl Brand</a>,' <b>A</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d015_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Still, the first and
fourth stanzas suit one ballad as well as the other, which is not
true of 33-35.</p>

<p>The name Leesome Brand may possibly be a corruption of
Hildebrand, as Earl Brand almost certainly is; but a more likely
origin is the Gysellannd of one of the kindred Danish ballads.</p>

<p>The white hind, stanzas 28, 30, is met with in no other ballad
of this class, and, besides this, the last four stanzas are in no
kind of keeping with what goes before, for the "young son" is
spoken of as having been first brought home at some previous
period. Grundtvig has suggested that the hind and the blood came
from a lost Scottish ballad resembling The Maid Transformed into
a Hind,' <b>D</b>. <b>g</b>. F, <b>N</b>o 58. In this ballad a
girl begs her brother, who is going hunting, to spare the little
hind that "plays before his foot." The brother nevertheless
shoots the hind, though not mortally, and sets to work to flay
it, in which process he discovers his sister under the hind's
hide. His sister tells him that she had been successively changed
into a pair of scissors, a sword, a hare, a hind, by her
step-mother, and that she was not to be free of the spell until
she had drunk of her brother's blood. Her brother at once cuts
his fingers, gives her some of his blood, and the girl is
permanently restored to her natural shape, and afterwards is
happily married. Stanzas similar to 36-41 of <b>A</b> and 12-16
of <b>B</b> will be found in the ballad which follows this, to
which they are especially well suited by their riddling
character; and I believe that they belong there, and not here. It
is worthy of remark, too, that there is a hind in another ballad,
closely related to No 16 '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_50.html">The Bonny Hind</a>'), and that the hind in
'Leesome Brand' may, in some way not now explicable, have come
from this. The confounding of 'Leesome Brand' with a ballad of
the 'Bonny Hind' class would be paralleled in Danish, for in
'Redselille og Medelvold' <b>T</b> (and perhaps <b>I</b>, see
Grundtvig's note, v, 237), the knight is the lady's brother.</p>

<p>The "auld son" in <b>B</b>, like the first bringing home of the
young son in <b>A</b> 45, 47, shows how completely the proper
story has been lost sight of. There should be no son of any
description at the point at which this stanza comes in, and auld
son should everywhere be young son. The best we can do, to make
sense of stanza 3, is to put it after 8, with the understanding
that woman and child are carried off for burial; though really
there is no need to move them on that account. The shooting of
the child is unintelligible in the mutilated state of the ballad.
It is apparently meant to be an accident. Nothing of the kind
occurs in other ballads of the class, and the divergence is
probably a simple corruption.</p>

<p>The ballad which 'Leesome Brand' represents is preserved among
the Scandinavian races under four forms.</p>

<p><b>Danish</b>. <b>I</b>. 'Bolde Hr. Nilaus' L&ouml;n,' a

some sixty are collated, and some twenty-five printed, by

<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, the last, which is the oldest, being from
late in the 17th century; also the first stanza of a fourth,
<b>D</b>.</p>

<p>All the Scandinavian versions are in two-line stanzas save
Danish 272 <b>B</b>, and <b>A</b> in part, and Icelandic 17
<b>C</b>, which are in four; the last, however, in stanzas of two
couplets.</p>

<p>It will be most convenient to give first a summary of the
story of 'Redselille og Medelvold,' and to notice the chief
divergences of the other ballads afterwards. A mother and her
daughter are engaged in weaving gold tissue. The mother sees milk
running from the girl's breasts, and asks an explanation. After a
slight attempt at evasion, the daughter confesses that she has
been beguiled by a knight. The mother threatens both with
punishment: he shall be hanged [burned, broken on the wheel, sent
out of the country, i.e., sold into servitude], and she sent away
[broiled on a gridiron, burned, drowned]. Some copies begin
further back, with a stanza or two in which we are told that the
knight has served in the king's court, and gained the favor of
the king's daughter. Alarmed by her mother's threats, the maid
goes to her lover's house at night, and after some difficulty in
effecting an entrance (a commonplace, like the ill-boding milk
above) informs him of the fate that awaits them. The knight is
sufficiently prompt now, and bids her get her gold together while
he saddles his horse. They ride away, with [or without]
precautions against discovery, and come to a wood. Four Norwegian
versions, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, and also two
Icelandic versions, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, of 'S&oslash;nnens Sorg,'
interpose a piece of water, and a difficulty in crossing, owing to
the ferryman's refusing help or the want of oars; but this
passage is clearly an infiltration from a different story.
Arriving at the wood, the maid desires to rest a while. The
customary interrogation does not fail, &mdash; whether the way is too
long or the saddle too small. The knight lifts her off the horse,
spreads his cloak for her on the grass, and she gives way to her
anguish in such exclamations as "My mother had nine women: would
that I had the worst of them!" "My mother would never have been
so angry with me but she would have helped me in this strait!"
Most of the Danish versions make the knight offer to bandage his
eyes and render such service as a man may; but she replies that
she would rather die than that man should know of woman's pangs.
So Swedish <b>H</b>, nearly. Partly to secure privacy, and partly
from thirst, she expresses a wish for water, and her lover goes
in search of some.
<a name="Page_I_180"/>
(This in nearly all the Danish ballads, and
many of the others. But in four of the Norwegian versions of
'S&oslash;nnens Sorg' the lover is told to go and amuse himself,
much as in our ballads.) When he comes to the spring or the
brook, there sits a nightingale and sings. Two nightingales, a
small bird, a voice from heaven, a small dwarf, an old man,
replace the nightingale in certain copies, and in others there is
nothing at all; but the great majority has a single nightingale,
and, as Grundtvig points out, the single bird is right, for the
bird is really a vehicle for the soul of the dead Redselille. The
nightingale sings, "Redselille lies dead in the wood, with two
sons [son and daughter] in her bosom." All that the nightingale
has said is found to be true. According to Danish <b>O</b> and
Swedish <b>C</b>, the knight finds the lady and a child,
according to Swedish <b>B</b> and Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, the lady and two sons, dead. In Danish <b>B</b>,
<b>L</b> (as also the Icelandic 'Sonar Harmur,' <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, and Danish 'Stalbroders Kvide,' <b>A</b>) the knight
digs a grave, and lays mother and children in it; he lays himself
with them in <b>A</b> and <b>M</b>. It is not said whether the
children are dead or living, and the point would hardly be raised
but for what follows. In Danish<b>D</b>, <b>P</b> and Swedish
<b>F</b>, it is expressly mentioned that the children are
<i>alive</i>, and in <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>,
<b>U</b>, six copies of <b>V</b>, and <b>Y</b>, and also in
'Bolde Hr. Nilaus' L&oslash;n,' and in 'S&ouml;nnens Sorg,'
Danish <b>A</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, the
children are heard, or seem to be heard, shrieking from under the
ground. Nearly all the versions make the knight run himself
through with his sword, either immediately after the others are
laid in the grave, or after he has ridden far and wide, because he
cannot endure the cries of the children from under the earth.
This would seem to be the original conclusion of the story; the
horrible circumstance of the children being buried alive is much
more likely to be slurred over or omitted at a later day than to
be added.</p>

<p>We may pass over in silence the less important variations in
the very numerous versions of 'Redselille and Medelvold,' nor
need we be detained long by the other three Scandinavian forms of
the ballad. S&oslash;nnens Sorg' stands in the same relation to
'Redselille and Medelvold' as 'Hildebrand and Hilde,' does to
'Ribold and Guldborg' (see p. 89 of this volume); that is, the
story is told in the first person instead of the third. A father
asks his son why he is so sad, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, Icelandic <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>. Five years has he sat at his father's board, and never
uttered a merry word. The son relates the tragedy of his life. He
had lived in his early youth at the house of a nobleman, who had
three daughters. He was on very familiar terms with all of them,
and the youngest loved him. When the time came for him to leave
the family, she proposed that he should take her with him, Danish
<b>B</b>, Icelandic <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> [he makes the
proposal in Norwegian <b>C</b>]. From this point the narrative is
much the same as in 'Redselille and Medelvold,' and at the
conclusion he falls dead in his father's arms [at the table],
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, Icelandic <b>A</b>. The
mother takes the place of the father in Danish <b>B</b> and
Swedish, and perhaps it is the mother who tells the story in
English <b>A</b>, but the bad condition of the text scarcely
enables us to say. Danish <b>B</b> and the Swedish copy have lost
the middle and end of the proper story: there is no wood, no
childbirth, no burial. The superfluous boat of some Norwegian
versions of 'Redselille' reappears in these, and also in
Icelandic <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; it is overturned in a storm, and
the lady is drowned.</p>

<p>'Stalbroders Kvide' differs from 'S&oslash;nnens Sorg' only in
this: that the story is related to a comrade instead of father or
mother.</p>

<p>'Bolde Hr. Nilaus' L&oslash;n,' which exists but in a single
copy, has a peculiar beginning. Sir Nilaus has served eight years
in the king's court without recompense. He has, however, gained
the favor of the king's daughter, who tells him that she is
suffering much on his account. If this be so, says Nilaus, I will
quit the land with speed. He is told to wait till she has spoken
to her mother. She goes to her mother and says: Sir Nilaus has
served eight years; and had no reward; he desires the best that
it is in your power to give. The queen exclaims, He shall never
have my only
<a name="Page_I_181"/>
daughter's hand! The young lady immediately bids
Nilaus saddle his horse while she collects her gold, and from
this point we have the story of Redselille.</p>

<p><b>Dutch</b>. Willems, Oude vlaemsche Liederen, p. 482, No
231, 'De Ruiter en Mooi Elsje;' Hoffmann v. Fallersleben,
Niederl&auml;ndische Volkslieder, 2d ed., p. 170, No 75:
broadside of the date 1780.</p>

<p>A mother inquires into her daughter's condition, and learns
that she is going with child by a trooper (he is called both
'ruiter' and 'landsknecht'). The conversation is overheard by the
other party, who asks the girl whether she will ride with him or
bide with her mother. She chooses to go with him, and as they
ride is overtaken with pains. She asks whether there is not a
house where she can rest. The soldier builds her a hut of
thistles, thorns, and high stakes, and hangs his cloak over the
aperture. She asks him to go away, and to come back when he hears
a cry: but the maid was dead ere she cried. The trooper laid his
head on a stone, and his heart brake with grief.</p>

<p><b>German</b>. <b>A</b>, Simrock,.No 40, p. 92, 'Von Farbe so
bleich,' from Bonn and Rheindorf, repeated in Mittler, No 194.
The mother, on learning her daughter's plight, imprecates a curse
on her. The maid betakes herself to her lover, a trooper, who
rides off with her. They come to a cool spring, and she begs for
a fresh drink, but, feeling very ill, asks if there is no hamlet
near, from which she could have woman's help. The aid of the
trooper is rejected in the usual phrase, and he is asked to go
aside, and answer when called. If there should be no call, she
will be dead. There was no call, and she was found to be dead,
with two sons in her bosom. The trooper wrapped the children in
her apron, and dug her grave with his sword. <b>B</b>,
Reifferscheid, Westf&auml;lische Volkslieder, p. 106, 'Ach Wunder
&uuml;ber Wunder,' from B&ouml;kendorf: much the same as to the
story. <b>C</b>, Mittler, No 195, p. 175, 'Von Farbe so bleich,' a
fragment of a copy from Hesse; Zuccalmaglio, p. 187, No 90, 'Die
Waisen,' an entire copy, ostensibly from the Lower Rhine, but
clearly owing its last fourteen stanzas to the editor. The
trooper, in this supplements leaves the boys with his mother, and
goes over seas. The boys grow up, and set out to find their
father. In the course of their quest, they pass a night in a hut
in a wood, and are overheard saying a prayer for their father and
dead mother, by a person who announces herself as their maternal
grandmother! After this it is not surprising that the father
himself should turn up early the next morning. The same editor,
under the name of Montanus, gives in Die deutschen Volksfeste, p.
45 f, a part of this ballad again, with variations which show his
hand beyond a doubt. We are here informed that the ballad has
above a hundred stanzas, and that the conclusion is that the
grandmother repents her curse, makes her peace with the boys, and
builds a convent.</p>

<p><b>French</b>. Bujeaud, Chants et Chansons populaires des
provinces de l'Ouest, <b>A</b>, 1, 198, <b>B</b>, 200, 'J'entends
le rossignolet.' <b>A</b>. This ballad has suffered injury at the
beginning and the end, but still preserves very well the chief
points of the story. A lover has promised his mistress that after
returning from a long absence he would take her to see his
country. While traversing a wood she is seized with her pains.
The aid of her companion is declined: "Cela n'est point votre
metier." She begs for water. The lover goes for some, and meets a
lark, who tells him that he will find his love dead, with a child
in her arms. Two stanzas follow which are to no purpose.
<b>B</b>. The other copy of this ballad has a perverted instead
of a meaningless conclusion, but this keeps some traits that are
wanting in <b>A</b>. It is a two-line ballad, with the
nightingale in the refrain: "J'entends le rossignolet." A fair
maid, walking with her lover, falls ill, and lies down under a
thorn. The lover asks if he shall go for her mother. "She would
not come: she has a cruel heart." Shall I go for mine? "Go, like
the swallow!" He comes back and finds his love dead, and says he
will die with his mistress. The absurd conclusion follows that
she was feigning death to test his love.</p>

<p>The names in the Scandinavian ballads, it
<a name="Page_I_182"/>
is remarked by
Grundtvig, v, 242, 291, are not Norse, but probably of German
derivation, and, if such, would indicate a like origin for the
story. The man's name, for instance, in the Danish
'S&oslash;nnens Sorg,' <b>A</b>, Gysellannd, seems to point to
Gisalbrand or Gisalbald, German names of the 8th or 9th century.
There is some doubt whether this Gysellannd is not due to a
corruption arising in the course of tradition (see Grundtvig, v,
302); but if the name may stand, it will account for our Leesome
Brand almost as satisfactorily as .Hildebrand does for Earl Brand
in No 7.</p>

<p>The passage in which the lady refuses male assistance during
her travail &mdash; found as well in almost all the Danish
versions of Redselille and Medelvold,' in the German and French,
and imperfectly in Swedish <b>D</b> &mdash; occurs in several
other English ballads, viz., 'The Birth of Robin Hood,' '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_103.html">Rose the Red and White Lily</a>,'
'Sweet Willie,' of Finlay's Scottish
Ballads, 61, 'Burd Helen,' of Buchan, II, 30, '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_24.html">Bonnie Annie</a>,' No
23. Nearly the whole of the scene in the wood is in
'Wolfdietrich.' Wolfdietrich finds a dead man and a woman naked
to the girdle, who is clasping the stem of a tree. The man, who
was her husband, was taking her to her mother's house, where her
first child was to be born, when he was attacked by the dragon
Schadesam. She was now in the third day of her travail.
Wolfdietrich, having first wrapped her in his cloak, offers his
help, requesting her to tear a strip from her shift and bind it
round his eyes. She rejects his assistance in this form, but
sends him for water, which he brings in his helmet, but only to
find the woman dead, with a lifeless child at her breast. He wraps
mother and child in his mantle, carries them to a chapel, and
