<p>Printed in Dryden's Miscellany, VI, 346, ed. 1716; A
Collection of Old Ballads, 1723, I, 64; Ritson's Robin Hood,
179,5, II, 1 (a); Evans, Old Ballads, 1777, 1784, I, 86.</p>

<p>The jocular author of this ballad, who would certainly have
been diverted by any one's supposing him to write under the
restraints of tradition, brings Adam Bell, Clim, and Cloudesly
into company with Robin Hood's father. So again the silly Second
Part of Adam Bell in one of the copies, that of 1616. Robin
Hood's father's bow, st. 3, carried two north-country miles and
an inch. The son, then, was only half his father, though, in
Ritson's words, "Robin Hood and Little John have frequently shot
an arrow a measured mile."</p>

<p>Robin Hood's mother was niece to Guy of Warwick, and sister to
Gamwel of Gamwel Hall. In Robin Hood newly Revived, Young Gamwel
is Robin Hood's sister's son. According to this ballad, Robin
Hood goes with his mother to keep Christmas with old Gamwell, his
uncle, whose seat is forty miles from Locksly town. Little John
is a member of the household, a fine lad at gambols and juggling,
and twenty such tricks. Robin Hood, however, puts Little John
down in this way, and everybody else. His uncle is so much
pleased that he tells Robin he shall be his heir, and no more go
home. Robin asks the boon that Little John may be his page. All
the while, for how long we know not, Robin Hood has had his band
of yeomen in Sherwood. Thither he goes (the time is not
specified, but birds are singing in st. 50), and while he is
collecting his men, Clorinda, queen of the shepherds and
archeress, passes, and arrests his attention. The favorable
impression which she makes at first sight is confirmed by her
presently shooting a deer through side and side. Robin takes her
to his bower for a refection, which is served by four-and-twenty
yeomen. She inquires his name; he gives it, and asks her to be
his bride. After a blush and a pause, Clorinda says, With all my
heart, and it is no wonder that Robin proposes to send for a
priest immediately. Clorinda is, however, engaged to go to
Titbury feast, whither she invites Robin to keep her company. On
the way he has an affray with eight yeomen, who bid him hand over
the buck which Clorinda had killed, and which he is somehow
taking along with him. With Little John's help, five of the eight
are killed; the rest are spared. A bull-baiting is going on at
Titbury, which one wonders that a person of Clorinda's imputed
"wisdom and modesty" should care for; but somehow Clorinda throws
off her dignity in the 45th stanza. After dinner the parson is
sent for, the marriage ceremony is performed, and Robin and
Clorinda return to Sherwood.</p>

<p>The author of this ballad ("the most beautiful and one of the
oldest extant" of the series, says the editor of the collection
of 1723) knew nothing of the Earl of Huntington and Matilda
Fitzwater, but represents Robin Hood as the son of a forester. In
everything except keeping Robin a yeoman, he writes "as the world
were now but to begin, antiquity forgot, custom not known;" but
poets in his day, to quote the critic of 1723, "were looked upon
like other Englishmen, born to live and write with freedom."</p>

<p>Concerning the bull-running at Tutbury, or Stutesbury,
Staffordshire (a hideously brutal custom, of long standing), a
compendium of antiquarian information is given by Gutch, II, 118.
Arthur a Bradley, a rollicking ballad of a Merry Wedding,
mentioned in stanza 46, is printed by Ritson, Robin Hood, 1795,
II, 210.</p>
