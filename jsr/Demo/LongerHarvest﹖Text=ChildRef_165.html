<h3>Sir John Butler</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Sir Iohn Butler,' Percy Manuscript, p. 427;
Hales and Furnivall, III, 205. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d16501.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>The subject of this ballad is the murder of a Sir John Butler
at Bewsey Hall, near Warrington, Lancashire.</p>

<p>The story, which may be imperfect at the beginning, is that a
party of men cross the moat in a leathern boat, and among them
William Savage is one of the first. Sir John Butler's daughter
Ellen wakens her father and tells him that his uncle Stanley is
within his hall. If that be true, says Sir John, a hundred pound
will not save me. Ellen goes down into the hall, and is asked
where her father is; she avers that he is ridden to London, but
the men know better, and search for him. Little Holcroft loses
his head in trying to keep the door of the room where Sir John
is; they enter, and call on him to yield. He will yield to his
uncle Stanley, but never to false Peter Legh. Ellen Butler calls
for a priest; William Savage says, He shall have no priest but my
sword and me. Lady Butler was at this time in London; had she
been at home she might have begged her husband's life of her good
brother John. She dreams that her lord is swimming in blood, and
long before day sets out for Bewsey Hall. On her way she learns
that her husband is slain, and the news impels her to go back to
London, where she begs of the king the death of false Peter Legh,
her brother Stanley, William Savage, and all. Would ye have three
men to die for one? says the king; if thou wilt come to London,
thou shalt go home Lady Gray.</p>

<p>The papers of Roger Dodsworth,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d165_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> the antiquarian (&#8224;
16..), give the following account of the transaction, according
to the tradition of his time. "Sir John Boteler, Knight, was
slaine in his bed by the Lord Standley's procurement, Sir Piers
Leigh and Mister William Savage joininge with him in that action,
curruptinge his servants, his porter settinge a light in a
windowe to give knowledge upon the water that was about his house
at Bewsaye, when the watch that watched about his howse at
Bewsaye, where your way to ... [<i>i.e.</i> Bold] comes, were
gone awaye to their owne homes; and then they came over the moate
in lether boates, and soe to his chambre, where one of his
servants, called Hontrost [Holcroft], was slaine, being his
chamberlaine; the other brother betrayed his master. They
promised him a great reward, and he going with them a way, they
hanged him at a tree in Bewsaye Park. After this Sir John
Boteler's lady pursued those that slewe her husband, and indyted
xx. men for that 'saute,' but being marryed to Lorde Gray, he
made her suites voyd, for which cause she parted from her
husband, the Lorde Graye, and came into Lancastershyre, and sayd,
If my lord wyll not helpe me that I may have my wyll of mine
enemies, yet my bodye shall be berryed by him; and she caused a
tombe of alabaster to be made, where she lyeth upon the right
hand of her husband, Sir John Butler."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d165_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Another paper in the same collection assumes to give the cause
of the murder. "The occasion of the murther was this. The king
being to come to Lathom, the Erie of Derby, his brother-in-law,
sent unto hym [Sir John Butler] a messenger to desire him to wear
his cloath [appear as his retainer] at that tyme; but in his
absence his lady said she scorned that her husband should way te
on her brother, being as well able to entertayne Mie kynge as he
was; which answer the erle tooke in great disdayne, and
persecuted the said Sir John Butler with all the mallice that
cowd be." After mutual ill-services, they took arms one against
the other, Sir Piers Legh and William Savage siding with the
earl, and in the end these three corrupted Sir John Butler's
servants and murdered him in his bed. "Hys lady, at that instant
being in London, did dreame the same night that he was slayne,
that Bewsaye Hall did swym with blood; whereupon she presently
came homewards, and heard by the way the report of his
death."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d165_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Sir John Boteler, son of Sir John, born in 1429, married for
his third wife Margaret Stanley, widow of Sir Thomas Troutbeck,
daughter of Thomas first Lord Stanley, and sister of Thomas the
second lord, whom Dodsworth calls by anticipation Earl of Derby,
which he was not until 1485. Sir John Boteler had by his first
wife four daughters, but no Ellen; by Margaret Stanley he had a
son Thomas, born in 1461. He died in 1463, and his wife
afterwards married for her third husband Henry Lord Grey of
Codnor.</p>

<p>According to st. 23 of the ballad, Dame Margaret's brother
Stanley, that is Lord Thomas, is directly concerned in the murder
which in the Dods worth story he is said only to have procured.
But an uncle Stanley appears to be a prominent member of the
hostile party in sts 5, 12; how, we cannot explain. A 'good'
brother John is mentioned in st. 15, of whom Lady Butler might
have begged her husband's life, and who must, therefore, have
been present. Lady Butler had a brother John. But the alleged
participation of Sir Peter Legh and William Savage in this
murder, perpetrated in 1463, is an impossibility. Sir Peter Legh
was born in 1455, and was only eight years old at that time, and
William Savage, nephew of Lord Thomas Stanley, was also a mere
child. As to the part ascribed to Lord Thomas Stanley, Sir Thomas
Butler, the son of Sir John, is said to have lived on the most
friendly terms with him in after days, and to have limited " an
estate in remainder, after the limitation to himself and his
heirs, to the Earl of Derby in fee," which we can hardly suppose
he would have done if the earl had been his father's murderer.</p>

<p>The occasion of the murder is represented in the tradition
reported by Dodsworth to have been Sir John Butler's refusal
(through his wife) to wear the Earl of Derby's livery at the time
of the king's coming to Lathom. The king (Henry VII) did indeed
come to Lathom, but not until the year 1495, thirty-two years
after Sir John's death, and three years after that of his wife.
It is true that other accounts make Sir Thomas, the son of Sir
John, to have been the victim of the murder; but Sir Thomas died
in 1522, and the Earl of Derby in 1504.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d165_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> There is not, as Dr.
Robson says, a tittle of evidence to show that there was any
murder at all, whether of Sir John or any other of the Butler
family. But it was an unquiet time, and the conjecture has been
offered "that, being a consistent Lancastrian," Sir John "may
have incurred some Yorkist resentments, and have been sacrificed
by a confederacy of some of those who, though his private
friends, were his political enemies."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d165_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Sir John Butler, son of Sir John, is of course the only person
that the ballad and the parallel tradition can intend, for
Margaret Stanley was the only Stanley that ever married a Butler,
and Margaret Stanley's third husband was Lord Grey of Codnor. But
Sir John the elder, who died in 1430, had a daughter Ellen, "old
enough to raise an alarm when her father was attacked, while he
was actually nephew by marriage to the second Sir John Stanley of
Lathom, who survived him." (If we might proceed according to
established mythological rules, and transfer to the son what is
told of the father, we might account for the "uncle Stanley" and
the Ellen of the ballad.) Sir John the senior's widow, Lady
Isabella, was in 1437 violently carried off and forced into
marriage by one William Poole, and her petition to Parliament for
redress calls this Poole an outlaw "for felony for man's death by
him murdered and slain." It has been thought a not overstrained
presumption that this language may refer to the death of Lady
Isabella's husband, the earlier Sir John, though it would be
strange, if such were the reference, that no name should be
given.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d165_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The Bewsey murder has been narrated, with the variations of
later tradition, by John Fitchett in 'Bewsey, a Poem,'
Warrington, 1796; in a ballad by John Roby, Traditions of
Lancashire, 1879, II, 72; and in another ballad in Ballads and
Songs of Lancashire, Harland and Wilkinson, 1882, p. 13 (at p. 15
Fitchett's verses are cited). See also Dr. Robson, in the preface
to the Percy ballad, p. 208, and Bearaont, Annals of the Lords of
Warrington, p. 318.</p>
