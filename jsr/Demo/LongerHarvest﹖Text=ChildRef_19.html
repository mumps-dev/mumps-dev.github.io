<h3>King Orfeo</h3>

<a name="Page_I_215"/>
<ol type="A">
<li>The Leisure Hour, February 14, 1880, No 1468: Folk-Lore from
Unst, Shetland, by Mrs. Saxby, p. 109. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d01901.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Mr. Edmondston, from whose memory this ballad was derived,
notes that though stanzas are probably lost after the first which
would give some account of the king in the east wooing the lady
in the west, no such verses were sung to him. He had forgotten
some stanzas after the fourth, of which the sub stance was that
the lady was carried off by fairies; that the king went in quest
of her, and one day saw a company passing along a hill side,
among whom he recognized his lost wife. The troop went to what
seemed a great "ha-house," or castle, on the hillside. Stanzas
after the eighth were also forgotten, the purport being that a
messenger from behind the grey stane appeared and invited the
king in.</p>

<p>We have here in traditional song the story of the justly
admired mediaeval romance of Orpheus, in which fairy-land
supplants Tartarus, faithful love is rewarded, and Eurydice
(Heurodis, Erodys, Eroudys) is retrieved. This tale has come down
to us in three versions: <b>A</b>, in the Auchinleck Manuscript,
dating from the beginning of the fourteenth century, Advocates
Library, Edinburgh, printed in Laing's Select Remains of the
Ancient Popular Poetry of Scotland, 'Orfeo and Heurodis,' No 3;
<b>B</b>, Ashmole Manuscript, 61, Bodleian Library, of the first
half of the fifteenth century, printed in Halliwell's
Illustrations of Fairy Mythology, 'Kyng Orfew,' p. 37; C,
Harleian Manuscript, 3810, British Museum, printed by Ritson,
Metrical Romancees, II, 248, 'Sir Orpheo.' At the end of the
Auchinleck copy we are told that harpers in Britain heard this
marvel, and made a lay thereof, which they called, after the
king, 'Lay Orfeo.' The other two copies also, but in verses which
are a repetition of the intro duction to 'Lay le Freine,' call
this a Breton lay.</p>

<p>The story is this (<b>A</b>). Orfeo was a king [and so good a
harper never none was, <b>B</b>]. One day in May his queen went
out to a garden with two maidens, and fell asleep under an "ympe"
tree. When she waked she shrieked, tore her clothes, and acted
very wildly. Her maidens ran to the palace and called for help,
for the queen would go mad. Knights and ladies went to the queen,
took her away, and put her to bed; but still the excitement
continued. The king, in great affliction, besought her to tell
him what was the matter, and what he could do. Alas! she said, I
have loved thee as my life, and thou me, but now we must part. As
she slept knights had come to her and had bidden her come speak
with they king. Upon her refusal, the king himself came, with a
company of knights and damsels, all on snow-white steeds, and
made her ride on a palfrey by his side, and, after he had shown
her his palace, brought her back and said: Look thou be under
this ympe tree tomorrow, to go with us; and if thou makest us any
let, we will take thee by force, wherever thou be. The next day
Orfeo took the queen to the tree under guard of a thousand
knights, all resolved to die before they would give her up: but
she was spirited away right from the midst of them, no one knew
whither.</p>

<p>The king all but died of grief, but it was no boot. He gave
his kingdom in charge to his high steward, told his barons to
choose a new king when they should learn that he was dead, put on
a sclavin and nothing else, took his harp, and went barefoot out
at the gate. Ten years he lived in the woods and on the heath;
his body wasted away, his beard grew to his girdle. His only
solace was in his harp, and, when the weather was bright, he
would play, and all the beasts and birds would flock to him.
Often at hot noon-day he would see the king of fairy hunting with
his rout, or an armed host would go by him with banners
displayed, or knights and ladies would come dancing; but whither
they went he could not tell. One day he descried sixty ladies who
were hawking. He went towards them and saw that one of them was
Heurodis. He looked at her wistfully, and she at him; neither
spoke a word, but tears fell from her eyes, and the ladies
hurried her away. He followed, and spared neither stub nor stem.
They went in at a rock, and he after. They alighted at a superb
castle; he knocked at the gate, told the porter he was a
minstrel, and was let in. There he saw Heurodis, sleeping under
an ympe tree.</p>

<p>Orfeo went into the hall, and saw a king and queen, sitting in
a tabernacle. He kneeled down before the king. What man art thou?
said the king. I never sent for thee, and never found I man so
bold as to come here unbidden. Lord, quoth Orfeo, I am but a poor
minstrel, and it is a way of ours to seek many a lord's house,
though we be not welcome. Without more words he took his harp and
began to play. All the palace came to listen, and lay down at his
feet. The king sat still and was glad to hear, and, when the
harping was done, said, Minstrel, ask of me whatever it be; I
will pay thee largely. "Sir," said Orfeo, "I be seech thee give
me the lady that sleepeth under the ympe tree." "Nay," quoth the
king,
<a name="Page_I_217"/>
"ye were a sorry couple; for thou art lean and rough and
black, and she is lovely and has no lack. A lothly thing were it
to see her in thy company." "Gentle king," replied the harper, it
were a fouler thing to hear a lie from thy mouth." "Take her,
then, and be blithe of her," said the king.</p>

<p>Orfeo now turned homewards, but first presented himself to the
steward alone, and in beggar's clothes, as a harper from
heathendom, to see if he were a true man. The loyal steward was
ready to welcome every good harper for love of his lord. King
Orfeo made himself known; the steward threw over the table, and
fell down at his feet, and so did all the lords. They brought the
queen to the town. Orfeo and Heurodis were crowned anew, and
lived long afterward.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian burden was, perhaps, no more intelligible to
the singer than "Hey non nonny" is to us. The first line seems to
be Unst for Danish</p>

<p>Skoven &aring;rle gr&ouml;n (Early green 's the wood).</p>

<p>The sense of the other line is not so obvious. 
Professor Grundtvig has suggested to me,</p>

<p>Hvor hjorten ban g&aring;r &aring;rlig (Where the hart goes 
yearly).</p>
