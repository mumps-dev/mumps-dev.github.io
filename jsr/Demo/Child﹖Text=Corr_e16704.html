<p>'The Sonnge of Sir Andraye Barton, Knight,' English
Miscellanies, edited by James Raine, Surtees Society, vol. lxxxv,
p. 64, 1890; from a Manuscript in a hand of the sixteenth century
now in York Minster Library.</p>

<p>This very interesting version of Sir Andrew Barton, the editor
informs us, was originally No 25 of a ballad-book in small
quarto. It came recently "into the possession of the Dean and
Chapter of York with a number of papers which belonged in the
seventeenth century to the episcopal families of Lamplugh and
Davenant." If, as is altogether probable, there were copies of
other ballads in the same book in quality as good as this, and
if, as is equally probable, no more of the book can be recovered,
our only comfort is the cold one of having had losses. In several
details this copy differs from that of the Percy Manuscript, but
not more than would be expected. The English sail out of the
Thames on the morrow after midsummer month, July 1, and come back
the night before St. Maudlen's eve, or the night of July 20,
stanzas 17, 74. In stanza 42 Barton boasts that he had once sent
thirty Portingail heads home salted &mdash; 'to eat with bread'!
We read in Lesley's History that the Hollanders had taken and
spoiled divers Scots ships, and had cruelly murdered and cast
overboard the merchants and passengers; in revenge for which
Andrew Barton took many ships of that country, and filled certain
pipes with the heads of the Hollanders and sent them to the
Scottish king. (Ed. 1830, p. 74; ed. 1578, p. 329.) The eating is
a ferocious addition of the ballad. Several passages of this copy
are corrupted. <b>A</b> throws light upon some of these places,
but others remain to me unamendable.</p>
