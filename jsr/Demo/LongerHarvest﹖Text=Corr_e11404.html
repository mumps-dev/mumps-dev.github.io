<h3>114. Johnie Cock</h3>


<p>P. 1. There is a ballad of 'Bertram, the Bauld Archer' in
Pitcairn's Manuscripts, III, 51; printed in Maidment's Scotish
Ballads and Songs, 1859, p. 46. Pitcairn derived it from Mrs.
McCorquodale, Stirling, a farmer's wife, who remembered it "to
have been sung by her grandmother, a woman above eighty years
old, who stated that she had it from an old woman, her aunt." The
reciter herself was above sixty-five, and had "first heard it
when a little girl." Nevertheless, Bertram is fustian, of a sort
all too familiar in the last century. The story, excepting
perhaps the first stanza, is put into the mouth of Bertram's
mistress, <i>&agrave; la</i> Gilderoy. The bauld archer has gone
to the forest for to mak a robberie. The king has made
proclamation that he will give five hunder merk for Bertram's
life. John o Shoumacnair (Stronmaknair, Maidment) proposes to his
billies to kill Bertram and get the money. They busk themselves
in hodden gray, 'like to friers o low degree,' present themselves
to Bertram and ask a boon of him, which Bertram grants without
inquiry. While they are parleying, Shoumacnair drives his dirk
into Bertram's back. But, though he swirls wi the straik, Bertram
draws his awsome bran, kills ane, wounds twa, and then his
stalwart, gallant soul takes its flight to heaven.</p>

<p>2 b. Braid. "This version ['Johnie of Braidisbank,' <b>I</b>]
was taken down by Motherwell and me from the recitation of Mr.
James Knox, land-surveyor at Tipperlinne, near Edinburgh, in the
month of May, 1824, when we met him in the good town of Paisley.
At 17 a tradition is mentioned which assigns Braid to have been
the scene of this woeful hunting. Mr. Knox is the authority for
this tradition. Braid is in the neighborhood of Tipperlinne."
Note by Mr. P.A. Ramsay in a copy of the Minstrelsy which had
belonged to Motherwell. (W. Macmath.)</p>

<p>Wolves in Scotland. "It is usually said that the species was
extirpated about 1680 by Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, but the
tradition to that effect appears to be true only of Sir Ewen's
own district of western Invernessshire." The very last wolf may
have been killed in 1743. R. Chambers, Domestic Annals of
Scotland, III, 690.</p>

<p>7. <b>F</b> was made up from several copies, one of which was
the following, 'John o Cockielaw,' in Scott's youthful
handwriting, inserted, as No 3, at the beginning of a Manuscript
volume, in small folio, containing a number of prose pieces, and
beginning with excerpts from Law's Memorials. Abbotsford Library,
