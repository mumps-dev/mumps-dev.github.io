<p>This piece was first printed by Buchan, in 1828, and all the
copies which have been re covered are of about that date. The
device of a lover's feigning death as a means of winning a shy
mistress enjoys a considerable popularity in European ballads.
Even more favorite is a ballad in which the woman adopts this
expedient, in order to escape from the control of her relations:
see '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_96.html">The Gay Goshawk</a>,' with which will be given another form of
the present story.</p>

<p>A Danish ballad answering to our Feigned Lyke-Wake is
preserved, as I am informed by Professor Grundtvig, in no less
than fourteen manuscripts, some of them of the 16th century, and
is still living in tradition. Five versions, as yet unprinted,
<b>A</b>-<b>E</b>, have been furnished me by the editor of the
Ballads of Denmark.</p>

<p>A, from a manuscript of the sixteenth century. Young Herre
Karl asks his mother's rede how he may get the maid his heart is
set upon. She advises him to feign sickness, and be laid on his
bier, no one to know his counsel but the page who is to do his
errands. The page bids the lady to the wake that night. Little
Kirstin asks her mother's leave to keep wake over Karl. The wake
is to be in the upper room of Karl's house. The mother says, Be
on your guard; he means to cheat you; but Kirstin, neither
listening to her mother nor asking her father, goes to keep wake
in the upper room. When she went in she could not see the lights
for her tears. She begged all the good people to pray for Karl's
soul, sat down by his head and made her own prayer, and murmured,
While thou livedst I loved thee. She lifted the cloths, and there
lay Karl wide awake and laughing. "All the devils in hell receive
thy soul!" she cried. "If thou livedst a hundred years, thou
shouldst never have my good will!" Karl proposed that she
should pass the night with him. "Why would you deceive me!"
Kirstin exclaimed. "Why did you not go to my father and betroth
me honorably?" Karl immediately rode to her father's to do this,
and they were married.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. <b>a</b>, from Manuscripts of
1610 and later, almost
<a name="Page_I_248"/>
identical with <b>b</b>, 'Den forstilte
Vaagestue,' Levninger, Part II, 1784, p. 34, No 7.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d025_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This
version gives us some rather unnecessary previous history. Karl
has sued for Ingerlille three years, and had an ill answer. He
follows her to church one fine day, and, after mass, squeezes her
fingers and asks, Will you take pity on me? She replies, You must
ask my father and friends; and he, <b>J</b> have, and can get no
good answer. If you will give me your troth, we can see to that
best our selves. "Never," she says. "Farewell, then; but Christ
may change your mind." Karl meets his mother on his way from
church, who asks why he is so pale. He tells her his plight, and
is advised, as before, to use craft. The wake is held on Karl's
premises,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d025_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Ingerlille, in scarlet mantle, goes with her
maids. She avows her love, but adds that it was a fixed idea in
her mind that he would deceive her. She lifts up the white cloth
that covers the face. Karl laughs, and says, We were good friends
before, so are we still. Bear out the bier, and follow me to bed
with the fair maid. She hopes he will have respect for her honor.
Karl reassures her, leaves her with his mother, rides to
Ingerlille's house, obtains her parents' approbation, and buys
wine for his wedding.</p>

<p><b>C</b>, from manuscripts of the sixteenth century. Karl is
given out for dead, and his pages ride to the convent to ask that
his body may be laid in the cloister. The bier is borne in; the
prioress comes to meet it, with much respect. The pages go about
bidding maids to the wake. Ellin asks her mother if she may go.
(This looks as if there had originally been no convent in the
ballad.) Her mother tells her to put on red gold and be wary of
Karl, he is so very tricky. When Ellin owns her attachment, Karl
whispers softly, Do not weep, but follow me. Horses were ready at
the portal black horses all! Karl sprang from the bier, took
Ellin, and made for the door. The nuns, who stood read ing in the
choir, thought it was an angel that had translated her, and
wished one would come for them. Karl, with fifteen men who were
in waiting, carried Ellin home, and drank his bridal with her.</p>

<p><b>D</b>, from recent oral tradition. As Karl lay in his bed,
he said, How shall I get the fair maid out of the convent? His
foster-mother heard him, and recommended him to feign death and
bid the fair maid to his wake. The maid asked her father's leave
to go, but he said, Nay, the moment you are inside the door he
will seize you by the foot. But when the page, who had first come
in blue, comes back in scarlet, she goes. She stands at Karl's
head and says, I never shall forget thee; at his feet, "I wished
thee well; " at his side, "Thou wast my dearest." Then she turns
and bids everybody good-night, but Karl seizes her, and calls to
his friends to come drink his bridal. We hear nothing of the
convent after the first stanza.</p>

<p><b>E</b>, from oral tradition of another quarter. Karl
consults his mother how he shall get little Kirstin out of the
convent, and receives the same counsel. A page is sent to the
convent, and asks who will come to the wake now Herr Karl is
dead? Little Kirstin, with out application to the prioress, goes
to her mother, who does not forbid her, but warns her that Karl
will capture her as sure as she goes into the room.</p>

<p>The maid has the door by the handle,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And is wishing them all good-night;<br/>
Young Karl, that lay a corpse on the bier,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sprang up and held her tight.</p>

<p>'Why here 's a board and benches,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there 's no dead body here;<br/>
This eve I '11 drink my mead and wine,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All with my Kirstin dear.</p>

<a name="Page_I_249"/>
<p>'Why here 's a board and beds too,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here there 's nobody dead;<br/>
To-morrow will I go to the priest,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All with my plighted maid.'</p>

<p><b>F</b>, another copy from recent tradition, was published in
1875, in Kristensen's Jyske Folkeviser, II, 213, No 62,
'Vaagestuen.' There is no word of a convent here. The story is
made very short. Kirsten's mother says she will be fooled if she
goes to the wake. The last stanza, departing from all other
copies, says that when Kirsten woke in the morning Karl was
off.</p>

<p><b>G</b>. 'Klosterranet,' Levninger, I, 23, No 4 (1780),
Danske Viser, iv, 261, No 212, a very second-rate ballad, may
have the praise of preserving consistency and conventual
discipline. The young lady does not slip out to see her mother
without leave asked and had. It is my persuasion that the
convent, with its little jest about the poor nuns, is a later
invention, and that C is a blending of two different stories. In
<b>G</b>, Herr Morten betroths Proud Adeluds, who is more
virtuous than rich. His friends object; her friends do not want
spirit, and swear that she shall never be his. Morten's father
sends him out of the country, and Adeluds is put into a convent.
After nine years Morten returns, and, having rejected an
advantageous match proposed by his father, advises with his
brother, Herr Nilaus, how to get his true love out of the
cloister. The brother's plan is that of the mother and
foster-mother in the other versions. Herr Nilaus promises a rich
gift if Morten's body may be buried within the cloister. From
this point the story is materially the same as in <b>C</b>.</p>

<p><b>H</b>. A copy, which I have not yet seen, in Rahbek's
L&aelig;sning i blandede &AElig;mner (or Hesperus), m, 151, 1822
(Bergstr&ouml;m).</p>

<p>'Hertugen af Skage,' Danske Viser, II, 191, No 88, has this
slight agreement with the foregoing ballads. Voldemar, the king's
youngest son, hearing that the duke has a daughter, Hildegerd,
that surpasses all maids, seeks her out in a convent in which she
has taken refuge, and gets a cold reception. He feigns death,
desiring that his bones may repose in the cloister. His bier is
carried into the convent church. Hildegerd lights nine candles
for him, and expresses compassion for his early death. While she
is standing before the altar of the Virgin, Voldemar carries her
out of the church by force.</p>

<p>This, says Afzelius, 1814, is one of the commonest ballads in
Sweden, and is often represented as a drama by young people in
country places. <b>A</b> <b>a</b>, 'Herr Carl, eller
Klosterrofvet,' Afzelius, I, 179, No 26, new ed. No 24; <b>b</b>,
Afzelius, Sago-H&auml;fder, ed. 1851, IV, 106. <b>B</b>.
Atterbom, Poetisk Kalender for 1816, p. 63, 'Det lefvande Liket.'
<b>C</b>. Rancken, Nagra Prof af Folksang, o. s. v., p. 13, No 4.
These differ but slightly from Danish <b>D</b>, <b>B</b>. All
three conclude with the humorous verses about the nuns, which in
Rancken's copy take' this rollicking turn:</p>

<p>And all the nuns in the convent they all danced in a ring;<br/>
'Christ send another such angel, to take us all under his wing!'<br/>
And all the nuns in the convent, they all danced each her lone;<br/>
'Christ send another such angel, to take us off every one!'</p>

<p>Bergstr&ouml;m, new Afzelius, II, 131, refers to another
version in Gyllenmars' visbok, p. 191, and to a good copy
obtained by himself.</p>

<p>An Icelandic version for the 17th century, which is after the
fashion of Danish <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, is given in &Iacute;slenzk
Fornkv&aelig;&eth;i, II, 59, No 40, 'Marteins kvi&eth;a.' The
lover has in all three a troop of armed men in waiting outside of
the convent.</p>

<p>Professor Bugge has obtained a version in Norway, which,
however, is as to language essentially Danish. (Bergstr&ouml;m, as
above.)</p>

<p>There is a very gay and pretty south-European ballad, in which
the artifice of feigning death is successfully tried by a lover
after the failure of other measures.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. <b>Magyar</b>. Arany and Gyulai, I, 172, No 18,
'P&aacute;lbeli Sz&eacute;p Antal;' translated by
<a name="Page_I_250"/>
Aigner,
Ungarische Volksdichtungen, p. 80, 'Sch&ouml;n Anton.' Handsome
Tony tells his mother that he shall die for Helen. The mother
says, Not vet. I will build a marvellous mill. The first wheel
shall grind out pearls, the middle stone discharge kisses, the
third wheel distribute small change. The pretty maids will come
to see, and Helen among them. Helen asks her mother's leave to
see the mill. "Go not," the mother replies. "They are throwing
the net, and a fox will be caught." Tony again says he must die.
His mother says, not yet; for she will build an iron bridge; the
girls will come to see it, and Helen among them. Helen asks to
see the bridge; her mother answers as before. Tony says once more
that he shall die for Helen. His mother again rejoins, Not yet.
Make believe to be dead; the girls will come to see you, and
Helen among them. Helen entreats to be allowed to go to see the
hand some young man that has died. Her mother tells her she will
never come back. Tony's mother calls to him to get up; the girl
he was dying for is even now before the gate, in the court,
standing at his feet. "Never," says Helen, "saw I so handsome a
dead man, eyes smiling, mouth tempting kisses, and his feet all
ready for a spring." Up he jumped and embraced her.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. <b>Italian</b>. Ferraro, Canti popolari monferrini,
p. 59, No 40, 'Il Genovese.' The Genoese, not obtaining the
beautiful daughter of a rich merchant on demand, plants a garden.
All the girls come for flowers, except the one desired. He then
gives a ball, with thirty-two musicians. All the girls are there,
but not the merchant's daughter. He then builds a church, very
richly adorned. All the girls come to mass, all but one. Next he
sets the bells a ringing, in token of his death. The fair one
goes to the window to ask who is dead. The good people ("ra
bun-ha gent," in the Danish ballad "det gode folk") tell her that
it is her first love, and suggest that she should attend the
funeral. She asks her father, who consents if she will not cry.
As she was leaving the church, the lover came to life, and called
to the priests and friars to stop singing. They went to the high
altar to be married.</p>

<p><b>C</b>. <b>Slovenian</b>. Vraz, Narodne pe&#353;ni ilirske,
p. 93, '&#268;udna bolezen' ('Strange Sickness'); translated by
Anastasius Gr&uuml;n, Volkslieder aus Krain, p. 36, 'Der
Scheintodte.' "Build a church, mother," cries the love-sick
youth, "that all who will may hear mass; perhaps my love among
them." The mother built a church, one and another came, but not
his love. "Dig a well, mother, that those who will may fetch
water; perhaps my love among them." The well was dug, one and
another came for water, but not his love. "Say I am dead, mother,
that those who will may come to pray." Those who wished came, his
love first of all. The youth was peeping through the window.
"What kind of dead man is this, that stretches his arms for an
embrace, and puts out his mouth for a kiss?"</p>
