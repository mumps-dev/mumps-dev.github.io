<h3>A True Tale of Robin Hood</h3>

<p>Martin Parker's True Tale of Robin Hood was entered to Francis
Grove the 29th of February, 1632: Stationers' Registers, Arber,
IV, 273. A copy in the British Museum (press-mark C. 39. a. 52),
which is here reprinted, is assumed by Mr. W.C. Hazlitt,
Handbook, p. 439, and Mr. George Bullen, Brit. Mus. Catalogue, to
be of this first edition. The title of this copy is: A True Tale
of Robbin [Hood], or, A brief e touch of the life and death o[f
that] Renowned Outlaw, Robert Earle of Huntin[gton] vulgarly
called Robbin Hood, who lived and died in [A.D.] 1198, being the
9. yeare of the reigne of King Ric[hard] the first, commonly
called Richard Cuer de Lyon. Carefully collected out of the
truest Writers of our English C[hroni]cles. And published for the
satisfaction of those who desire to s[ee] Truth purged from
falsehood. By Martin Parker. Printed at London for T. Cotes, and
are to be sold by F. Grove dwellin[g] upon Snow-hill, neare the
Saracen[s head].<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d154_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Martin Parker professes in st. 117 to follow chronicles, not
"fained tales." Perhaps he regards broadside-ballads with
historical names in them as chronicles: at any rate, though he
reports some things which are found in Grafton, and in Major as
cited by Grafton, much the larger part of his True Tale is now to
be found only in ballads. When he does not agree with ballads
which have come down to us, he may have used earlier copies, or
he may have invented. The story of the abbot in 23-26 is at least
from the same source as Robin Hood and the Bishop; the plundering
of King Richard's receivers in 33 is evidently the same event as
that referred to in the first stanza of Robin Hood and Queen
Katherine; Robin Hood is said to have built eight almshouses in
71, and one in the last stanza of The Noble Fisherman. The Gest
could hardly have been unknown to Parker. Stanzas 3-9, concerning
Robin's rank, prodigality, and outlawry, may have been based upon
Munday's play; but nothing is said of Maid Marian. 44-50 and
56-65 may report the substance of some lost broadside.</p>

<p>Perhaps Parker calls his compilation a True Tale because a
tale of Robin Hood was a proverb for an incredible story: "Tales
of Robin Hood are good for fools."</p>
