<p>Christie, Traditional Ballad Airs, II, 34, I, 42, says that an
old woman in Buckie, Enzie, Banff, who died in 1866 at the age of
nearly eighty, and whose father was a noted ballad-singer, sang
him words which, so far as he could remember, were like those of
<b>B</b>.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Unmarried Burd Isabel bears a son to Earl Patrick.
He has passed his word to make her his wife in case the expected
bairn should be a boy, but his mother objects. He now promises to
bring her home after the demise of his parents, and in the mean
while builds her a gold and silver bower (which for a reason
inscrutable is 'strawn round wi sand'). Father and mother die;
Patrick takes no step to fulfil his engagement, and Isabel asks
why. Patrick wishes that a hundred evils may enter him, and he
'fa oure the brim,' if ever he marries another; nevertheless he
weds a duke's daughter. His bride has a fancy to see his son, and
Patrick sends his aunt (or his grand-aunt, or his
great-grand-aunt) to fetch the boy. Isabel dares any woman to
take the bairn away. Patrick comes in person. Isabel repeats the
words she had used to his aunt, and reminds him of the curse
which he had conditionally wished himself at their last
interview. The perjured man turns to go away, the hundred evils
enter him, and he falls 'oure the brim.'</p>

<p><b>B</b> has nearly the same story with additional
circumstances. Patrick wishes that eleven devils may attend his
last day should he wed another woman. When he goes to inquire how
Isabel came to refuse the request he had made through his aunt,
he takes the opportunity to make over to her child the third part
of his land. She has two clerks, her cousins, at her call, who
see to the legal formalities pertaining to this transfer; she
commits the boy to one of these, and herself goes to an unco land
to drive love out of her mind. We hear of nothing worse happening
to Earl Patrick for selling his precious soul than his never
getting further ben the church than the door.</p>

<p><b>C</b> is a variety of <b>B</b>, but not half so long.
Whether <b>B</b> has added or <b>C</b> omitted, no reader will
much concern himself to know.</p>

<p>St. 7 (nearly) occurs in No 92, <b>B</b> 17, II, 313, and
something similar in various ballads.</p>
