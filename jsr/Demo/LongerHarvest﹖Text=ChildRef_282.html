<h3>Jock the Leg and the Merry Merchant</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 165. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d28201.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Jock the Leg and a merchant (packman, pedlar) put up at the
same tavern. Jock makes free to order a good supper at the
merchant's expense; the packman gives notice that he will not pay
a penny beyond his own shot. They go to bed in rooms separated by
a locked door, but before the merchant is well asleep Jock
appears at his feet and rouses him; it is more than time that
they were on their road. The merchant will not stir a foot till
daylight; he cannot go by Barnisdale or Coventry for fear that
Jock the Leg should take his pack. His self-imposed comrade
promises to see him safely through these places, but when they
come to dangerous ground avows himself as Jock the Leg, and
demands the pack. The merchant puts his pack under a tree, and
says he will fight for it till daylight; they fight; the robber
finds a more than equal match, cries Hold! and begs the boon of a
blast on his horn, to which the merchant contemptuously accedes.
Four-and-twenty bowmen come to Jock's help. The merchant offers
to give up his pack if the six best of these, and Jock, the
seventh, can drive him one foot from it. The seven make the
attempt and fail. The merchant, holding his pack in one hand,
slays five of the six with his broadsword, and knocks over the
other.</p>

<p>Jock declares him to be the boldest swordsman he has ever
fought with; if he were equally good with the bow, he should have
service with Jock's master in the greenwood. The merchant would
not join a robber-band. Jock proposes a barter of deerskins for
fine linen. The merchant wants no stolen deerskins. 'Take your
pack,' says Jock, 'and wherever we meet we shall be good
comrades.' 'I'll take my pack,' says the uncompromising merchant,
'and wherever we meet I'll call thee a rank thief.'</p>

<p>This piece, but for names (and Jock the Leg is only a thin
shrouding for Little John), might have gone with the Robin Hood
ballads. It was composed, probably, in the last half of the
eighteenth century, and for hawkers' purposes, but it is a better
ballad, imitation as it is, than some of the seventeenth-century
broadsides of the same class (which is indeed saying very
little). The fight for the pack, 13, 14, 20, we have in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_132.html">The Bold Pedlar and Robin Hood</a>'
(also a late ballad), No 132, 6, 7, 10;
the "asking" of a blast on the horn and the scornful reply, 16,
17, in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_135.html">Robin Hood and the Shepherd</a>,' No 135, 15, 16, with verbal
similarity in the first case. (17 is all but a repetition of No
123, <b>B</b> 26, and No 140, <b>B</b> 25.)</p>
