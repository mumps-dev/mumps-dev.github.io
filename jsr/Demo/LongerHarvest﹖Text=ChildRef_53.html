<p><b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, and the fragment
<b>G</b> now appear for the first time in print, and the same is
true of <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, which are of less account.
<b>C</b> <b>a</b> is here given according to the manuscript,
without Jamieson's "collations." Of <b>E</b> and <b>C</b>
<b>b</b> Jamieson says: This ballad and that
<a name="Page_I_455"/>
which succeeds it

collated with two other copies procured from Scotland; one in
Manuscript; another, very good, one printed for the stalls; a
third, in the possession of the late Reverend Jonathan Boucher,
of Epsom, taken from recitation in the north of England; and a
fourth, about one third as long as the others, which the editor
picked off an old wall in Piccadilly. <b>L</b>, the only English
copy, was derived from the singing of a London vagrant. It is,
says Dixon, the common English broadsheet "turned into the
dialect of Cockaigne."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d053_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> <b>M</b> was probably a broadside or
stall copy, and is certainly of that quality, but preserves a
very ancient traditional feature.</p>

<p><b>D</b> and <b>M</b>, besides the name Linne, have in common
a repetition of the song, a trait which we also find in one
version of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_267.html">The Heir of Linne</a>;'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d053_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> see Dixon's Scottish
Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads, p. 30, stanzas 2-6,
Percy Society, vol. XVII.</p>

<p>In Bell's Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of
England, p. 68, it is remarked that <b>L</b>, "the only ancient
form in which the ballad has existed in print," is one of the
publications mentioned in one of Thackeray's catalogues of
broadsides. The 'Bateman,' in Thackeray's list, is the title of
an entirely different ballad, 'A Warning for Maidens, or Young
Bateman,' reprinted from the Roxburghe collection by W. Chappell,
III, 193.</p>

<p>"Young Beichan" is a favorite ballad, and most deservedly.
There are beautiful repetitions of the story in the ballads of
other nations, and it has secondary affinities with the extensive
cycle of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_17.html">Hind Horn</a>,' the parts of the principal actors in the
one being inverted in the other.</p>

<p>The hero's name is mostly Beichan, with slight modifications
like Bekie, <b>C</b>, Bicham, <b>A</b>, Brechin, <b>B</b>; in
<b>L</b>, Bateman; in <b>M</b>, Bondwell. The heroine is Susan
Pye in ten of the fourteen versions; Isbel in <b>C</b>; Essels,
evidently a variety of Isbel, in <b>M</b>, which has peculiar
relations with <b>C</b>; Sophia in <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>.</p>

<p>Beichan is London born in <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, [<b>E</b>],
<b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>N</b>, English born in <b>B</b>; London
city is his own, <b>A</b> 6, <b>B</b> 7, <b>F</b> 7, or he has a
hall there, <b>I</b> 7, <b>N</b> 27 f.; half Northumberland
belongs to him, <b>L</b>; he is lord of the towers of Line,
<b>D</b> 9, <b>C</b> 5, <b>M</b> 5, which are in London, <b>D</b>
15 f, but are transferred by reciters to the water of Tay,
<b>M</b> 29, and to Glasgow, or the vicinity, <b>H</b> 20.
<b>H</b>, though it starts with calling him London born, speaks
of him thereafter as a Scottish lord, 12, 18, 31.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d053_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Beichan has an Englishman's desire strange countries for to
see, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, [<b>E</b>], <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>,
<b>N</b>. In <b>C</b>, <b>M</b> he goes abroad, Quentin Durward
fashion, not to gratify his taste for travel, but to serve for
meat and fee. <b>F</b> makes him go to the Holy Land, without
specifying his motive, but we may fairly suppose it religious.
<b>C</b> sends him no further than France, and <b>M</b> to an
unnamed foreign land. He becomes the slave of a Moor or Turk,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>,
<b>N</b>, or a "Prudent," <b>F</b>, who treats him cruelly. They
bore his shoulders and put in a "tree," and make him draw carts,
like horse or ox, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, [<b>E</b>],
<b>H</b>; draw plough and harrow, <b>F</b>, plough and cart,
<b>N</b>; or tread the wine-press, <b>I</b>. This is because he
is a staunch Christian,
<a name="Page_I_456"/>
and would never bend a knee to Mahound or
Termagant, <b>E</b>, or onie of their stocks, <b>H</b>, or gods,
<b>I</b>. They cast him into a dungeon, where he can neither hear
nor see, and he is nigh perishing with hunger. This, also, is
done in <b>H</b> 5, on account of his perseverance in
Christianity; but in <b>C</b>, <b>M</b> he is imprisoned for
falling in love with the king's daughter, or other lovely may.</p>

<p>From his prison Beichan makes his moan (not to a stock or a
stone, but to the Queen of Heaven, <b>D</b> 4). His hounds go
masterless, his hawks flee from tree to tree, his younger brother
will heir his lands, and he shall never see home again, <b>E</b>,
<b>H</b>. If a lady [earl] would borrow him, he would run at her
stirrup [foot, bridle]; if a widow [auld wife] would borrow him,
he would become her son; and if a maid would borrow him, he would
wed her with a ring, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>B</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d053_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
The only daughter of the Moor, Turk, or king (of a 'Savoyen,'
<b>B</b> 5, perhaps a corruption of Saracen), already interested
in the captive, or immediately becoming so upon hearing Beichan's
song, asks him if he has lands and means at home to maintain a
lady that should set him free, and is told that he has ample
estates, all of which he would bestow on such a lady, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>. She
steals the keys and delivers the prisoner, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>;
refreshes him with bread and wine [wine], <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>J</b> 4, <b>K</b> 3, <b>B</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>L</b>; supplies him with money, <b>C</b> 9, <b>H</b> 15,
<b>M</b> 12, <b>N</b> 14, and with a ship, <b>F</b> 9, <b>H</b>
18, <b>L</b> 9; to which <b>C</b>, <b>M</b> add a horse and
hounds [and hawks, <b>M</b>]. She bids him mind on the lady's
love that freed him out of pine, <b>A</b> 8, <b>D</b> 12,
[<b>E</b> 13], <b>M</b> 14, <b>N</b> 15, and in <b>E</b> 16
breaks a ring from her finger, and gives half of it to Beichan to
assist his memory. There is a solemn vow, or at least a clear
understanding, that they are to marry within seven years,
<b>A</b> 9, <b>B</b> 9, <b>E</b> 12 f., <b>H</b> 17, 19, <b>L</b>
8, <b>N</b> 11 [three years, <b>C</b> 11].</p>

<p>When seven years are at an end, or even before, Susan Pye
feels a longing, or a misgiving, which impels her to go in search
of the object of her affections, and she sets her foot on good
shipboard, and turns her back on her own country, <b>A</b> 10,
<b>B</b> 10, <b>D</b> 15, <b>L</b> 10, <b>N</b> 23.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d053_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> <b>C</b>
and <b>M</b> preserve here a highly important feature which is
wanting in the other versions. Isbel, or Essels, is roused from
her sleep by the Billy Blin, <b>C</b> 14, by a woman in green, a
fairy, <b>M</b> 15, who makes known to her that that very day, or
the morn, is Bekie's [Bondwell's] wedding day. She is directed to
attire herself and her maids very splendidly, and go to the
strand; a vessel will come sailing to her, and they are to go on
board. The Billy Blin will row her over the sea, <b>C</b> 19; she
will stroke the ship with a wand, and take God to be her pilot,
<b>M</b> 19. Thus, by miraculons intervention, she arrives at the
nick of time.</p>

<p>Beichan's fickleness is not accounted for in most of the
versions. He soon forgot his deliverer and courted another, he
was young, and thought not upon Susan Pye, say <b>H</b>,
<b>N</b>, <b>C</b>, on the contrary, tells us that Beichan had
not been a twelvemonth in his own country, when he was forced to
marry a duke's daughter or lose all his land. <b>E</b> and
<b>K</b> intimate that he acts under constraint; the wedding has
lasted three and thirty days, and he will not bed with his bride
for love of one beyond the sea, <b>E</b> 21, <b>K</b> 1.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d053_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>On landing, Susan Pye falls in with a shepherd feeding his
flock, <b>E</b>, <b>K</b> [a boy watering his steeds, <b>M</b>].
She asks, 'Whose are these sheep, these kye, these castles? and
is told they are Lord Beichan's, <b>G</b>. She asks the news, and
is informed that there is a wedding in yonder hall that has
lasted thirty days and three, <b>E</b>, <b>K</b>, or that there
is to be a wedding on the morn, <b>M</b>; it seems to be a matter
generally known, <b>N</b>. In other versions she comes directly
to Young Beichan's hall, and is first informed by the porter,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, or the fact is
confirmed by the porter, <b>E</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>; she hears
the music within, and divines, <b>C</b>. She bribes the porter to
bid the bridegroom come
<a name="Page_I_457"/>
and speak to her, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,

wine, and not forget the lady who brought him out. of prison,
<b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>. In
<b>E</b> 26 she sends up her half ring to the bridegroom [a ring
in <b>N</b> 40, but not till Beichan has declined to come
down].</p>

<p>The porter falls on his knee and informs his master that the
fairest and richest lady that eyes ever saw is at the gate
[ladies, <b>C</b>, <b>M</b>] . The bride, or the bride's mother
more commonly, reproves the porter for bis graceless speech; he
might have excepted the bride, or her mother, or both: "Gin she
be braw without, we's be as braw within." But the porter is
compelled by truth to persist in his allegation; fair as they may
be, they were never to compare with yon lady, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>M</b>. Beichan takes the table with his

<p>This story of Beichan, or Bekie, agrees in the general outline,
and also in some details, with a well-known legend about Gilbert
Beket, father of St. Thomas. The earlier and more authentic
biographies lack this particular bit of romance, but the legend
nevertheless goes back to a date not much later than a century
after the death of the saint, being found in a poetical narrative
preserved in a manuscript of about 1300.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d053_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>We learn from this legend that Gilbert Beket, in his youth,
assumed the cross and went to the Holy Land, accompanied only by
one Richard, his servant. They "did their pilgrimage" in holy
places, and at last, with other Christians, were made captive by
the Saracens and put in strong prison. They suffered great
hardship and ignominy in the service of the Saracen prince
Admiraud. But Gilbert found more grace than the rest; he was
promoted to serve the prince at meat (in his chains), and the
prince often would ask him about England and the English faith.
Admiraud's only daughter fell in love with Gilbert, and when she
saw her time, in turn asked him the like questions. Gilbert told
her that he was born in London; told her of the belief of
Christians, and of the endless bliss that should be their meed.
The maid asked him if he was ready
<a name="Page_I_458"/>
to die for his Lord's love,
and Gilbert declared that he would, joyfully. When the maid saw
that he was so steadfast, she stood long in thought, and then
said, I will quit all for love of thee, and become Christian, if
thou wilt marry me. Gilbert feared that this might be a wile; he
replied that he was at her disposition, but he must bethink
himself. She went on loving him, the longer the more. After this
Gilbert and the rest broke prison and made their way to the
Christians. The prince's daughter, reduced to desperation by love
and grief, left her heritage and her kin, sparing for no sorrow,
peril, or contempt that might come to her, not knowing whither to
go or whether he would marry her when found, and went in quest of
Gilbert. She asked the way to England, and when she had come
there had no word but London to assist her further. She roamed
through the streets, followed by a noisy and jeering crowd of
wild boys and what not, until one day by chance she stopped by
the house in which Gilbert lived. The man Richard, hearing a
tumult, came out to see what was the matter, recognized the
princess, and ran to tell his master.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d053_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Gilbert bade Richard
take the lady to the house of a respectable woman near by, and
presently went to see her. She swooned when she saw him. Gilbert
was nothing if not discreet: he "held him still," as if he had
nothing in mind. But there was a conference of six bishops just
then at St. Paul's, and he went and told them his story and asked
advice. One of the six prophetically saw a divine indication that
the two were meant to be married, and all finally recommended
this if the lady would become Christian. Brought before the
bishops, she said, Most gladly, if he will espouse me; else I had
not left my kin. She was baptized<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d053_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> with great ceremony, and
the marriage followed.</p>

<p>The very day after the wedding Gilbert was seized with such an
overmastering desire to go back to the Holy Land that he wist not
what to do. But his wife was thoroughly converted, and after a
struggle with herself she consented, on condition that Beket
should leave with her the man Richard, who knew her language.
Gilbert was gone three years and a half, and when he came back

<p>That our ballad has been <i>affected</i> by the legend of
Gilbert Beket is altogether likely. The name Bekie is very close
to Beket, and several versions, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>T</b>, <b>N</b>, set out rather formally with the announcement
that Bekie was London born, like the Latin biographies and the
versified one of Garnier de Pont Sainte Maxence. Our ballad,
also, in some versions, has the Moor's daughter baptized, a point
which of course could not fail in the legend. More important
still is it that the hero of the English ballad goes home and
forgets the woman he has left in a foreign land, instead of going
away from home and forgetting the love he has left there. But the
ballad, for all that, is not derived from the legend. Stories and
ballads of the general cast of 'Young Beichan' are extremely
frequent.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d053_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The

legend lacks some of the main points of these
stories, and the ballad, in one version or another, has them, as
will be seen by referring to what has been said under '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_17.html">Hind Horn</a>,'
pp 194 ff. Bekie and Beket go to the East, like Henry and
Reinfrit of Brunswick, the Noble Moringer, the good Gerhard,
Messer Torello, the Sire de Cr&eacute;qui, Alexander of Metz, and
others. Like the larger part of these, they are made prisoners by
the Saracens. He will not bow the knee to Mahound; neither will
the Sire de Cr&eacute;qui, though he die for it.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d053_016','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Beichan is

"heathen" lady in the Danish ballad. In one version of Beichan,
<b>E</b>, the lady on parting with her love breaks her ring and
gives him one half, as Henry, or his wife, Reinfrit, Gerhard,
Cr&eacute;qui, and others do. At this point in the story the
woman pursues tbe man, and parts are inverted. Susan Pye is
warned that Beichan is to be married the next day, in <b>C</b> by
a Billy-Blin, in <b>M</b> by a woman in green, or fairy, and is
conveyed to Beichan's castle or hall with miraculous despatch,
just as Henry and others are warned, and are transported to their
homes by devil, angel, or necromancer. In <b>E</b> and <b>N</b>
the old love is identified by a half ring or ring, as in so many
of the stories of the class of Henry the Lion.</p>

essentially the same as that of 'Young Beichan.'</p>

<p>The variations of these twelve versions are insignificant. The
names Herr Peder den Rige and Ellensborg [Ellen] are found in
nearly all. It comes into Sir Peter's mind that he ought to go to
Jerusalem to expiate his sins, and he asks his betrothed,
Ellensborg, how long she will wait for him. She will wait eight
years, and marry no other, though the king should woo her [seven,
<b>L</b>; nine, <b>M</b>, "If I do not come then, break the
engagement;" eight, and not more, <b>N</b>]. The time passes and
Peter does not come back. Ellensborg goes to the strand. Traders
come steering in, and she is asked to buy of their ware, &mdash;
sendal, linen, and silk green as leek. She cares not for these
things; have they not seen her sister's son [brother], for whom
she is grieving to death? They know nothing of her sister's son,

that he sits in Austurr&iacute;ki drinking the ale of

says she. Ellensborg asks her brother to undertake a voyage for

than wait till summer she will go alone, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>,

asks the loan of a ship, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>,

better take another lover; the object is not worth the trouble;
the voyage is bad for a man and worse for a woman. Her maids give
her advice that is more to her mind, <b>E</b>, but are as prudent
as the rest in the latter <b>I</b>. She attires herself like a
knight, clips her maids' hair, <b>B</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>,

<p>The voyage is less than two months, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>; less than three months, <b>I</b>; quite three months,
<b>L</b>. It is the first day of the bridal when she lands,
<b>B</b> 22, <b>E</b> 24, <b>N</b> 14; in <b>B</b> Ellensborg
learns this from a boy who is walking on the sand. Sword at side,
she enters the hall where Peter is drinking his bridal. Peter,
can in hand, rises and says, Bless your eyes, my sister's son;
welcome to this strange land. In <b>B</b> he asks, How are my
father and mother? and she tells him that his father lies dead on
his bier, his mother in sick-bed. In <b>L</b>, waiting for no
greeting, she says, Well you sit at the board with your wife! Are
all lords wont thus to keep their faith? The bride's mother,
<b>D</b>, <b>G</b>, the heathen bride, <b>E</b>, an unnamed
person, probably the bride, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>N</b>, says, That is not your sister's son, but much more like
a woman; her hair is like spun gold, and braided up under a silk
cap.</p>

<p><b>A</b> tells us, and so <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, that it was two
months before Ellensborg could speak to Peter privately. Then, on
a Yule day, when he was going to church, sbe said, It does not
occur to you that you gave me your troth. Sir Peter stood as if
women had shorn his hair, and recollected all as if it had been
yesterday. In <b>B</b>-<b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>,
<b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, this incident has, perhaps, dropped out. In
these immediately, as in <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, after this
interview, Sir Peter, recalled to his senses or to his fidelity,
conceives the purpose of flying with Ellensborg. Good people, he
says, knights and swains, ladies and maids, follow my bride to
bed, while I take my sister's son over the meads, through the
wood, <b>B</b>-<b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>N</b>. In
<b>A</b>, <b>F</b>, Sir Peter asks the bride how long she will
bide while be takes bis nephew across the kingdom; in <b>G</b>
begs the boon that, since his sister's son is going, he may ride
with him, just accompany him to' the strand and take leave of him;
in <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, hopes she will not be angry if he convoys
his nephew three days on his way. (It is at this point in
<b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>, that the bride says it is
no sister's son, but a woman.) The bride remarks that there are
knights and swains enow to escort his sister's son, and that he
might more fitly stay where he is, but Sir Peter persists that he
will see his nephew off in person.</p>

<p>Sir Peter and Ellensborg go aboard the ship, he crying, You
will see me no more! When they are at sea Ellensborg lets out her
hair, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>; she wishes that the
abandoned bride may now feel the grief which she herself had
borne for years. The proceeding is less covert in <b>I</b>,
<b>L</b>, <b>M</b> than in the other versions.</p>

<p>As Ellensborg and Peter are making for the ship in <b>D</b>
30, 31 (and <b>G</b> 36, 37, borrowed from <b>D</b>), she says,
Tell me, Sir Peter, why would you deceive me so? Sir Peter
answers that he never meant to deceive her; it was the lady of
&Oslash;sterland that did it; she had changed his mind. A magical
change is meant. This
<a name="Page_I_461"/>
agrees with what is said in <b>A</b> 24, 25
(also <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>), that when Ellensborg got Peter alone
to herself, and said, You do not remember that you plighted your
troth to me, everything came back to him as if it had happened
yesterday. And again in the F&auml;r&ouml;e copy, <b>L</b> 49,
Ellensborg, from the prow, cries to Ingibj&ouml;rg on the strand,
Farewell to thee with thy <i>elfways</i>, vi&eth; t&iacute;tt
elvargangi! I have taken to myself my true love that I lent thee
so long; implying that Sir Peter had been detained by Circean
arts, by a sleepy drench of &oacute;minnis &ouml;l, or ale of
forgetfulness, Icelandic <b>M</b> 14, which, in the light of the
other ballads, is to be understood literally, and not
figuratively. The feature of a man being made, by magical or
other means, to forget a first love who had done and suffered
much for him, and being suddenly restored to consciousness and
his original predilection, is of the commonest occurrence in
traditional tales.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d053_021','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Our English ballad affords no other positive trace of external
interference with the hero's will than the far-fetched allegation
in <b>C</b> that the choice before him was to accept a duke's
daughter or forfeit his lands. The explanation of his inconstancy
in <b>H</b>, <b>N</b>, that young men ever were fickle found, is
vulgar, and also insufficient, for Beichan returns to his old
love <i>per saltum</i>, like one from whose eyes scales have
fallen and from whose back a weight has been taken, not tamely,
like a facile youth that has swerved. <b>E</b> and <b>K</b>, as
already said, distinctly recognize that Beichan was not acting
with free mind, and, for myself, I have little doubt that, if we
could go back far enough, we should find that he had all along
been faithful at heart.</p>

<p><b>Spanish</b>. <b>A</b>. 'El Conde Sol,' Duran, Romancero, I,
180, No 327, from tradition in Andalusia, by the editor; Wolf and
Hofmann, Primavera, II, 48, No 135. In this most beautiful
romance the County Sol, named general in great wars between Spain
and Portugal, and leaving a young wife dissolved in tears, tells
her that she is free to marry if he does not come back in six
years. Six pass, and eight, and more than ten, yet the county
does not return, nor does there come news of him. His wife
implores and obtains leave of her father to go in search of her
husband. She traverses France and Italy, land and sea, and is on
the point of giving up hope, when one day she sees a herdsman
pasturing cows. Whose are these cows? she asks. The County Sol's,
is the answer. And whose these wheatfields, these ewes, these
gardens, and that palace? whose the horses I hear neigh? The
County Sol's, is the answer in each case.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d053_022','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> And who that lady
that a man folds in his arms? The lady is betrothed to him and
the county is to marry her. The countess changes her silken robe
for the herdsman's sackcloth, and goes to ask an alms at the
county's gate. Beyond all hope, the county comes out himself to
bring it. "Whence comest thou, pilgrim?" he asks. She was born in
Spain. "How didst thou make thy way hither?" She came to seek her
husband, footing the thorns by land, risking the perils of the
sea; and when she found him he was about to marry, he had
forgotten his faithful wife. "Pilgrim, thou art surely the devil,
come to try me." "No devil," she said, "but thy wife indeed, and
therefore come to seek thee." Upon this, without a moment's
tarrying, the county ordered his horse, took up his wife, and
made his best speed to his native castle.

war is declared between France and Portugal, and the son of Conde
Burgos made general. The countess his wife does nothing but weep.
The husband tells her to marry again if be does not come back in
seven years. More than seven years are gone, and the lady's
father asks why she does not marry. "How can I," she replies, "if
the count is living? Give me your blessing, and let me go in
search of him." She goes a hundred leagues on foot, in the
disguise of a pilgrim. Arrived at a palace she sees pages pass,
and asks them for whom a horse is intended. It is for Count
Burgos's son, who marries that night. She asks to be directed to
the young count, is told that she will find him in the hall,
enters, and begs an alms, as coming from Italy and without a
penny. The young man says, If you come from Italy, what is the
news? Is Conde Bueso's wife living? The pilgrim desires some
description of the lady. It seems that she wore a very costly
petticoat on her wedding-day. The pilgrim takes off <i>her
glove</i> and shows her ring; she also takes off and shows the
expensive petticoat. There is great weeping in that palace, for
first wives never can be forgotten. Don Bueso and the pilgrim
clap hands and go home.</p>

<p><b>Italian</b>: Piedmontese. <b>A</b>. 'Moran d'Inghilterra,'
communicated to Rivista Contemporanea, XXXI, 3, 1862, by Nigra,
who gives the variations of four other versions. The daughter of
the sultan is so handsome that they know not whom to give her to,
but decide upon Moran of England. The first day of his marriage
he did nothing but kiss her, the second he wished to leave her,
and the third he went off to the war. "When shall you return?"
asked his wife. "If not in seven years, marry." She waited seven
years, but Moran did not come. His wife went all over England on
horseback, and came upon a cowherd. "Whose cows are these?" she
asked. They were Moran's. "Has Moran a wife?" This is the day
when he is to marry, and if she makes haste she will be in time
for the wedding. She spurs her horse, and arrives in season. They
offer her to drink in a gold cup. She will drink from no cup that
is not her own; she will not drink while another woman is there;
she will not drink till she is mistress. Moran throws his arms
round her neck, saying, Mistress you ever have been and still
shall be.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. 'Morando,' Ferraro, Canti popolari monferrini, p.
42, No 32, from Alessandria. Marando d'Inghilterra, of the king's
household, fell in love with the princess, for which the king
sent him off. The lady knocked at his door, and asked when he
would come back. In seven years, was the answer, and if not she
was to marry. The princess stole a bundred scudi from her father,
frizzled her hair French fashion, bought a fashionable suit, and
rode three days and nights without touching ground, eating, or
drinking. She came upon a laundryman, and asked who was in
command there. Murando. She knocked at the door, and Murando
asked, Have you come to our wedding? She would come to the dance.
At the dance she was recognized by the servants. Murando asked,
How came you here? "I rode three days and three nights without
touching ground, eating, or drinking." This is my wife, said
Murando; and the other lady he bade return to her father.</p>

<p>It is possible that this ballad may formerly have been known in
France. Nothing is left and known that shows this conclusively,
but there is an approach to the Norse form in a fragment which
occurs in several widely separated localities. A lover goes off
in November, promising his love to return in December, but does
not. A messenger comes to bid the lady, in his name, seek another
lover, for he has another love. "Is she fairer than I, or
<a name="Page_I_463"/>
more
powerful?" She is not fairer, but more powerful: she makes
rosemary flower on the edge of her sleeve, changes the sea into
wine and fish into flesh. Bujeaud, I, 203. In 'La Femme
Abandonn&eacute;e,' Puymaigre, I, 72, the lover is married to a

<p>A broadside ballad, 'The Turkish Lady,', The Turkish Lady and
the English Slave,' printed in Logan's Pedlar's Pack, p. 16,
Christie, I, 247, from singing, and preserved also in the Kinloch
Manuscripts, V, 53, I, 263, from Elizabeth Beattie's recitation,
simply relates how a Turkish pirate's daughter fell in love with
an Englishman, her slave, offered to release him if he would turn
Turk, but chose the better part of flying with him to Bristol,
and becoming herself a Christian brave.</p>

<p>Sir William Stanley, passing through Constantinople, is
condemned to die for his religion. A lady, walking under the
prison walls, hears his lament, and begs his life of the Turk.
She would make him her husband, and bring him to adore Mahomet.
She offers to set the prisoner free if he will marry her, but he
has a wife and children on English ground. The lady is sorry, but
generously gives Stanley five hundred pounds to carry him to his
own country. Sir William Stanley's Garland, Halliwell's Palatine
Anthology, pp 277 f.</p>

<p>Two Magyars have been shut up in a dungeon by tbe sultan, and
have not seen sun, moon, or stars for seven years. The sultan's
daughter hears their moan, and offers to free them if they will
take her to Hungary. This they promise to do. She gets the keys,
takes money, opens the doors, and the three make off. They are
followed; one of the Magyars kills all the pursuers but one, who
is left to carry back the news. It is now proposed that there
shall be a duel to determine who shall have the lady. She begs
them rather to cut off her head than to fight about her.
