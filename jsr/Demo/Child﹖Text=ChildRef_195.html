<h3>Lord Maxwell's Last Goodnight</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Lord Maxwell's Last Goodnight,' communicated 
to Percy by G. Paton, 1778. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d19501.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
<li>'Lord Maxwell's Goodnight,' Glenriddell Manuscripts, XI, 
18, 1791, Scott's Minstrelsy, 1, 194, 1802; II, 133, 
1833. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d19502.html"><i>Version B</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>First published in the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border,
"from a copy in Glenriddell's Manuscript, with some slight
variations from tradition." I understand this to mean, not that
the variations were derived from tradition, but that the text of
the Minstrelsy departs somewhat from that of the manuscript.</p>

<p><b>A</b> and <b>B</b> agree entirely as to matter. The order
of the stanzas, not being governed by an explicit story, might be
expected to vary with every reciter.</p>

<p>In the year 1585, John, Lord Maxwell, having incurred the
enmity of the king's favorite, the Earl of Arran, was denounced
rebel, on such charges as were always at hand, and a commission
was given to the Laird of Johnstone to pursue and take him. A
hired force, by the aid of which this was expected to be done,
was badly routed by the Maxwells in a sharp fight. Johnstone made
a raid on Maxwell's lands; Maxwell burnt Johnstone's house.
Finally, in one of their skirmishes, Johnstone was captured: "the
grief of this overthrow gave Johnstone, shortly after he was
liberated, his death."</p>

<p>After some years of feud, the two chiefs, "by the industry of
certain wise gentlemen of the Johnstones," surprised all Scotland
by mak ing a treaty of peace. On April 1, 1592, they entered into
a bond to forget and forgive all rancor and malice of the past,
and to live in amity, themselves and their friends, in all time
coming. A little more than a year after, a party of Johnstones,
relying, no doubt, on the forbearance of their new ally, then
warden of the West Marches, ** rode a stealing "in the lands of
Lord Sanquhar and of the knights of Drumlanrig, Lag, and
Closeburn, carried off a large booty, and killed eighteen men who
en deavored to retrieve their property. (See No 184, '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_184.html">The Lads of Wamphray</a>.')
The injured gentlemen made complaint to Maxwell as
warden, and also procured a commission directing him to proceed
against the Johnstones. Maxwell was in an awkward plight. To
induce him to take action, several of the sufferers engaged to
enter into a bond of manrent, or homage, to Maxwell, by which
they should be obliged to service and he to protection. "Maxwell,
thinking this to be a good occasion for bringing all Nithsdale to
depend upon him, embraced the offer." But this bond, through
negligence, came to the hands of Johnstone, who, seeing what turn
matters would take, made a league with Scotts, Eliots, and
others, and in a battle at Dryfe Sands, by superior strategy,
defeated Maxwell, though the warden had much larger numbers. This
was in December, 1593. "The Lord Maxwell, a tall man and heavy in
armor, was in the chase overtaken and stricken from his horse.
The report went that he called to Johnstone and desired to be
taken as he had sometime taken his father, but was unmercifully
used, and the hand that he reached forth cut off. But of this,"
says Spotiswood, "I can affirm nothing. There always the Lord
Maxwell fell, having received many wounds." Drumlanrig,
Closeburn, and other of the Nithsdale lairds of Maxwell's
faction, barely escaped with their lives.</p>

<p>Sir James Johnstone soon made his peace with the king, whose
warden had been slain while acting under royal authority. The
heir of the slain warden, John, the ninth Lord Maxwell, is said
to have been only eight years old at the time of his father's
death.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d195_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> If this was so, he became very early of age for all
purposes of offence. The two clans kept up a bloody and
destructive private war. Both chiefs were imprisoned and
proclaimed rebel or traitor; Maxwell twice, first in 1601, as fa
voring popery, and again in 1607, for his extravagant turbulence;
and in each case he made his own escape, the second time by the
use of violence. At length, influenced perhaps by a conviction
that his defiance of the law had gone too far for his safety,
Maxwell seemed to be seriously disposed to reconcile himself with
his inveterate enemy.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d195_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Sir James Johnstone, as it happened,
had already asked Sir Robert Maxwell, who was his brother-in-law
and cousin to Lord Maxwell, to speak to his kinsman with that
view. Sir Robert had no wish to meddle, for his cousin, he said,
was a dangerous man to have to do with. Lord John, however,
spontaneously sent for Sir Robert, and said to him, You see my
estate and the danger I stand in. I would crave your counsel as a
man that tenders my weal. The result of much conference and
writing (in which Sir Robert Maxwell, evidently feel ing
imperfect confidence in his cousin, acted with great caution) was
that Lord Maxwell proposed a tryst with Sir James Johnstone, each
of them to be accompanied by one person only, and no others to be
present except Sir Robert, and faithfully promised, with his
hands between Sir Robert's hands, that neither he nor the man he
should bring with him should do any wrong, "whether they agreed
or not." Johnstone accepted the terms and made corresponding
promises. The meeting came off the 6th of April, 1608. Johnstone
brought Willie Johnstone with him, and Maxwell Charlie Maxwell, a
man that Sir Robert strongly disapproved, but his chief undertook
to be answerable for him. Sir Robert required the same guaranty
on the part of Johnstone for his follower, and these men were
ordered to keep away from one another. The two principals and
their mediator between them rode off, with their backs to their
men, and began their parley. Looking round, Sir Robert saw that
Charlie Maxwell had left his appointed place and gone to Willie
Johnstone, at whom, after some words between them, he fired a
pistol. Sir Robert cried to Lord Maxwell, Fie, make not yourself
a traitor and me both ! Lord Maxwell replied, I am blameless. Sir
James Johnstone slipped away to see to his follower's safety.
Lord Maxwell followed Sir James, shot him in the back, and rode
off.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d195_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Lord Maxwell fled the country, but was tried in his absence
and sentenced to death, with forfeiture of his estates. He came
back to Scotland after four years, was basely be trayed into the
power of the government by a kinsman, and was beheaded at
Edinburgh May 21, 1613.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d195_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"Thus was finally ended," remarks Sir Walter Scott, "by a
salutary example of severity, the 'foul debate' betwixt the Max
wells and Johnstones, in the course of which each family lost two
chieftains: one dying of a broken heart, one in the field of
battle, one by assassination, and one by the sword of the
executioner."</p>

<p><b>A</b> 1, 2, and <i>passim</i> The very affectionate
relations of Lord Maxwell and his 'lady and only joy,' are a
fiction of the ballad-maker. His wife was daughter of the first
Marquis of Hamilton. Maxwell instituted a process of divorce
against her, and she died while this was pending, before he fled
the country in 1608. By his treatment of his wife he made her
brother, the second marquis, and the Hamiltons generally, his
enemies.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d195_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>5, 6. Carlaverock castle had from far back belonged to the
Maxwells, and is theirs still. They had a house, or castle, at
Dumfries, and the custody of the "houses" of Lochmaben, Langholm,
and Thrieve.</p>

<p>9, 10. Douglas of Drumlanrig, Kirkpatrick of Closeburn, and
Grierson of Lag fled in the <i>sauve qui peut</i> of Dryfe Sands,
and the partisans of Lord Maxwell, who there lost his life, would
naturally describe them as deserting their chief. They (or two of
them) had entered into a "band" with Maxwell, as aforesaid. The
ballad-maker seems to intimate that they were in a band with each
other, or with somebody, to betray Maxwell.</p>

<p>11, and <b>B</b> 1. 'Robin in the Orchet,' 'Robert of
Oarchyardtoan,' is properly Sir Robert Maxwell of Orchardton,
Lord John's cousin, but it is evident, from the conjunction of
mother and sisters, that the person here intended is his brother
Robert, to whom, some years after the execution and forfeiture of
Lord John, the estates were restored.</p>

<p>14. Maxwell's wife, as said above, was no longer living. The
"offers" which he made, to save his life, contain a proposal that
he should marry the slain Sir James Johnstone's daughter, without
any dowry.</p>

<p>"Goodnight" is to be taken loosely as a farewell. Other cases
are 'John Armstrong's last Goodnight,' and the well-known
beautiful fragment (?) of two stanzas called 'Armstrong's
Goodnight;' again, Essex's last Good night, to the tune of The
King's last Good night, Chappell, Roxburghe Ballads, I, 570, and
Popular Music, p. 174. The Earl of Derby sings a Goodnight
(though the name is not used) in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_168.html">Flodden Field</a>,' No 168, III,
356, stanzas 36-58. Justice Shallow sang those tunes that he
heard the carmen whistle, and s ware they were his Fancies, or
his Goodnights: Second Part of Henry IV, III, 2. Lord Byron, in
the preface to Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, says "the good-night
in the beginning of the first canto was suggested by Lord
Maxwell's Goodnight in the Border Minstrelsy."</p>
