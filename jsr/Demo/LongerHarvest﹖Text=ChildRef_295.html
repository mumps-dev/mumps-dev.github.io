<h3>The Brown Girl</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'The bonny Brown Girl,' 'The Brown Girl,' The 
Brown Girl's Garland, British Museum, 11621. c. 3 
(10). <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d29501.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
<li>As lately taken down in Devon by Rev. S. Baring Gould. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d29502.html"><i>Version B</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>A young man who has been attached to a girl sends her word by
letter that he cannot fancy her because she is so brown (he has
left her for another maid in <b>B</b>). She sends a disdainful
reply. He writes again that he is dangerously ill (he is
love-sick in <b>B</b>), and begs her come to him quickly and give
him back his faith. She takes her time in going, and when she
comes to the sick man's bedside, cannot stand for laughing. She
has, however, brought a white wand with her, which she strokes on
his breast, in sign that she gives him back the faith which he
had given her. But as to forgetting and forgiving, that she will
never do; she will dance upon his grave.</p>

<p>This little ballad recalls '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_73.html">Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</a>' ('Lord
Thomas and Fair Ellinor, with the downfall of the Brown Girl' ),
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_77.html">Sweet William's Ghost</a>,' 'Clerk Saunders,' '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_78.html">The Unquiet Grave</a>,'
'Bonny Barbara Allan,' and has something of all of them. Compare
No 73; No 77, <b>A</b> 4, <b>B</b> 2, 9, <b>C</b> 6, 14, <b>D</b>
4, 13, <b>E</b> 6, 14; No 84 (for the laughing, <b>B</b> 12); No
69, <b>A</b> 20-22, <b>D</b> 11, 14, <b>E</b> 17-20, <b>G</b>
23-25; No (78, <b>B</b> 2, <b>E</b> 2, <b>F</b> 2. Still it is
not deliberately and mechanically patched together (as are some
pieces in Part VIII), and in the point of the proud and
unrelenting character of the Brown Girl it is original.</p>
