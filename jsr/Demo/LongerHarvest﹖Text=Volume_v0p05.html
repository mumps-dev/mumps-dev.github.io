<h3>Preface</h3>

<p>The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, edited by the late
Francis James Child, was published in ten parts, forming five
large volumes, from 1882 to 1898. It contains three hundred and
five distinct ballads, but the number of texts printed in full is
much larger than this, for Professor Child's plan was to give
every extant version of every ballad. Thus of No. 4, 'Lady
Isabel and the Elf-Knight,' he published nine different versions;
of No. 58, 'Sir Patrick Spens,' eighteen; of No. 173, 'Mary
Hamilton,' twenty-eight, &mdash; and so on. Each ballad has an
introduction dealing with the history and bibliography of the
piece, and containing a full account of parallels in foreign
languages, and, in general, of the diffusion of the story, with
other pertinent matter. There are also exhaustive collations,
elaborate bibliographies, an index of published ballad airs, a
collection of tunes, &mdash; and, in a word, all the apparatus
necessary for the study of this kind of literature.</p>

<p>The present volume offers a selection from the materials
collected and edited by Mr. Child, and is prepared in accordance
with a plan which he had approved. Each of the three hundred and
five ballads in his large collection (except Nos. 33, 279, 281,
290, and 299) is represented by one or more versions, without the
apparatus criticus, and with very short introductions. The notes,
which are necessarily brief, give specimens (and specimens only)
of significant stanzas from versions not included in the volume.
The numbers (1-305) and letters (<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, etc.)
correspond to the designations used in the large collection, and
there is, in every case, an implied reference to that work for
further information. For instance, 'The Twa Sisters' (No. 10) is
here represented by two versions, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, selected
from those published by Mr. Child, which (as the note on p. 642
indicates) are twenty-seven in number. To <b>A</b> is prefixed
(both in this volume and in the large collection) a memorandum of
the four sources (<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>) from
which Mr. Child derived this version. The text, as printed on pp.
18, 19, is identical with the text of a as edited by Mr. Child,
but the variant readings, fully registered in the large
collection, are omitted. The short introduction to No. 10 is
extracted from Mr. Child's eight-page introduction, to which the
student who wishes to pursue the subject will naturally have
recourse. Mr. Child's own words are retained whenever that was
possible. The present volume, it will be observed, is neither a
new edition of the collection of Mr. Child nor a substitute for
it. It differs from that work in scope and purpose. Yet it is, in
a manner, complete in itself. It affords a conspectus of English
and Scottish ballad literature which, it is hoped, may be useful
to the general reader and may lead those who feel a more
particular interest in the subject to acquaint themselves at
first hand with the full collection of texts and other apparatus
in Mr. Child's admirable volumes.</p>

<p>The Glossary is based on that in the larger work. It is not
intended to furnish material for linguistic investigations, but
merely to assist the reader.</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, it has seemed best to reproduce the List
of Sources entire. For other bibliographical lists the large
collection may be consulted.</p>

<p>The general Introduction has been written especially for this
book. It attempts to sum up, as simply and judicially as may be,
the present state of a very complicated discussion.</p>

<p>The portrait of Mr. Child is from a photograph belonging to
Miss Catharine Innes Ireland.</p>

<p>Professor Neilson has had the great kindness to relieve the
editors of the difficult task of preparing the glossary, and Miss
Ireland has rendered invaluable assistance in proof-reading.
Without the help of these generous and self-sacrificing friends
the appearance of the book would have been long delayed.</p>
