</ol>

<p><b>A</b> was No. 6 of the fifteen ballads written down by Mrs.
Brown for William Tytler in 1783: Anderson, in Nichols's
Illustrations, VII, 176. This copy was printed by Scott in his
Minstrelsy, II, 60, 1802, "chiefly from Mrs. Brown's Manuscript,"
but with numerous alterations. Kinloch's annotated copy of his
Ancient Scottish Ballads supplies an additional stanza of
<b>C</b>; the 17th.</p>

<p>The story in <b>A</b> is that Rose the Red and White Lily have
a bad step-mother, who, however, has two good sons that love
these maids: Brown Robin, Lily, and Arthur, Rose. The maids build
a bower, in which the young people make very merry, and the
step-mother, to spoil sport, tells her sons that they must sail
the sea. Brown Robin goes to the wood, and Arthur to the king's
court. The maids disguise themselves as men, and take service
with their lovers: White Lily under the name of Roge the Round,
and Rose the Red under that of Sweet Willy. Before they part they
make a mutual vow that at three blasts of a horn the one shall
come to the other's help. Once upon a time, when Robin and his
men are putting the stone, Roge sets it seven foot beyond all the
rest, but, having exerted herself too much in so doing, is fain
to lean her back against an oak and utters a moan, by which Brown
Robin perceives that Roge is a woman. Forty weeks after this Roge
has occasion for the aid of a bower-wife. Brown Robin proffers
his help, but it is declined; nevertheless, with an apparent but
not a real inconsistency, the lady asks him to blow her horn, for
she has a brother at the court who will come to her upon the
sound. Robin replies that if she has a brother whom she loves
better than him she may blow the horn herself. This she does, and
Sweet Willy comes at once. Brown Robin will let no man enter the
bower without a fight. Rose the Red is wounded, and avows herself
to be a woman. Brown Robin is distressed: he wished never to see
a woman's blood, for the sake of a maid named White Lily. Roge
the Round reveals herself as that same. Word comes to the king's
court that Brown Robin's man has borne a son, and the king
declares that he will go to the wood to inquire into this marvel.
Arthur will go with him, to find a foot-page who had left him.
Arrived at the wood, Arthur blows his horn, and Sweet Willy comes
running to him. Arthur asks the page why he had run away, and is
told that it was to see a brother that lives in the wood. The
king enters the bower, and finds White Lily nursing her son. This
leads to an explanation on the part of Rose the Red. Brown Robin,
coming in from hunting, starts to see the king. The king bids him
have no fear, but quit the wood and come to court. Brown Robin
and White Lily, Arthur and Rose the Red, go to church and are
married.</p>

<p>In <b>B</b> the two maids, ill-treated by their step-mother,
betake themselves to the wood, where they meet, not Brown Robin,
but Robin Hood, and take service with him. Rose and Lily change
parts; Rose, under the name of Nicholas, consorting with Robin
Hood, and Lily, alias Roger Brown, with Little John. It is not,
however, Robin Hood and Little John who turn out to be their
lovers, but "a lad in the company," and "another youth among the
company," stanzas 30, 51. Nothing is said of the king.</p>

<p>In the fragmentary <b>C</b> the maids are daughters of a king.
Their proper names are not given, and we do not learn that the
step-mother has a pair of sons. In consequence of the harshness
of their step-mother, these king's daughters go to the wood as
Nicholas and Rogee Roun, to seek Robin Hood, and they are
discovered to be maids by a song which Rogee sings. Rogee is
wedded to Robin Hood, and Nicholas to Little John.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that the Robin Hood of <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
was suggested by the Brown Robin of <b>A</b>. The name Barnsdale
in <b>A</b> 12, 51 has certainly been adopted from the Robin Hood
cycle, but in the present ballad is the residence of the father
of Rose and Lily, not that of Robin Hood.</p>

<p>The only part of the ballad which has the stamp of indubitably
ancient tradition is the child-birth in the wood, and this scene
is the rightful, and perhaps exclusive, property of 'Leesome
Brand,' No 15: see I, 182. <b>A</b> 24-29, <b>B</b> 40-47, are
found again in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_101.html">Willie o Douglas Dale</a>,' <b>A</b> 15-17, 22, 23,
<b>B</b> 18, 19, 22, 24, <b>C</b> 8-10, and the first part of
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_101.html">Willie o Douglas Dale</a>,' as well as of the ballad which
immediately precedes the present, commonly called 'The Birth of
Robin Hood,' is a variation of 'Leesome Brand.'</p>

<p>Robin Hood has no love-story in any ancient ballad, though his
name has been foisted into modern love-ballads, as in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_126.html">Robin Hood and the Tanner</a>'s
Daughter,' No 8 C. Maid Marian is a late
accretion. There is a piteously vulgar broadside, in which Maid
Marian, being parted from Robin Hood, dresses herself "like a
page" (but armed fully), meets Robin Hood, also under disguise,
and has an hour's fight with him. There is so far a resemblance
in this to <b>A</b> 30 ff, <b>B</b> 49, that a woman disguised as
a page fights with Robin Hood. I suppose the resemblance to be
accidental, but whether it be or not, the question of 'Rose the
Red and White Lily' being originally a Robin Hood ballad is not
affected.</p>

<p><b>A</b> 3, <b>B</b> 5, is like <b>C</b> 6 of 'The Clerk's Twa 
Sons o Owsenford,' No 72.</p>

<p>Scott's copy is translated by Doenniges, p. 40.</p>
