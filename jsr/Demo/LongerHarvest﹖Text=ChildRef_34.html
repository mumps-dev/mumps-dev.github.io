<p>It is not, perhaps, material to explain how Owain, "the king's
son Urien," happens to be awarded the adventure which here
follows. It is enough that his right is as good as that of other
knights to whom the same achievement has been assigned, though
the romance, or, as the phrase used to be, "the book," says
nothing upon the subject. Owain's slaying the fire-drake who was
getting the better of the lion may have led to his name becoming
associated with the still more gallant exploit of thrice kissing
a fire-drake to effect a disenchantment. The ring in <b>A</b> 9
might more plausibly be regarded as being a repetition of that
which Owain's lady gave him on leaving her for a twelvemonth's
outing, a ring which would keep him from loss of blood, and also
from prison, sickness, and defeat in battle &mdash; in short,
preserve him against all the accidents which the knight suggested
might prevent his holding his day &mdash; provided that he had it
by him and thought on her. Ritson, Ywaine and Gawin, vv
1514-38.</p>

<p>But an Icelandic saga comes near enough to the story of the
ballad as given in <b>A</b> to show where its connections lie.
&Aacute;ls&oacute;l and a brother and sister are all transformed
by a stepmother, a handsome woman, much younger than her husband.
&Aacute;ls&oacute;l's heavy weird is to he a nondescript monster
with a horse's tail, hoofs, and mane, white eyes, big mouth, and
huge hands, and never to be released from the spell till a king's
son shall consent to kiss her. One night when
Hj&aacute;lmt&egrave;r had landed on a woody island, and it had
fallen to him to keep watch, he heard a great din and crashing in
the woods, so that the oaks trembled. Presently this monster came
out of the thicket
<a name="Page_I_307"/>
with a fine sword in her hand, such as he had
not seen the like of. They had a colloquy, and he asked her to
let him have the sword. She said he should not have it unless he
would kiss her. "I will not kiss thy snout," said
Hj&aacute;lmt&egrave;r, "for mayhap I should stick to it." But
something came into his mind which made him think better of her
offer, and he said he was ready. "You must leap upon my neck,
then," she said, "when I throw up the sword, and if you then
hesitate, it will be your death." She threw up the sword, he
leaped on her neck and kissed her, and she gave him the sword,
with an augury of victory and good luck for him all his days. The
retransformation does not occur on the spot, but further on
Hj&aacute;lmt&egrave;r meets &Aacute;ls&oacute;l as a young lady
at the court of her brother, who has also been restored to his
proper form and station; everything is explained;
Hj&aacute;lmt&egrave;r marries her, and his foster-brother her
sister. Hj&aacute;lmt&egrave;rs ok &Ouml;lvers Saga, cc 10, 22,
Rafn, Fornaldar S&ouml;gur, III, 473 ff, 514 ff.</p>

<p>In many tales of the sort a single kiss suffices to undo the
spell and reverse the transformation; in others, as in the ballad,
three are required. The triplication of the kiss has led in
<b>A</b> to a triplication of the talisman against wounds. The
popular genius was inventive enough to vary the properties of the
several gifts, and we may believe that belt, ring, and sword had
originally each its peculiar quality. The peril of touching fin
or tail in <b>A</b> seems to correspond to that in the saga of
hesitating when the sword is thrown up.</p>

<p>The <b>Danish</b> ballad, 'Jomfruen i Ormeham,' from
manuscripts of the sixteenth and the seventeenth century,
Grundtvig, No 59, II, 177, resembles both the first version of
the Scottish ballad and the Icelandic saga in the points that the
maid offers gifts and is rehabilitated by a kiss. The maid in her
proper shape, which, it appears, she may resume for a portion of
the day, stands at Sir Jenus's bedside and offers him gifts
&mdash; five silver-bowls, all the gold in her kist, twelve
foals, twelve boats &mdash; and ends with saying, "Were I a
swain, as you are, I would betroth a maid." It is now close upon
midnight, and she hints that he must be quick. But Jenus is fast
asleep the while; twelve strikes, and the maid instantly turns
into a little snake. The page, however, has been awake, and he
repeats to his master all that has occurred.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d034_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Sir Jenus
orders his horse, rides along a hillside, and sees the little
snake in the grass. He bends over and kisses it, and it turns to
a courteous maid, who thanks him, and offers him any boon he may
ask. He asks her to be his, and as she has loved him before this,
she has no difficulty in plighting him her troth.</p>

<p>A maid transformed by a stepmother into a tree is freed by
being kissed by a man, in 'Jomfruen i Linden,' Grundtvig, II,
214, No 66, Kristensen, II, 90, No 31; 'Linden,' Afzelius, III,
114, 118, No 87. In 'Linden,' Kristensen, I, 13, No 5, a
combination of two ballads, a prince cuts down the linden, which
changes to a linden-worm; he kisses the worm, and a young maid
stands before him.</p>

<p>A knight bewitched into the shape of a troll is restored by
being kissed by a peasant's wife thrice [once], 'Trolden og
Bondens Hustru,' Grundtvig, II, 142, No 52, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; a
prince by a kiss from a maid, 'Lindormen,' Grundtvig, D. g. F.,
II, 211, No 6.3 <b>A</b>, 'Slangen og den lille Pige,' Danske
Folkeminder, 1861, p. 15.</p>

<p>The removal of a spell which compels man or woman to appear
continuously or alternately as a monster, commonly a snake, by
three kisses or by one, is a regular feature in the numerous
German tales of Schlangenjungfrauen, Weissefrauen. Often the man
is afraid to venture the third kiss, or even a single one. See

<p>Rivals or peers of Owain among romantic knights are, first,
Lanzelet, in Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's poem, who kisses a serpent
on the mouth once, which, <i>after bathing in a spring</i> (see
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_39.html">Tam Lin</a>'), becomes the finest woman ever seen: vv 7836-7939.
Brandimarte, again, in Orlando Innamorato, lib. II., c. XXVI,
stanzas 7-15; and Carduino, I Cantari di Carduino, Rajna, stanzas
49, 54 f, 61-64, pp 35-41. Le Bel Inconnu is an involuntary
instrument in such a disenchantment, for the snake fascinates him
first and kisses him without his knowledge; he afterwards goes to
sleep, and finds a beautiful woman standing at his head when he
wakes: ed. Hippeau, p. 110 ff, v. 3101 ff. The English Libius
Disconius is kist or he it wist, and the dragon at once turns to
a beautiful woman: Percy Manuscript, Hales &amp; Furnivall, II,
493f; Ritson, Romances, II, 84 f. Espertius, in Tiran le Blanc,
is so overcome with fear that he cannot kiss the dragon, &mdash;
a daughter of Hippocrates, transformed by Diana, in the island of
Lango, &mdash; but Espertius not running away, as two men before
him had done, the dragon kisses him with equally good effect:
Caylus, Tiran le Blanc, II, 334-39. This particular
disenchantment had not been accomplished down to Sir John
Mandeville's time, for he mentions only the failures: Voyage and
Travel, c. iv, pp 28-31, ed. 1725. Amadis d'Astra touches two
dragons on the face and breast, and restores them to
young-ladyhood: Historia del Principe Sferamundi, the 13th book
of Amadis of Gaul, P. II, c. xcvii, pp 458-462, Venice, 1610.
This feat is shown by the details to be only a variation of the
story in Tiran le Blanc.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d034_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Lamb, of Norham, communicated to Hutchinson,
author of 'A View of Northumberland,' a ballad entitled' The
Laidley Worm of Spindleston Heughs,' with this harmless preamble:
"A song 500 years old, made by the old Mountain Bard, Duncan
Frasier, living on Cheviot, A.D. 1270. From an ancient
manuscript." This composition of Mr. Lamb's &mdash; for nearly
every line of it is his &mdash; is not only based on popular
tradition, but evidently preserves some small fragments of a
popular ballad, and for this reason is given in an Appendix.
There is a copy deviating but very little from the print in
Kinloch's Manusctipts, I, 187. It was obtained from the
recitation of an old woman in Berwickshire.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d034_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In this recited
version the Child of Wynd, or Childy Wynd (Child O-wyne), has
become Child o Wane (Child O-wayn).</p>

<p>Mr. R.H. Evans, in his preface to this ballad, Old Ballads,
1810, IV, 241, says that Mr. Turner had informed him "that a lady
upwards of seventy had heard her mother repeat an older and
nearly similar ballad."</p>
