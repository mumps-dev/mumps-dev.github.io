<h3>Prince Heathen</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'The Disconsolate Lady,' The Jovial Rake's Garland,
n. d., p. 6, No 4. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d10401.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
<li>'Prince Heathen,' Buchan's Manuscripts, I, 97;
Motherwell's Manuscript, p. 665. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d10402.html"><i>Version B</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>The fragment <b>A</b> (pointed out to me by Svend Grundtvig)
is partly explained by <b>B</b>, which is no doubt some
stall-copy, reshaped from tradition. Motherwell's copy was
derived from Buchan.</p>

<p>The story, which reads like an old one extremely corrupted, is
none too intelligible even in the longer form. Lady Margery is
sitting in her bower-door. Prince Heathen comes by and gives her
a ring. She refuses him her love. He swears that he will make her
greet; she swears that he shall not. He takes her maidenhead:
still she will not greet. He tells her that he has killed her
father, mother, and seven brothers: still she will not greet. He
puts her in a vault of stone, fastened with five and thirty
locks: she will not greet [go, <b>A</b>], but rues. He comes back
from the mountains, and asks her how she is faring. Dying, she
says. He takes her out upon the green, allowing her no female
service, and she brings forth a son. How is it with her now?
Dying. She asks for a drink of water: he will not give her a drop
until she wraps up her young son. She has nothing to wrap the
babe in; he gives her his horse-sheet; her tears fall fast.
"Bonny may, now you greet!" he exclaims ["will you go now?"
<b>A</b>]. But she greets not for him; it is for her young son,
wrapped so roughly. Prince Heathen, satisfied, as far as we can
see, now that he has subdued her proud will, orders his son to be
rolled in silk and washed in milk, according to the usage of
Scottish nursery: see No 5, <b>B</b> 61, <b>C</b> 82, 83,
<b>E</b> 32, <b>F</b> 57, <b>G</b> 33; No 20, <b>C</b> 8; No 63,
<b>B</b> 35, <b>C</b> 35, <b>F</b> 22, <b>J</b> 47; No 101,
<b>A</b> 25. Having broken her spirit, he loves her well.</p>
