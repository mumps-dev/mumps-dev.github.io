<h3>The Twa Knights</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 271. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d26801.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>A knight and a squire, sworn brothers, have a talk about fair
women. 'There's nae gude women but nine,' says the squire. 'My
luck is the better,' replies the knight, 'that one of them is
mine.' The squire undertakes to win the knight's wife within six
months, if the husband will go over seas for that time; the
knight is willing to give him nine months. The knight's lands are
wagered (21) against the squire's life (23). As soon as the
knight is at sea, the squire comes to the lady with an offer of
money. If you were not my lord's brother, says the lady, I would
hang you on a pin before my door. The squire betakes himself to
his foster-mother, sets forth his case, and offers her a heavy
bribe for her aid. The false carline goes to the lady and opens
her business; the lady will never wrong her lord. The carline
(who is the wife's foster-mother as well) now pretends concern
about the lady's health, which is in danger for want of sleep.
She turns all the people out of the castle, lulls the dame to
sleep, and introduces the squire. He wakes the lady, and tells
her that she is in his power. The lady has presence of mind; it
would, she says, be a sin to defile her husband's bed, but she
will come to the squire's bed at night. She then offers her niece
five hundred pounds to go to the squire in her place. The young
woman was never so much disposed to say nay, but goes,
notwithstanding. When the squire has had his will, he cuts off
'her ring but and her ring-finger.' The maids come from the hay,
the young men from the corn, and the lady tells them all that has
passed. She will tie her finger in the dark, and hopes to loose
it in the light. The knight returns, and is greeted by the squire
as a landless lord. The ring and ring-finger are exhibited in
proof. Thereupon the knight gives a dinner, to which he asks the
squire and his wife's parents. He throws his charters across the
table and bids his wife farewell forever. It is now time for the
lady to loose in the light the finger which she had tied in the
dark. Come here, my lord, she says. No smith can join a finger.
My niece 'beguiled the squire for me.' They lay before the niece
a sword and a ring, and she is to have her choice, to stick the
squire with the sword, or to wed him with the ring. Thrice she
puts out her hand as if to take the sword, but she ends with
taking up the ring.</p>

<p>This ballad can have had no currency in Scotland, and perhaps
was known only through print. A similar one is strictly
traditional in Greece, and widely dispersed, both on the mainland
and among the islands.</p>

&#967;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#960;&#955;&#8134;&#962;,
the chancellor) and wife.</p>

<p>At the king's table there is talk of women fair or foul.
Maurianos extols his sister (the chancellor his wife, <b>I</b>),
whom gifts cannot seduce. What shall be your forfeit, asks the
king, if I seduce her? Maurianos stakes his head,
<b>A</b>-<b>I</b>, and the girl is to be the king's slave,
<b>H</b>; the king, his kingdom and crown, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
his property, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>. There is a mutual wager of nine
towers of silver, <b>J</b>. The young man is to be a prisoner
till the morning, <b>I</b>. The king begins, in <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, by engaging the services of witches eighteen, witches
fifteen, or bawds eighteen, witches fifteen. They ply their magic
early and late: forty days to get up her stair, other
four-and-forty to get sight of the girl, <b>A</b>. They address
her with flatteries, but are rebuffed, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. The
king sends rich presents, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>-<b>I</b>; beasts
laden with silver and money, nine, twelve, twenty and again ten.
The girl receives them with professions of pleasure; her brother
will return the compliment to the giver. It is explained that no
return is looked for; the presents are from the king, who desires
to pass the night with her. (In <b>J</b> the king goes straight
to the wife, and says that he has her husband's permission.) The
lady affects to put herself at the king's disposition. She
appeals to her maid-servants, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; first her
"nurses," then her maids, <b>C</b>; one servant, and then
another, <b>H</b>. Which of them will enable her to keep her
word, change clothes with her, and pass the night with the king?
Only Maria, the youngest of all (of forty, <b>B</b>), is willing
to stead her mistress in this strait, <b>A</b>-<b>C</b>. In
<b>D</b>-<b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, there is but one nurse or
servant, and she assents, or follows her mistress's directions as
a matter of course. The servant is to have the king's present in
<b>D</b>. The substitute is elaborately combed and dressed, with
a gold band round her hair, and a beautiful ring on her finger.
At midnight, or before dawn, the king cuts off the finger that
has the ring, <b>A</b>, <b>I</b>, her finger, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>H</b> (fingers, <b>B</b>, v. 43), little finger,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>; takes the ring from her finger, <b>C</b>, all
the rings from her fingers, <b>J</b>. He also cuts off her hair
(braid), with its golden band, <b>B</b> (braids, v. 43),
<b>C</b>, <b>I</b>, her hair (braid), with the golden flowers,
<b>A</b>, with the pearl, <b>H</b>, right braid, <b>D</b>, braid,
<b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, extremity of her braid, <b>B</b>.
These are to serve as tokens; he puts them in his handkerchief,
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>. He takes his trophies to the assembly.
Maurianos has lost his wager, and is to be hanged. Where is
Maurianos, the braggart, and where his precious sister, whom no
gifts could seduce? Word comes to the sister. She dresses herself
beautifully, and makes her way into the assembly; she would fain
know why they are to hang Maurianos. 'I have seduced his sister,'
says the king, 'and I will hang Maurianos.' The girl demands
tokens. 'I cut off her finger, with the golden sapphire; I cut
off her hair, with the golden flowers (band).' She extends her
hand; the earth is filled with sapphires. 'See, lords! are
fingers of mine wanting?' She flings out her hair; the earth is
filled with flowers. 'See, lords! is a braid of mine wanting?'
(<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and the rest to the same effect.) Then she
turns to the king. 'It fits you no more to play the king,'
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. 'You have slept with my slave, and my slave
you shall be,' <b>C</b>-<b>I</b>. 'Take my mule and go fetch
wood.' In <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, the king has to marry Maria. In
<b>F</b>, John becomes king (as a consequence of winning the
wager). In <b>I</b>, the people depose the king and make
Maurianos's sister queen.</p>

<p>There are numerous tales in which a man wagers heavily upon a
woman's (generally his wife's) constancy, and, upon plausible
evidence, which in the end proves to be nugatory, is adjudged to
have lost.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d268_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> We are concerned only with a small section of
these stories, characterized by the circumstances that the woman
whose virtue is questioned puts another woman in her place in the
encounter with the assailant, and that the proofs of success
offered are a finger, finger-ring, and head, or braid, of
hair<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d268_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> (one of these, or more).</p>

<p>A rhymed tale of the thirteenth century, 'Von zwein
Kaufmannen,' by Ruprecht von W&uuml;rzburg,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d268_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> has the
following story, evidently French by origin. Bertram, a merchant
of Verdun, who has been happily married for ten years, is
required in the course of business to go to a fair at Provins.
While he is sitting at table in an inn with other merchants,
Hogier, the host, sets his guests to talking of their wives, and
three of them give a very bad account of their domestic
experiences. Bertram, when urged to take his turn, professes
himself the most fortunate of men, for his wife (Irmengard) is,
for beauty, sense, modesty, manners, the flower of womankind. The
host declares that the man is mad, and offers to stake all his
goods against Bertram's that he will seduce this peerless wife
within six months. The wager is accepted, and Bertram, to afford
an opportunity, sends his wife word that he shall be gone from
home longer than he had intended. Hogier goes to Verdun and takes
a lodging opposite to Bertram's house. He begins with presents
and messages to Irmengard; she treats these with contempt, and
threatens to make a complaint to her friends. He gives bounties
to the servants, who sing his praises to their mistress till they
are told that they will be thrashed if they continue. He then
gives a pound to Irmengard's favorite maid, Amelin, and
commissions her to offer a hundred mark if he may have his will;
and the wife proving to be both firm and indignant, he raises his
offer to two hundred mark, and finally to a thousand for one
night. Not only the maid, but Irmengard's own father and her
husband's father, to whom she successively appeals, urge her to
take this large sum, and assure her that she will incur her
husband's resentment if she does not. A way out of her
difficulties now occurs to her (which the author of the poem
represents as an express suggestion from God). She asks the maid
if she will give Hogier a night for the consideration of a
hundred mark; Amelin is ready so to do for half the money. Hogier
is told to pay in his thousand, and an appointment is made.
Irmengard receives him in Amelin's garb, and Amelin in
Irmengard's. In the morning Hogier asks for some jewel as a
keepsake, and the maid having nothing to give him, he cuts off
one of her fingers. He now calls upon Bertram to pay his forfeit.
Bertram has some doubt whether he has not been tricked. It is
mutually agreed that the matter shall be settled at a banquet
which Bertram is to give at Verdun. Bertram, upon his return
home, cannot conceal a deep depression. His wife asks him the
cause, and he opens his mind to her; she bids him be of good
cheer, for all Hogier's goods are theirs. At the banquet Hogier
states his case, and produces the finger in confirmation of his
claim. Irmengard, asked what answer she has to make, humorously
replies that she is sorry for her misbehavior, but all her
friends, there present, had advised her to commit it. She then
shows her hands, both unmarred. Amelin comes in and complains of
the treatment she has received. Hogier owns that he has lost, and
desires to become Bertram's 'poor man.' Amelin is given him as
wife, with her hundred mark for a dowry. Here we have wager,
substitution, finger cut off, as in the Scottish ballad and most
of the Romaic versions, and the loser marries the maid, as in the
Scottish ballad and Romaic <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>.</p>

<p>The Mabinogi of Taliesin, "in its present form not older than
the thirteenth century," has the incidents of the substitution of
the maid-servant, the finger and finger-ring, with the
modification that the wife's general high character, and not
simply her continence, is impugned and vindicated.</p>

<p>At a Christmas feast in the palace of King Maelgwn, the
company were discoursing of the unequalled felicity of the king,
upon whom heaven had bestowed, with every other good gift, a
queen whose virtues exceeded those of all the noble ladies in the
kingdom. Elphin, Maelgwn's nephew, said, None but a king may vie
with a king; otherwise he would say that his own wife was as
virtuous as any lady in the kingdom. Maelgwn was not there to
hear this boast, but it was duly reported to him, and he ordered
Elphin to be thrown into prison, pending a test of Elphin's wife
which he deputed his graceless son, Rhun, to make. Taliesin,
Elphin's bard, warned the lady that Rhun would try to put some
disgrace upon her, and advised that one of the servants should
personate her mistress when Rhun came to the house. Accordingly,
a kitchen-maid was dressed up in her mistress's clothes, and was
seated at the supper-table, her hands loaded with rings. Rhun
made his appearance and was welcomed by the disguised menial. He
fell to jesting with her, put a powder into her drink, which cast
her into a sound sleep, and cut off her little finger, on which
was Elphin's signet-ring. The king assembled his councillors, had
Elphin brought in from prison, and showed him the finger, which
(so Rhun had averred) had been cut from his wife's hand the
preceding night, while she was sunk in a drunken sleep. Elphin
could not deny that the ring was his, but he gave three
incontrovertible reasons why the finger could not be his wife's,
one of these being that the ring was too large to stay on his
wife's thumb, yet too small to go over the joint of the little
finger of the hand from which it had been cut; and the fact was
put beyond question by Taliesin's afterwards bringing in Elphin's
wife at a state-dinner, and displaying her unmutilated
hand.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d268_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A lively play of Jakob Ayrer's (about 1600) has the wager, the
substitution, the ring offered in evidence (as in Romaic
<b>C</b>, <b>G</b>), the marriage with the maid.</p>

<p>Claudius, master of the hunt to the Prince of Calabria, on the
eve of his departure on a voyage, is heard by two courtiers,
Leipolt and Se&uuml;bolt, soliloquizing on the excellences of his
wife, Frigia, her housekeeping, virtue, and love for him. They
wager all their goods against his that they will bring the woman
to do their will. One undertakes to present her wedding-ring, the
other her necklace, in proof of the achievement. Leipolt and
Se&uuml;bolt, always acting severally, attempt to buy the
services of Jahn T&uuml;rck, a quick-witted and loyal servant of
Claudius. He tells everything to his mistress, and by his advice
she dresses two of her maids in her clothes and lets them meet
the men, warning them to keep within bounds. Leipolt and
Se&uuml;bolt, each finding the supposed lady coy, are content to
secure the means of winning their wager, and, by Frigia's
connivance (who, it seems, had come to knowledge of the wager
through Jahn), one of them receives her ring, the other her
necklace, as pretended love-tokens. Claudius comes home. Leipolt
informs the prince of the wager, and asks Claudius whether he
knows the ring and will pay; Se&uuml;bolt brings out the
necklace. Claudius gives all for lost. The prince sends for
Frigia. She challenges the courtiers to say that she has
misbehaved with them. They own that they have never laid eyes on
her, but they recognize the maids when they are brought in, still
in their mistress's clothes. Frigia explains in detail. The
prince addresses his councillors (for such they are) in terms of
exemplary severity, and adjudges them to marry the maids, making
over one third of their property to these and another to
Claudius, or to lose their heads. (Compare the Scottish ballad at
the end.) They prefer to keep their heads.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d268_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A Danish ballad, very popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, has the wager (only on the part of the assailant), but
the story takes a different turn from the foregoing, for the
irresistible knight has simply a conversation with the lady, in
which he meets with a definitive repulse.</p>

(Iver) sit at the board talking of wives and fair maids. Peder
asserts that the maid lives not in the world whom he cannot
cajole with a word. Lange knows the maid so virtuous that neither
words nor gold can beguile. Peder wagers life (gold, goods,
house, land) and neck (halsbane) that she shall be his by the
morrow. He rides straightway to Ingelil, Thorlof's daughter, and
makes love to her in honorable phrase. Ingelil reminds him of two
ladies who have received the same professions from him and been
betrayed. If she will be his dear, every finger shall wear the
red gold: her father has nine gold rings, and would give them all
to her if she wished. If she will be his, she shall have a train
of servants, out and in: she is not halt or blind, and can go out
and in by herself. If he cannot have his will with her, it will
cost him his white halsbane: much better so than that he should
cheat her, or any honorable maid. Peder rides away sorrowful, for
lost is gold and his white halsbane besides.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d268_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> We have already
