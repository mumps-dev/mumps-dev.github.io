<p>O Bessy Bell and Mary Gray,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are twa bonny lasses;<br/>
They biggd a bower on yon Burn-brae,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And theekd it oer wi rashes.</p>

<p>Cunningham, Songs of Scotland, III, 60, gives, as recited to
him by Sir Walter Scott, four stanzas which are simply a with
'Lyndoch brae' substituted in the third for Sharpe's 'Stronach
haugh.' 'Dranoch haugh,' nearly as in <b>b</b>, is, as will
presently appear, the right reading. Sharpe's third stanza, with
the absurd variation of royal kin, occurs in a letter of his of
the date November 25, 1811 (Letters, ed. Allardyce, I, 504), and
is printed in the Musical Museum, IV, *203, ed. 1853.</p>

<p>In the course of a series of letters concerning the ballad in
The Scotsman (newspaper), August 30 to September 8, 1886, several
verses are cited with trivial variations from the texts here
given.</p>

<p>'Bessy Bell' was made into this nursery-song in England
(Halliwell's Nursery Rhymes of England, 1874, p. 246, No 484):</p>

<p>Bessy Bell and Mary Gray,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They were two bonny lasses;<br/>
They built their house upon the lea,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And covered it with rashes.</p>

<p>Bessy kept the garden-gate,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Mary kept the pantry;<br/>
Bessy always had to wait,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While Mary lived in plenty.</p>

<p>The most important document relating to Bessy Bell and Mary
Gray is a letter written June 21, 1781, by Major Barry, then
proprietor of Lednock, and printed in the Transactions of the
Society of the Antiquaries of Scotland, II, 108, 1822.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d201_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"When I came first to Lednock," says Major Barry, "I was shewn
in a part of my ground (called the Dranoch-haugh) an heap of
stones almost covered with briers, thorns and fern, which they
assured me was the burial place of Bessie Bell and Mary Gray.</p>

<p>"The tradition of the country relating to these ladys is, that
Mary Gray's father was laird of Lednock and Bessie Bell's of
Kinvaid, a place in this neighbourhood; that they were both very
handsome, and an intimate friend ship subsisted between them;
that while Miss Bell was on a visit to Miss Gray, the plague
broke out, in the year 1666; in order to avoid which they built
themselves a bower about three quarters of a mile west from
Lednock House, in a very retired and romantic place called
Burn-braes, on the side of Brauchieburn. Here they lived for some
time; but the plague raging with great fury, they caught the
infection, it is said, from a young gentle man who was in love
with them both. He used to bring them their provision. They died
in this bower, and were buried in the Dranoch-haugh, at the foot
of a brae of the same name, and near to the bank of the river
Almond. The burial-place lies about half a mile west from the
present house of Lednock.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d201_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"I have removed all the rubbish from this little spot of
classic ground, inclosed it with a wall, planted it round with
flowering shrubs, made up the grave double, and fixed a stone in
the wall, on which is engraved the names of Bessie Bell and Mary
[Gray]."</p>

<p>The estate passed by purchase to Thomas Graham, afterwards
Lord Lynedoch, who replaced the wall, which had become dilapi
dated in the course of half a century, with a stone parapet and
iron railing, and covered the grave with a slab inscribed, "They
lived, they loved, they died." This slab is now hidden under a
cairn of stones raised by successive pilgrims.</p>

<p>Major Barry's date of 1666 should be put back twenty years.
Perth and the neighborhood (Lednock is seven miles distant) were
fearfully ravaged by the plague in 1645 and a year or two
following. Three thousand people are said to have perished.
Scotland escaped the pestilence of 1665-6.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d201_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The young gentleman who is said to have brought food to Bessy
and Mary is sometimes described as the lover of both, sometimes
as the lover of one of the pair. Pennant says that the ballad was
"composed by a lover deeply stricken with the charms of both." In
the course of tradition, the lover is said to have perished with
the young women, which we might expect to happen if he brought
the contagion to the bower. But this lover, who ought to have had
his place in the song, appears only in tradition, and his reality
may be called in question. It is not rational that the young
women should seclude themselves to avoid the pest and then take
the risk of the visits of a person from the seat of the in
fection.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d201_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> To be sure it may be doubted, notwithstanding the
tenor of the ballad, whether the retirement of these young ladies
was voluntary, or at least whether they had not taken the plague
before they removed to their bower. In that case the risk would
have been for the lover, and would have been no more than he
might naturally assume.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d201_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
