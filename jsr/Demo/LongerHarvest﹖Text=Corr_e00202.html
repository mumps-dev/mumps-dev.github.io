<h3>2. The Elfin Knight</h3>

<p>P. 8 a, second paragraph. Russian ballad of Impossibilities propounded
reciprocally by youth and maid (including a shirt): Shein, Russkiya N. P.,
Plyasovuiya, Nos 85, 86, p. 231 f.</p>

<p>13. Another Clever Wench, in Hurwitz's Hebrew Tales, New York, 1847, p.
154, Nos 61, 62; or Sagen der Hebr&auml;er aus dem Englischen, u.s.w.,
Leipzig, 1828, p. 129, Nos 56, 57.</p>

<p>14 a, line 16. The Rusalka ballad, also in Trudy, III, 
190, No 7.</p>

<p>14 a, the first paragraph. In the third or "Forest" book of
the Mah&#257;-bh&#257;rata, chapters 311-313, is a story that
bears marks of being an ancient part of the compilation.
Yudhishthira and his four younger brothers are distressed with
thirst. The eldest sends these one after another in quest of
water. Each reaches a lake and hears a voice of a sprite in the
air, "I have the first claim on this lake. Do not drink till you
have answered my questions," drinks notwithstanding, and falls as
if dead. At last Yudhishthira goes himself, answers the
questions, and is offered boons by the sprite. He is very modest,
and asks the life of one of his two half-brothers only, not that
of either of his full brothers. Whereupon the sprite rewards his
virtue by bringing all four to life.</p>

<p>The riddles and questions are spun out at great length, and
many are palpable interpolations. A few examples may be given.
What is weightier (more reverend) than the earth? One's mother.
What is loftier than the heavens? One's father. What is fleeter
than the wind? The mind. What are more numerous than the blades
of grass? Thoughts. What does not close its eyes while asleep? A
fish. What is that which does not move after birth? An egg. What
is that which is without heart? A stone. And so on. A paraphrase
of parts of these chapters is given by Ed. Arnold, Indian Idylls,
Boston, 1883, pp. 212-235.</p>

<p>Similarly, in the Kath&#257;-sarit-s&#257;gara, chapter v, a
man escapes death by resolving an ogre's riddle. See Tawney's
translation, I, 26, and especially the note, where Benfey is
cited as comparing Mah&#257;-bh&#257;rata, XIII, 5883 ff.</p>
