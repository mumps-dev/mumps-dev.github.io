<p>This ballad was given in Percy's Reliques, III, 87, 1765,
"from a written copy, containing some improvements (perhaps modern
ones)." These improvements are execrable in style and in matter,
so far as there is new matter, but not in so glaring contrast
with the groundwork as literary emendations of traditional
ballads. Ritson reprinted in A Select Collection of English
Songs, II, 244, 1783, some broadside like that which was followed
by <b>c</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d106_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>'Sweet Willie' in Kinloch Manuscripts, V, 407 and VII, 197
(the latter printed in Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads, p.
96), and also a fragment with the same title in the Harris
Manuscript, fol. 20 f, No 15, are derived from the broadside
through recitation. A copy in Buchan's Manuscripts, I, 150, is
taken directly from print.</p>

<p>In other cases portions of the broadside appear to have
entered into combination with traditional verses belonging to
some other story, or possibly to some older form of this.</p>

<p>The Dean of Derry communicated to Percy 
in 1776 the following stanzas, which he wrote 
down from the recitation of his mother, Mrs. 
Barnard, wife of the Bishop of Derry.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d106_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Scott inserted in his Border Minstrelsy, III, 83, 1803, seven
stanzas under the title of 'The Lament of the Border Widow,'
which show broader traces of the sheet-ballad (1-3), and also, as
Aytoun has remarked, agreements with '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_26.html">The Three Ravens</a>' and with
'Fair Helen of Kirconnell' (57). 'The Lament of the Border
Widow,' "obtained from recitation in the Forest of Ettrick," has
been thought to relate to the execution of Cokburne, a
border-free booter, by James V. Those who are interested in such
random inventions (as, under pardon, they must be called) will
find particulars in Scott's introduction, and a repetition of the
same in Maidment's Scotish Ballads and Songs, Historical and
Traditionary, II, 170.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d106_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Again, there are six couplets in Johnson's Museum, p. 90, No
89, called, from the burden, 'Oh ono chrio,' which have a little
of The Border Widow, and incidentally of The Flower of
Serving-Men, winding up with sentiments of transcendent
elegance.</p>

<p>"Dr. Blacklock informed Burns that this song ... was composed
on the horrid massacre at Glencoe": Stenhouse's note, IV, 92.</p>

<p>The English broadside, which may reasonably be believed to be
formed upon a predecessor in the popular style, has been held to
have a common origin with the Scandinavian ballad 'Maid and
Stable Boy,' already spoken of under '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_63.html">Child Waters</a>' at p. 84 f of
this volume. The points of resemblance are that a maid cuts her
hair, dons man's clothes, and seeks service with a king. In the
end she is married to the king's son, or to a nobleman of his
court. The differences, in other respects, are considerable.</p>

<p>Percy's ballad is translated by Bodmer, I, 160; by Merk,
Ursinus, p. 79, and Bothe, p. 307; by D&ouml;ring, p. 329.</p>
