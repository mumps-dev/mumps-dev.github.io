<p><b>A</b> was printed in the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border,
II, 73, 1802, "chiefly" from Mrs. Brown's Manuscript; in fact,
with not quite forty petty alterations. Scott remarks that the
ballad has been popular in many parts of Scotland. Christie, I,
172, had heard it sung by an old Banffshire woman, who died in
1866, at the age of nearly eighty, with very little difference
from Scott's copy.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d089_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The resemblance of the verse in <b>A</b> 31, 'The boy stared
wild like a gray gose-hawke,' to one in 'Hardyknute,' 'Norse een
like gray gosshawk stared wild,' struck Sir Walter Scott as
suspicious, and led him "to make the strictest inquiry into the
authenticity of the song. But every doubt was removed by the
evidence of a lady of high rank [Lady Douglas of Douglas, sister
to Henry, Duke of Buccleuch, as we are informed in the edition of
1833], who not only recollected the ballad as having amused her
infancy, but could repeat many of the verses." It is quite
possible that Mrs. Brown may unconsciously have adopted this
verse from the tiresome and affected Hardyknute, so much esteemed
in her day. One would be only too glad were this the only
corruption which the ballad had undergone. On the contrary, while
not calling in question the substantial genuineness of the
ballad, we must admit that the form in which we have received it
is an enfeebled one, without much flavor or color; and some such
feeling no doubt affected Sir Walter's mind, more than the
reminiscence of 'Hardyknute,' which, of itself, is of slight
account.</p>

<p>A tale 'How the king of Estmure Land married the king's
daughter of Westmure Land' is mentioned in "The Complaint of
Scotland," and there has been considerable speculation as to what
this tale might be, and also as to what localities Estmure Land
and Westmure Land might signify. Seeing no clue to a settlement
of these questions, I pass them by, with the simple comment that
no king of Estmure Land marries the king of Westmure Land's
daughter in this ballad or any other.</p>

<p>Three kings (King Easter and King Wester, <b>A</b>, the
Eastmure king and the Westmure king, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and King
Honor, <b>A</b>, the king of Onorie, <b>B</b>, King Luve,
<b>C</b>), court a lady, and the third, who woos for womanhood
and beauty, <b>B</b>, wins her. The Eastmure king, <b>B</b>, the
Westmure, <b>C</b>, kills his successful rival on his
wedding-day. According to the prosaic, not at all ballad-like,
and evidently corrupted account in <b>A</b>, there is a rebellion
of nobles four months after the marriage, and a certain False
Foodrage takes it upon himself to kill the king. The murderer
spares the queen, and if she gives birth to a girl will spare her
child also, but if she bears a boy the boy is to die.</p>

<p>In <b>A</b> the queen escapes from custody before her time
comes, and gives birth to a boy in the swines' sty. Lots are cast
to see who shall go find the queen (the narrative is very vague
here), and the lot falls on Wise William, who sends his wife in
his stead. The queen induces this woman to exchange children with
her, Wise William's wife having a girl. After some years Wise
William reveals to the boy that he is rightful lord of the castle
(and we may suppose royal dignity) which False Foodrage has
usurped. The boy kills False Foodrage and marries Wise William's
daughter. Some of these incidents are wanting in <b>B</b>. For
Wise William's wife we have simply a poor woman in the town.</p>

<p>'Fause Foodrage' is closely related to a Scandinavian ballad,
especially popular in Denmark, where it is found in not less than
twenty-three manuscripts:</p>

<p><b>Danish</b>. <b>A</b>, 'Ung Villum,' Danske Viser, No 126,
III, 135, 66 stanzas; <b>B</b>, 'Vold og Mord,' Levninger, II,
64, No 12, 64 stanzas; <b>C</b>, 'Lille Villum,' Kristensen, I,
305, No 111, 15 stanzas; also, Tragica, No 18, not seen.</p>

<p><b>Icelandic</b>. 'Kv&aelig;&eth;i af Loga &iacute;
Vallarhl&iacute;&eth;,' &Iacute;slenzk fornkv&aelig;&eth;i, I,
235, No 28, 55 stanzas.</p>

<p><b>Swedish</b>. 'Helleman Unge,' Arwidsson, I, 
132, No 15, 13 stanzas (imperfect).</p>

<p><b>F&auml;r&ouml;e</b>, in imprinted copies. There are more
incidents in the Danish ballad, and too many, but something,
without doubt, has been lost from the English, which, however,
preserves these essential points: A man that has wedded a woman
who had another lover is killed by his competitor shortly after
his marriage; a boy is born, who is passed off as a girl; this
boy, before he has attained manhood, slays his father's
murderer.</p>

<p>In the Danish 'Young William,' <b>A</b>, Svend of Voldeslav,
rich in gold, woos Lisbet, who prefers William for his good
qualities. Svend shuts himself up in his room, sick with grief.
His mother and sister come and go. The mother will get him a
fairer maid, and gives him the good rede not to distress himself
about a girl that is plighted to another man. The sister gives a
bad rede, to kill William, and so get the bride. The mother
remarks that a son is coming into being who would revenge his
father's death. The business can be done, says Svend, before that
son is born, and immediately after takes occasion to meet William
as he is passing through a wood, and kills him. Forty weeks gone,
Lisbet gives birth to a son, but Svend is told that she has borne
a daughter. Young William attains to the age of eighteen, and is
a stalwart youth, given to games of strength. One day when he is
putting the stone with a peasant, the two fall out, and the
peasant, being roughly treated, calls out, You had better avenge
your father's death. Young William hastens to his mother, and
asks whether his father's death had been by violence, and, if so,
who killed him. The mother thinks him too young to wield a sword:
he must summon Svend to a court. This is done. Svend informs his
uncle that he is summoned to court by William, and asks what he
is to do. The uncle had always been told that Lisbet's child was
a girl. I shall never live to see the day, says Svend, when I
shall beat a woman at tricks. Svend goes to the court, attended
by many of his uncle's men. William charges him with the murder
of his father, for which no compensation has been offered. Svend
says not a penny will be paid, and William draws his sword and
cuts him down. For killing Svend William is summoned to court by
Svend's brother, Nilus. Nilus demands amends. William says they
are quit, with brother against father, and he will marry Nilus's
sister (whom he has already carried off). Never, says Nilus, for
which William finds it necessary to kill <i>him</i>. He then
rides to his mother, who asks what amends have been offered for
his father's death, and, on hearing that William has killed both
the murderer and his brother, clasps him to her heart, for all
her grief is now over.</p>

<p>No other Scandinavian copy besides Danish <b>A</b> has the
killing of Nilus, which may be regarded as an aftergrowth. In the
Icelandic version, the sister, so far from putting her brother up
to the murder, bursts into tears when her brother tells what he
has done, be cause she knows that revenge will follow. The
murderer offers himself to his former love in place of her
husband, at the very moment when she is bowed in anguish over the
dead body. She replies significantly, He is not far from me that
shall revenge him. All the Scandinavian copies have the three
chief points of the story except the Swedish, which lacks the
first half.</p>

<p>Another Scandinavian ballad has many of the features of 'Young
William:' <b>Danish</b>, 'Liden Engel,' <b>A</b>, Danske Viser,
No 127, III, 147; <b>B</b>, Levninger, II, 82, No 13; <b>C</b>,
Kristensen, I, 254, No 97, a fragment. <b>Norwegian</b>, 'Unge
Ingelbrett,' Bugge, p. 110, No 23, derived from the Danish.
According to Danish <b>A</b>, and for the most part <b>B</b>,
Liden Engel (who, by the way, is of Westerris) carries off a
bride by force. Her brother burns him and all his people in a
church in which they have taken refuge, the lady being saved by
lifting her on shields up to a window, whence she is taken by her
natural friends. It is the mother that suggests the setting of
the church on fire, and the first act of the daughter, after
getting out of the church with singed hair, is to fall on her
bare knees and pray that she may have a son who will take
vengeance on her brother. A son is born, and called after his
father, but his existence is as far as possible kept secret. As
he grows up his mother is always saying to him, Thine uncle was
the death of thy father. The boy wishes to serve the king; the
mother says, Go, but remember thy father's death. The king
observes that the youth has always a weight on his mind, and on
his asking the cause Little Engel answers that his uncle had
slain his father and paid no boot. The king says, If you wish to
revenge his death, as it is quite proper you should, I will lend
you three hundred men. When the uncle is in formed that Little
Engel is coming against him he declares that he had never heard
of such a person before: so the secret has been well kept. Little
Engel burns his uncle and all his people in a stone chamber in
which they had shut themselves up.</p>

<p>In the Norwegian-Danish ballad Engel, or Ingelbrett, the
second simply kills his uncle with a sword. The offence given in
this case is not the carrying off a bride by force, but the
omitting to ask the brother's consent to the marriage, though
that of all the rest of the family had been obtained: another
instance of the danger of such neglect in addition to those
already mentioned in the preface to '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_11.html">The Cruel Brother</a>,' I,
142.</p>

<p>'Fause Foodrage ' has some affinity with '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_90.html">Jellon Grame</a>.'</p>
