<li>'Willie's Lady,' Fraser-Tytler Manuscript</li>
<li>'Sweet Willy,' Jamieson-Brown Manuscript, No 15, fol. 33.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d00601.html"><i>Version A</i></a></p>

<p><b>a</b>, 'Willie's Lady,' was No 1 in the manuscript of
fifteen ballads furnished William Tytler by Mrs. Brown in 1783,
and having been written down a little later than b may be
regarded as a revised copy. This manuscript, as remarked under No
5, is not now in the possession of the Fraser-Tytler family,
having often been most liberally lent, and, probably, at last not
returned. But a transcript had been made by the grandfather of
the present family of two of the pieces contained in it, and
'Willie's Lady' is one of these two.</p>

<a name="Page_I_82"/>
<p>Lewis had access to William Tytler's copy, and, having
regulated the rhymes, filled out a gap, dropped the passage about
the girdle, and made other changes to his taste, printed the
ballad in 1801 as No 56 of his Tales of Wonder. The next year
Scott gave the "ancient copy, never before published," "in its
native simplicity, as taken from Mrs. Brown of Falkland's manuscript,"
&mdash; William Tytler's,&mdash; in Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, II, 27,
but not with literal accuracy. Jamieson, in 1806, gave 'Sweet
Willy,' almost exactly according to the text of his Brown
manuscript, in an appendix to the second volume of his
collection, p. 367, and at p. 175 of the same volume, a
reconstruction of the ballad which might have been spared.</p>

<p><b>b</b> lacks altogether the passage which makes proffer of
the cup, <b>a</b>, stanzas 5-11, and substitutes at that place the
girdle of a 21-28. The woodbine in <b>a</b> 36, 41, is also wanting, and
the concluding stanza. A deficiency both in matter and rhyme at a
32 is supplied by b 25, 26, but not happily:</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'An do you to your mither then,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An bid her come to your boy's christnen;</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'For dear 's the boy he 's been to you:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then notice well what she shall do.'</p>

<p>Again, the transition in <b>a</b>, from st. 33 to st. 34, is
abrupt even for a ballad, and <b>b</b> introduces here four
stanzas narrating the execution of the Billy Blind's injunctions,
and ending,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And notic'd well what she did say,</p>

<p>whereby we are prepared for the witch's exclamations.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d006_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Danish versions of this ballad are numerous:
<b>A</b>-<b>I</b>, 'Hustru og Mands Moder' [' Fostermoder,'
'Stifmoder'], Grundtvig, No 84, II, 404 ff: <b>J</b>-<b>T</b>,
'Hustru og Mands Moder,' Kristensen, II, 111 ff, No 35:
<b>U</b>-<b>X</b>, 'Barselkvinden,' Kristensen, I, 201 ff, No
74: <b>Y</b>, 'Hustru og Slegfred,' Grundtvig, No 85, II, 448 ff:
in all twenty-five, but many of Kristensen's copies are
fragments. Grundtvig's 84 <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and 85 <b>a</b> are from
manuscripts of the sixteenth century. 84 <b>F</b>-<b>I</b> and
several repetitions of 85 are of the seventeenth. Grundtvig's 84
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, and all Kristensen's versions, are
from recent oral tradition. Some of these, though taken down
since 1870, are wonderfully well preserved.</p>

<p>The Danish ballads divide into two classes, principally
distinguished by their employing or not employing of the artifice
of wax children. (There is but one of these in <b>N</b>,
<b>R</b>, Kristensen's <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, II, 116, 122, and in
the oldest Swedish ballad, as in the Scottish: but children in
Scandinavian ballads are mostly born in pairs.) Of the former
class, to which our only known copy belongs, are
<b>F</b>-<b>I</b>, <b>N</b>-<b>T</b>, <b>X</b> (Grundtvig, 84
<b>F</b>-<b>I</b>, Kristensen, II, No 35, <b>E</b>-<b>L</b>, I,
No 74 D). <b>N</b> and <b>I</b> furnish, perhaps, the most
consistent story, which, in the former, runs thus: Sir Peter
married Ellen (elsewhere Mettelille, Kirstin, Tidelil,
Ingerlil), and gave her in charge to his mother, a formidable
witch, and, as appears from <b>F</b>, violently opposed to the
match. The first night of her marriage Ellen conceived twins. She
wrapped up her head in her cloak and paid a visit to her
mother-in-law, to ask how long women go with child. The answer
was,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Forty weeks went Mary with Christ,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so each Danish woman must.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Forty weeks I went with mine,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But eight years shalt thou go with thine.'</p>

<p>The forty weeks had passed, and Ellen began to long for
relief. Sir Peter besought aid of his sister Ingerlin. If I help
your young bride, she said, I must be traitor to my mother. Sir
Peter insisted, and Ingerlin moulded a fine child of wax,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d006_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
wrapped it in linen, and exhibited it to her mother, who,
supposing that her
<a name="Page_I_83"/>
arts had been baffled, burst out into
exclamations of astonishment. She had thought she could twist a
rope out of flying sand, lay sun and moon flat on the earth with
a single word, turn the whole world round about! She had thought
all the house was spell-bound, except the spot where the young
wife's chest stood, the chest of red rowan, which nothing can bewitch!
The chest was instantly taken away, and Ellen's bed moved
to the place it had occupied; and no sooner was this done than
Ellen gave birth to two children.</p>

<p>In the ballads of the other class, the young wife, grown
desperate after eight years of suffering, asks to be taken back
to her maiden home. Her husband's mother raises objections: the
horses are in the meadow, the coachman is in bed. Then, she says,
I will go on my bare feet. The moment her husband learns her
wish, the carriage is at the door, but by the arts of the mother
it goes to pieces on the way, and the journey has to be finished
on horseback. The joy of her parents at seeing their daughter
approaching was quenched on a nearer view: she looked more dead
than quick. She called her family about her and distributed her
effects. A great wail went up in the house when two sons were cut
from the mother's side. (<b>C</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>,
<b>W</b>: Grundtvig, 84 <b>C</b>; Kristensen, II, No 35 <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>; I, No 74 <b>C</b>.)</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first son stood up and brushed his hair:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Most surely am I in my ninth year.'</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second stood up both fair and red:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Most sure we'll avenge our dear mother dead.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d006_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Several of the most important ballads of the first class have
taken up a part of the story of those of the second class, to the
detriment of consistency. <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>O</b>,
<b>P</b> (Grundtvig, 84 <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, Kristensen,
II, No 35 <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>), make the wife quit her husband's
house for her father's, not only without reason, but against
reason. If the woman is to die, it is natural enough that she
should wish to die with the friends of her early days, and away
from her uncongenial mother-in-law; but there is no kind of
occasion for transferring the scene of the trick with the wax
children to her father's house; and, on the other hand, it is
altogether strange that her husband's mother and the rowan-tree
chest (which sometimes appears to be the property of the mother,
sometimes that of the wife) should go with her.</p>

<p><b>Y</b>, 'Hustru og Slegfred,' Grundtvig, 85, agrees with the
second class up to the point when the wife is put to bed at her
mother's house, but with the important variation that the spell
is the work of a former mistress of the husband; instead of his
mother, as in most of the ballads, or of the wife's
foster-mother, as in <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>M</b> (Grundtvig, 84 <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, Kristensen, II, No 35
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>), or of the wife's step-mother as in
<b>A</b> only. The conclusion of 'Hustru og Slegfred' is rather
flat. The wife, as she lies in bed, bids all her household hold
up their hands and pray for her relief, which occurs on the same
day. The news is sent to her husband, who rejoins his wife, is
shown his children, praises God, and burns his mistress. Burning
is also the fate of the mother-in-law in B, I, O, P, whereas in F
she dies of chagrin, and in <b>G</b> bursts into a hundred flinders
(flentsteene).</p>

<p>This ballad, in the mixed form of <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>
(Kristensen, II, 35 <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>), has been resolved into a
tale in Denmark, a few lines of verse being retained. Recourse is
had by the spellbound wife to a cunning woman in the village,
who informs her that in her house there is a place in which a
rowan-tree chest has stood, and that she can get relief there.
The cunning woman subsequently pointing out the exact spot, two
boys are born, who are seven years old, and can both walk and
talk. Word is sent the witch that her son's wife has been
delivered of two sons, and that she herself shall be burned the
day following. The witch says, "I have been able to twine a
string out of running water. If I have not succeeded in
bewitching the woman, she must have found the place where the
damned rowan chest stood." (Grundtvig, III, 858, No 84 <b>b</b>.)</p>

<p>Three Swedish versions of the ballad have been printed.
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, from tradition of this
<a name="Page_I_84"/>
century, are given by
Arwidsson, II, 252 ff, 'Liten Kerstins F&ouml;rtrollning,' No 134.
These resemble the Danish ballads of the second class closely.
Liten Kerstin goes to her mother's house, gives birth to two
children, and dies. In <b>A</b> the children are a son and daughter. The
son stands up, combs his hair, and says, "I am forty weeks on in
my ninth year." He can run errands in the village, and the
daughter sew red silk. In <b>B</b> both children are boys. One combs his
hair, and says, "Our grandmother shall be put on two wheels."
The other draws his sword, and says, "Our mother is dead, our
grandmother to blame. I hope our mother is with God. Our grandmother
shall be laid on seven wheels." The other copy, <b>C</b>,
mentioned by Grundtvig as being in Cavallius and Stephens'
manuscript collection, has been printed in the Svenska
Fornminnesforeningens Tidskrift, vol. ii, p. 72 ff, 1873-74. It
dates from the close of the sixteenth century, and resembles the
mixed ballads of the Danish first class, combining the flitting
to the father's house with the artifice of the wax children. The
conclusion of this ballad has suffered greatly. After the two
sons are born, we are told that Kirstin, before unmentioned, goes
to the chest and makes a wax child. If the chest were moved, Elin
would be free of her child. And then the boy stands up and
brushes his hair, and says he has come to his eighth year.</p>

<p>Three stanzas and some of the incidents of a Norwegian version
of this ballad have been communicated to Grundtvig, III, 858 f,
No 84 <b>c</b>, by Professor Sophus Bugge. The only place which was
unaffected by a spell was where Signel&iacute;ti's bride-chest stood,
and the chest being removed, the birth took place. The witch was
a step-mother, as in Danish <b>A</b>.</p>

<p>There are two familiar cases of malicious arrest of childbirth
in classic mythology, &mdash; those of Latona and Alcmene. The wrath of
Juno was the cause in both, and perhaps the myth of Alcmene is
only a repetition of an older story, with change of name. The
pangs of Latona were prolonged through nine days and nights, at
the end of which time Ilithyia came to her relief, induced by a
bribe. (Hymn to the Delian Apollo, 91 ff.) Homer, II. xix, 119,
says only that Hera stopped the delivery of Alcmene and kept back
Ilithyia. Antoninus Liberalis, in the second century of our era,
in one of his abstracts from the Metamorphoses of Nicander, a
poem of the second century B.C., or earlier, has this account:
that when Alcmene was going with Hercules, the Fates and
Ilithyia, to please Juno, kept her in her pains by sitting down
and folding their hands; and that Galinthias, a playmate and
companion of Alcmene, fearing that the suffering would drive her
mad, ran out and announced the birth of a boy, upon which the
Fates were seized with such consternation that they let go their
hands, and Hercules immediately came into the world. (Antoninus
Lib., Metam. c. xxix.) Ovid, Metamorphoses, ix, 281-315, is more
circumstantial. After seven days and nights of torture, Lucina
came, but, being bribed by Juno, instead of giving the aid for
which she was invoked, sat down on the altar before Alcmene's
door, with the right knee crossed over the left, and fingers
interlocked, mumbling charms which checked the processes of
birth. Galanthis, a servant girl <i>media de plebe</i>, was
shrewd enough to suspect that Juno had some part in this
mischief; and besides, as she went in and out of the house, she
always saw Lucina sitting on the altar, with her hands clasped
over her knees. At last, by a happy thought, she called out,
"Whoever you are, wish my mistress joy; she is lighter, and has
her wish." Lucina jumped up and unclasped her hands, and the
birth followed instantly. Pausanias, ix, 11, tells a similar but
briefer story, in which Historis, daughter of Tiresias, takes the
place of Galanthis. See, for the whole matter, 'Ilithyia oder die
Hexe,' in C.A. B&ouml;ttiger's Kleine Schriften, I, 76 ff.</p>

<p>Apuleius, in his Metamorphoses, mentions a case of suspended
childbirth, which, curiously enough, had lasted eight years,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d006_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
as in the Danish
<a name="Page_I_85"/>
and Swedish ballads. The witch is a mistress of
her victim's husband, as in Grundtvig, 85, and as in a story
cited by Scott from Heywood's 'Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels,'
p. 474. "There is a curious tale about a Count of Westeravia
[Vestravia, in diocesi Argentoratensi], whom a deserted concubine
bewitched upon his marriage, so as to preclude all hopes of his
becoming a father. The spell continued to operate for three
years, till one day, the count happening to meet with his former
mistress, she maliciously asked him about the increase of his
family. The count, conceiving some suspicion from her manner,
craftily answered that God had blessed him with three fine
children; on which she exclaimed, like Willie's mother in the
ballad, 'May Heaven confound the old hag by whose counsel I
threw an enchanted pitcher into the draw-well of your palace!'
The spell being found and destroyed, the count became the father
of a numerous family."</p>

<p>A story like that of the ballad is told as a fact that took
place in Arran within this century. A young man forsook his
sweetheart and married another girl. When the wife's time came,
she suffered excessively. A pack-man who was passing suspected
the cause, went straight to the old love, and told her that a
fine child was born; when up she sprang, and pulled out a large
nail from the beam of the roof, calling out to her mother, "
Muckle good your craft has done!" The wife was forthwith
delivered. (Napier, in The Folklore Record, II, 117.)</p>

<p>In the Sicilian tales, collected by Laura Gonzenbach, Nos 12
and 15, we have the spell of folded hands placed between the
knees to prevent birth, and in No 54 hands raised to the
head.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d006_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In all these examples the spell is finally broken by
telling the witch a piece of false news, which causes her to
forget herself and take away her hands. (Sicilianische
M&auml;rchen aus dem Volksmund gesammelt, Leipzig, 1870.)</p>

<p>We find in a <b>Roumanian</b> tale, contributed to Das Ausland
for 1857, p. 1029, by F. Obert, and epitomized by Grundtvig, III,
859, No 84 <b>d</b>, a wife condemned by her offended husband to go with
child till he lays his hand upon her. It is twenty years before
she obtains grace, and the son whom she then bears immediately
slays his father. A <b>Wallachian</b> form of this story (Walachische
M&auml;rchen von Arthur u. Albert Schott, No 23) omits the revenge by
the new-born child, and ends happily.</p>

<p>With respect to the knots in st. 34, it is to be observed that
the tying of knots (as also the fastening of locks), either
during the marriage ceremony or at the approach of parturition
was, and is still, believed to be effectual for preventing
conception or childbirth. The minister of Logierait, Perthshire,
testifies, about the year 1793, that immediately before the
celebration of a marriage it is the custom to loosen carefully
every knot about bride and bridegroom, &mdash; garters, shoe-strings,
etc. The knots are tied again before they leave the church.
(Statistical Account of Scotland, v, 83.) So among the Laps and
Norwegians, when a child is to be born, all the knots in the
woman's clothes, or even all the knots in the house, must be
untied, because of their impeding delivery. (Liebrecht, Zur
Volkskunde, p. 322, who also cites the Statistical Account of
Scotland.)</p>
