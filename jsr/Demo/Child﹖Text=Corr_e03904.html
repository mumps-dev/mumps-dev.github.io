might be the work of some poetical clergyman or schoolmaster:

Communicated to Scott by Major Henry Hutton, Royal Artillery,
24th December, 1802, as recollected by his father "and the
family:" Letters I, No 77. Major Hutton intimates that stanzas
46-49 of the first edition of 'Tamlane' ('Roxburgh was my
grandfather,' ff., corresponding to <b>I</b> 28-32) should be
struck out, and his verses inserted. But 4-12 of Hutton's stanzas
