<h3>39. Tam Lin</h3>

<p>'The Tayl of the &#541;ong Tamlene' is spoken of as told among a
company of shepherds, in Vedderburn's Complaint of Scotland,
1549. 'Thom of Lyn' is mentioned as a dance of the same party, a
little further on, and 'Young Thomlin' is the name of an air in a
medley in Wood's Manuscript, inserted, as David Laing thought,
between 1600 and 1620, and printed in Forbes's Cantus, 1666
(Stenhouse's ed. of The Scots Musical Museum, 1853, rv, 440). 'A
ballett of Thomalyn' is licensed to Master John Wallye and
Mistress Toye in 1558 (Arber, Registers of the Company of
Stationers, 1, 22).</p>

<p>This fine ballad stands by itself, and is not, as might have
been expected, found in possession of any people but the
Scottish. Yet it has connections, through the principal feature
in the story, the retransformation of Tam Lin, with Greek
popular tradition older than Homer. There is a Cretan fairy tale
cited by Bernhard Schmidt (Volksleben der Neugriechen, pp.
115-117) which comes surprisingly near to the principal event of
the Scottish ballad. A young peasant, who was a good player on
the rote, used to be taken by the nereids into their grotto, for
the sake of his music. He fell in love with one of them, and, not
knowing how to help himself, had recourse to an old woman of his
village. She gave him this advice: that just before cock-crow he
should seize his beloved by the hair, and hold on, unterrified,
till the cock crew, whatever forms she should assume. The peasant
gave good heed, and the next time he was taken into the cave fell
to playing, as usual, and the nereids to dancing. But as
cock-crow drew nigh, he put down his instrument, sprang upon the
object of his passion, and grasped her by her locks. She
instantly changed shape; became a dog, a snake, a camel, fire.
But he kept his courage and held on, and presently the cock crew,
and the nereids vanished, all but one. His love returned to her
proper beauty, and went with him to his home. After the lapse of
a year she bore a son, but in all this time never uttered a word.
The good husband was fain to ask counsel of the old woman again,
who told him to heat the oven hot, and say to his wife that if
she would not speak he would throw the boy into the oven. He
acted upon this prescription; the nereid cried out, 'Let go my
child, dog!' tore the infant from his arms, and vanished.</p>

<p>This Cretan tale, recovered from tradition even later than our
ballad, repeats all the important circumstances of the forced
marriage of Thetis with Peleus (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca, m, 13,
5, 6). The Cretan tale does not differ from the one repeated by
Apollodorus frc-.a earlier writers a couple of thousand years ago
more than two versions of a story gathered from oral tradition in
these days are apt to do. Whether it has come down to our time
from mouth to mouth through twenty-four centuries or more, or
whether, having died out of the popular memory, it was
reintroduced through literature, is a question that cannot be
decided with certainty; but there will be nothing unlikely in the
former supposition to those who bear in mind the tenacity of
tradition among people who have never known books.</p>
