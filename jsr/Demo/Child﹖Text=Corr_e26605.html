<h3>266. John Thomson and the Turk</h3>


<p>P. 3 b. There may be added another Little-Russian story
communicated to me in translation by Professor Wollner:
Ethnographic Survey, etc. (Etnografi&#269;eskoe Obozr&#277;nie,
etc.) Moscow, 1893, V, 104.</p>

<p>A tsar and a tsarina, when dying, charged their son Soliman
not to marry a woman older than himself. This, however, he did,
and his wife hated him, and one day, when he was hunting, went
off to her brother, ordering the servants to say that she had
died. This report the servants duly made, but Soliman knew that
his wife had gone to her brother, and he felt the loss so much
that he could not keep away from her. Meeting a boy in tattered
clothes, he changed with him, gave the boy everything he had on
except his ring, and put on rags, to play the beggar. He
proceeded to the brother's house, and seeing his wife sitting at
a window, held out his hand, on which his ring was sparkling, and
asked an alms. His wife knew him at once by the ring, and bade
him come in. 'Who are you?' she asked. 'Once I was a tsar,' he
said, 'but my wife died, and I became a beggar.' At this point
the brother arrived on the scene. The woman told Soliman to lie
down on the threshold; he did so, and she sat down on him. When
her brother came in she said, 'Guess what I am sitting on.' He
answered, 'On the threshold.' 'Wrong,' said she; 'on Tsar
Soliman.' 'If it is he,' said her brother, 'I will cut his head
off.' But here Soliman suggested that if the brother should take
his head off on the spot, nobody would know that he had killed a
tsar; whereas if he would build a three-story gallows and hang
Soliman on it, all the world would see that he had been the death
of a tsar and not of a beggar. So a three-story gallows was
built, and as they were taking Soliman up to the first stage, he
said, Give me a horn, to cheer my heart for the last time. They
gave him a horn and he began to blow, Quick, quick, dear
soldiers, for my death and end is nigh. A black regiment set out
for the place. Bystanders said, Tsar Soliman, you are up high and
see far: what is the black thing coming along the hill? 'My
death, which gleams black in the distance.' Soliman mounted to
the second stage and blew his horn again: Quick, quick, dear
soldiers, my death and end is nigh. He saw a white regiment
coming. The people said, Tsar Soliman, you are high up and see
far: what is that white thing which is coming? My death, which
gleams white in the distance. Then Soliman mounted to the third
stage and blew Quick, quick, dear soldiers, my death and end is
nigh, and he saw a red regiment coming. The people asked, what
red thing was coming. My death, which gleams red in the
distance.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_e26605_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Then the black regiment came up, after it the
white, and finally the red; they slew Soliman's wife and her
brother, took Soliman down from the gallows, and rode home.</p>

<p>8. <b>Danish</b>. Through the friendly help of Dr. Axel Olrik
I am now in a position to say that there is one fundamental text
<b>A</b>, in Manuscripts of 1600 and 1615, from which all the
others are derived. In the seventeenth century <b>A</b> was
expanded from forty to eighty-two couplets. <b>B</b>, the
original of the expanded copy, is found in a Manuscript of 1635;
from <b>B</b> come the other five later Manuscript texts, the
flying-sheet of 1719, Kristensen's fragment, and some recent
copies.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. King David, after betrothing the incomparable
Suol-far, has to go on a cruise. He proposes that the lady stay
with his mother while he is away, but Suol-far does not like this
arrangement. Then, says the king, I shall bind your finger with
gold, so that I can find you wherever you may be. Hardly is King
David gone, when King Adell rides up. Suol-far is out of doors,
brushing her hair; Adell asks if he may put a gold crown on it.
If God grants King David to come home with honor, she will soon
have a gold crown to wear, she says. Adell wishes to hear no more
of David, and asks Suol-far to plight herself to him; she will
not, she has given her troth to King David. Adell gives her
sleeping potions five, sleeping potions nine; she swoons, is
taken to be dead, and is buried in the church. Late in the
evening Adell goes to the tomb; the effect of the potions having
passed off, Suol-far rises. Adell asks her to go off with him,
and after some tears Suol-far permits him to take her away. It
had been supposed that there was no witness, but a little page
was listening, and when King David came home the page gave him
the bad tidings that King Adell had carried Suol-far out of the
country. David goes in quest, disguised as a pilgrim. He finds
the pair sitting on a stone, resting their weary legs, and asks
an alms. Adell gives something, and Suol-far is at least about so
to do, for David asks, Is it not the way in this country to give
money with bare hand? whereupon she pulls off her glove and
gives. David (seeing of course the token on her finger) draws his
sword and kills Adell. He then asks Suol-far how she came to
break her troth. Adell gave her nine drinks, which made her fall
dead to the earth, but, thank God, she had been kept from sin.
David loves her so dearly that he is easily satisfied; he orders
his wedding, and their troubles are over.</p>

<p>The flying-sheet of 1719 (in seventy-three couplets) exhibits
some differences. King David marries S&oslash;lfehr before he
goes on his expedition, and gives the land into Adel's care
during his absence. After the queen has fallen aswoon in
consequence of the nine drinks, King Adel sends word to King
David that she is dead. After the interment, Adel remains in the
church and digs up S&oslash;lfehr. He addresses her as his
dearest; she refuses to be so called. Adel tells her that David
is dead, and asks her if she will follow him out of the land. She
will follow him very willingly if she may hear of no grief to
King David (whatever that may mean), and Adel wraps her in a
cloak and lifts her on his gray. There had been watchmen in the
church, and they tell David that Adel is off with S&oslash;lfehr.
David has pilgrim's clothes made for himself and many of his men.
While asking alms, David gives the queen to understand that he is
her husband; then turning to Adel says, I entrusted my kingdom to
you, and did not look to be deceived. Upon this he orders his
troop to spare none of Adel's men, and himself hews Adel in
pieces. The queen falls at his feet and begs forgiveness. The
easy king says, I know the fault was not thine, lifts her on his
horse, and goes home.</p>

<p>The two <b>Swedish</b> copies in Stephen's collection are
fragments of eight and of fifteen stanzas. In the first (from
S&oslash;dermanland), King David having dug up the coffin and
found it empty, disguises himself as a pilgrim, and when asking
an alms of Solfager says,</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Travelled have I by water and land,<br/>
But never took alms from a gloved hand.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>'Who are you for a vagabond, that never took alms from a
gloved hand?' says Solfager. 'Never was I a vagabond, but often
have I kissed Solfager's hand,' he replies. Solfager jumps into
his arms, exclaiming, I never can believe you are my former
true-love.</p>

<p>In the other (from Sm&aring;land), after the abduction of
Solfager, David takes staff in hand and goes to a strange land.
He presents himself where the pair are sitting at table, and asks
an alms. Solfager gives him alms once and twice, but the beggar
is not satisfied. Needy vagrant, she says, take alms where you
can; insatiable vagrant, take alms where you get most. I was no
vagrant, he answers, when I put gold rings on Solfager's arm; I
was no vagrant when I slept by Solfager. Her tears come; she can
never believe that he is David, her true-love. She takes David in
her arms. Praise to God, he cries, that I am still her
husband!</p>
