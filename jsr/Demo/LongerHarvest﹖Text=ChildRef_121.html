<h3>Robin Hood and the Potter</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Library of the University of Cambridge,
Manuscript E e. 4. 35, fol. 14 b, of about 1500. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d12101.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Printed from the manuscript in Ritson's Robin Hood, 1795, I,
81; here from a transcript of the original, carefully revised by
Rev. Professor Skeat.</p>

<p>Robin Hood sees a potter driving over the lea; the potter has
been in the habit of passing that way, and never has paid toll.
Little John has had a brush with the potter, and offers to lay
forty shillings that no man can make him leave a pledge. Robin
accepts the wager, stops the potter, and demands a "pledge"; the
potter refuses to leave pledge or pay toll, takes a staff from
his cart, knocks Robin's buckler out of his hand, and, ere Robin
can recover it, fells him with a blow in the neck. Robin owns
that he has lost. The potter says it is no courtesy to stop a
poor yeoman thus; Robin agrees heartily, and proposes fellowship,
also to change clothes with the potter and sell his ware at
Nottingham. The potter is willing; John warns his master to
beware of the sheriff. Robin takes his stand near the sheriff's
gate, and offers his pots so cheap that soon there are but five
left; these he sends as a gift to the sheriff's wife, who in
return asks him to dinner. While they are at their meal, two of
the sheriff's men talk of a shooting-match for forty shillings:
this the potter says he will see, and after a good dinner goes
with the rest to the butts. All the archers come half a bow's
length short of the mark; Robin, at his wish, gets a bow from the
sheriff, and his first shot misses the mark by less than a foot,
his second cleaves the central pin in three. The sheriff
applauds; Robin says there is a bow in his cart which he had of
Robin Hood. The sheriff wishes he could see Robin Hood, and the
potter offers to gratify this wish on the morrow. They go back to
the sheriff's for the night, and early the next day set forth;
the sheriff riding, the potter in his cart. When they come to the
wood, the potter blows his horn, for so they shall know if Robin
be near; the horn brings all Robin's men. The sheriff would now
give a hundred pound not to have had his wish; had he known his
man at Nottingham, it would have been a thousand year ere the
potter had come to the forest. I know that well, says Robin, and
therefore shall you leave your horse with us, and your other
gear. Were it not for your wife you would not come off so
lightly. The sheriff goes home afoot, but with a white palfrey,
which Robin presents to his wife. Have you brought Robin home?
asks the dame. Devil speed him, answers her spouse, he has taken
everything from me; all but this fair palfrey, which he has sent
to thee. The merry dame laughs, and swears that the pots have
been well paid for. Robin asks the potter how much his pots were
worth, gives him ten pounds instead of the two nobles for which
they could have been sold, and a welcome to the wood whenever he
shall come that way.</p>

<p>The Play of Robin Hood, an imperfect copy of which is printed
at the end of Copland's and of White's edition of The Gest, is
founded on the ballads of Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar and of
Robin Hood and the Potter. The portion which is based on the
ballad of Robin and the Potter is given in an appendix.</p>

<p>Robin Hood and the Butcher, No 122, repeats many of the
incidents of the present ballad. The sheriff is enticed into the
forest (by Little John instead of Robin Hood) in The Gest, 181
ff. This part of the story, in Robin Hood and the Butcher, is
much more like that of The Gest than it is in Robin Hood and the
Potter. We shall have only too many variations of the adventure
in which Robin Hood unexpectedly meets his match in a
hand-to-hand fight, now with a pinder, then with a tanner,
tinker, shepherd, beggar, etc. His adversaries, after proving
their mettle, are sometimes invited and induced to join his
company: not so here. In some broadside ballads of this
description, with an extravagance common enough in imitations,
Robin Hood is very badly mauled, and made all but
contemptible.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d121_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In Robin Hood and the Potter, Little John is
willing to wager on the result of a trial, from his own
experience. Will Scadlock is equally confident in Robin Hood and
the Curtal Friar, perhaps for the same reason, although this is
not said. In Robin Hood and the Shepherd, Little John takes his
turn after his master, and so with three of Robin's men in Robin
Hood and the Beggar, No 133.</p>

<p>Hereward the Saxon introduces himself into the Norman court as
a potter, to obtain information of an attack which William the
Conqueror was thought to intend on his stronghold at Ely: De
Gestis Herwardi Saxonis, 24, in Michel, Chroniques
Anglo-Normandes, II, 69, attributed to the twelfth century.
Wallace, in like manner, to scout in the English camp: Blind
Harry's poem, ed. Moir, Book Six, v. 435 ff, p. 123 ff. This is
also one of the many artifices by which Eustace the Monk deceives
his enemy, the Count of Boulogne: Roman d'Eustache le Moine, ed.
Michel, p. 39, v. 1071 ff, a poem of the thirteenth century. See,
for Hereward and Eustace, T. Wright's Essays on Subjects
connected with the Literature, etc., of England in the Middle
Ages, II, 108 ff, 135.</p>

<p>Disguise is the wonted and simplest expedient of an outlaw
mixing among his foes, "wherein the pregnant enemy does much."
Fulk Fitz Warine takes the disguise of an old monk, a merchant, a
charcoal-burner; Hereward, that of a potter, a fisherman; Eustace
the Monk, of a potter, shepherd, pilgrim, charcoal-burner, woman,
leper, carpenter, minstrel, etc.; Wallace, of a potter, pilgrim,
woman (twice), etc., in Blind Harry's poem, of a beggar in
ballads; Robin Hood, of a potter, butcher, beggar, shepherd, an
old woman, a fisherman (?), Guy of Gisborne.</p>
