<h3>18. Sir Lionel</h3>

<p>One half of <b>A</b> (the second and fourth quarters) is
wanting in the Percy Manuscript. <b>B</b> can be traced in
Banffshire for more than a hundred years, through the old woman
that sang it, and her forbears. What we can gather of the story
is this. A knight finds a lady sitting in (or under) a tree, who
tells him that a wild boar has slain (or worried) her lord and
killed (or wounded) thirty of his men. The knight kills the boar,
and seems to have received bad wounds in the process. The boar
belonged to a giant, or to a wild woman. The knight is required
to forfeit his hawks and leash and the little finger of his right
hand (or his horse, his hound, and his lady). He refuses to
submit to such disgrace, though in no condition to resist; the
giant allows him time to heal his wounds, and he is to leave his
lady as security for his return. At the end of the time the
knight comes back sound and well, and kills the giant as he had
killed the boar. <b>C</b> and <b>D</b> say nothing of the knight
having been wounded. The wild woman, to revenge her "pretty
spotted pig," flies fiercely at him, and he cleaves her in two.
The last quarter of the Percy copy would, no doubt, reveal what
became of the lady who was sitting in the tree, as to which
traditional copies give no light.</p>

<p>The ballad has much in common with the romance of 'Sir
Eglamour of Artois' (Percy Manuscript, Hales and Furnivall, n,
338; Thornton Romances, ed. Halliwell, p. 121). It has also taken
up something from the romance of 'Eger and Grime' (Percy
Manuscript, I, 341; Laing, Early Metrical Tales, p. 1).</p>
