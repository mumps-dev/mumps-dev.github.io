<p>In the year 1476 a Portuguese squadron seized a richly loaded
ship commanded by John Barton, in consequence of which letters of
reprisal were granted to Andrew, Robert, and John Barton, sons of
John, and these letters were renewed in 1506, "as no opportunity
had occurred of effectuating a retaliation;" that is to say, as
the Scots, up to the later date, had not been supplied with the
proper vessels. The king of Portugal remonstrated against
reprisals for so old an offence, but he had put himself in the
wrong four years before by refusing to deal with a herald sent by
the Scottish king for the arrangement of the matter in dispute.
It is probable that there was justice on the Scottish side, "yet
there is some reason to believe that the Bartons abused the royal
favor, and the distance and impunity of the sea, to convert this
retaliation into a kind of piracy against the Portuguese trade,
at that time, by the discoveries and acquisitions in India,
rendered the richest in the world." All three of the brothers
were men of note in the naval history of Scotland. Andrew is
called Sir Andrew, perhaps, in imitation of Sir Andrew Wood; but
his brother attained to be called Sir Robert.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d167_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>We may now hear what the writers who are nearest to the time
have to say of the subject-matter of our ballad.</p>

<p>Hall's Chronicle, 1548. In June [1511], the king being at
Leicester, tidings were brought to him that Andrew Barton, a
Scottish man and a pirate of the sea, saying that the king of
Scots had war with the Portingales, did rob every nation, and so
stopped the king's streams that no merchants almost could pass,
and when he took the Englishmen's goods, he said they were
Portingales' goods, and thus he haunted and robbed at every
haven's mouth. The king, moved greatly with this crafty pirate,
sent Sir Edmund Howard, Lord Admiral of England,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d167_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and Lord
Thomas Howard, son and heir to the Earl of Surrey, in all the
haste to the sea, which hastily made ready two ships, and without
any more abode took the sea, and by chance of weather were
severed. The Lord Howard, lying in the Downs, perceived where
Andrew was making toward Scotland, and so fast the said lord
chased him that he overtook him, and there was a sore battle. The
Englishmen were fierce, and the Scots defended them manfully, and
ever Andrew blew his whistle to encourage his men, yet for all
that, the Lord Howard and his men, by clean strength, entered the
main deck; then the Englishmen entered on all sides, and the
Scots fought sore on the hatches, but in conclusion Andrew was
taken, which was so sore wounded that he died there; then all the
remnant of the Scots were taken, with their ship, called The
Lion. All this while was the Lord Admiral in chase of the bark of
Scotland called Jenny Pirwyn, which was wont to sail with The
Lion in company, and so much did he with other that he laid him
on board and fiercely assailed him, and the Scots, as hardy and
well stomached men, them defended; but the Lord Admiral so
encouraged his men that they entered the bark and slew many, and
took all the other. Then were these two ships taken, and brought
to Blackwall the second day of August, and all the Scots were
sent to the Bishop's place of York, and there remained, at the
king's charge, till other direction was taken for them. [They
were released upon their owning that they deserved death for
piracy, and appealing to the king's mercy, says Hall.] The king
of Scots, hearing of the death of Andrew of Barton and taking of
his two ships, was wonderful wroth, and sent letters to the king
requiring restitution according to the league and amity. The king
wrote with brotherly salutations to the king of Scots of the
robberies and evil doings of Andrew Barton, and that it became
not one prince to lay a breach of a league to another prince in
doing justice upon a pirate or thief, and that all the other
Scots that were taken had deserved to die by justice if he had
not extended his mercy. (Ed. of 1809, p. 525.)</p>

<p>Buchanan, about twenty years later, writes to this effect.
Andrew Breton<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d167_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> was a Scots trader whose father had been
cruelly put to death by the Portuguese, after they had plundered
his ship. This outrage was committed within the dominion of
Flanders, and the Flemish admiralty, upon suit of the son, gave
judgment against the Portuguese; but the offending parties would
not pay the indemnity, nor would their king compel them, though
the king of Scots sent a herald to make the demand. The Scot
procured from his master a letter of marque, to warrant him
against charges of piracy and freebooting while prosecuting open
war against the Portuguese for their violation of the law of
nations, and in the course of a few months inflicted great loss
on them. Portuguese envoys went to the English king and told him
that this Andrew was a man of such courage and enterprise as
would make him a dangerous enemy in the war then impending with
the French, and that he could now be conveniently cut off, under
cover of piracy, to the advantage of English subjects and the
gratification of a friendly sovereign. Henry was easily
persuaded, and dispatched his admiral, Thomas Howard,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d167_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> with
two of the strongest ships of the royal navy, to lie in wait at
the Downs for Andrew, then on his way home from Flanders. They
soon had sight of the Scot, in a small vessel, with a still
smaller in company. Howard attacked Andrew's ship, but, though
the superior in all respects, was barely able to take it after
the master and most of his men had been killed. The Scots
captain, though several times wounded and with one leg broken by
a cannon-ball, seized a drum and beat a charge to inspirit his
men to fight until breath and life failed. The smaller ship was
surrendered with less resistance, and the survivors of both
vessels, by begging their lives of the king (as they were
instructed to do by the English), obtained a discharge without
punishment. The Scottish king made formal complaint of this
breach of peace, but the answer was ready: the killing of pirates
broke no leagues and furnished no decent ground for war. (Rer.
Scot. Historia, 1582, fol. 149 b, 150.)</p>

<p>Bishop Lesley, writing at about the same time as Buchanan,
openly accuses the English of fraud. "In the month of June," he
says, "Andrew Barton, being on the sea in warfare contrar the
Portingals, against whom he had a letter of mark, Sir Edmund
Howard, Lord Admiral of England, and Lord Thomas Howard, son and
heir to the Earl of Surrey, past forth at the king of England's
command, with certain of his best ships; and the said Andrew,
being in his voyage sailing toward Scotland, having only but one
ship and a bark, they set upon at the Downs, and at the first
entry did make sign unto them that there was friendship standing
betwix the two realms, and therefore thought them to be friends;
wherewith they, nothing moved, did cruelly invade, and he
manfully and courageously defended, where there was many slain,
and Andrew himself sore wounded, that he died shortly; and his
ship, called The Lion, and the bark, called Jenny Pirrvyne,
which, with the Scots men that was living, were had to London,
and kept there as prisoners in the Bishop of Yorks house, and
after was sent home in Scotland. When that the knowledge hereof
came to the king, he sent incontinent a herald to the king of
England, with letters requiring dress for the slaughter of Andrew
Barton, with the ships to be rendered again; otherwise it might
be an occasion to break the league and peace contracted between
them. To the which it was answered by the king of England that
the slaughter being a pirate, as he alleged, should be no break
to the peace; yet not the less he should cause commissioners meet
upon the borders, where they should treat upon that and all other
enormities betwix the two realms."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d167_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> (History of Scotland,
Edinburgh, 1830, p. 82 f.)</p>

<p>The ballad displaces Sir Thomas and Sir Edward Howard, and
puts in their place Lord Charles Howard, who was not born till
twenty-five years after the fight. Lord Charles Howard, son of
William, a younger half-brother of Thomas and Edward, was, in his
time, like them, Lord High Admiral, and had the honor of
commanding the fleet which served against the Armada. He was
created Earl of Nottingham in 1596, and this circumstance,
adopted into <b>A</b> 78,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d167_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> puts this excellent ballad later
than one would have said, unless, as is quite possible, the name
of the English commander has been changed. There is but one ship
in the ballad, as there is but a single captain, but Henry Hunt
makes up for the other when we come to the engagement. The dates
are much deranged in <b>A</b>. The merchants make their complaint
at midsummer, the summer solstice (in May, <b>B</b> 1), and here
there is agreement with Hall and Lesley. The English ship sails
the day before midsummer-even, <b>A</b> 17; the fight occurs not
more than four days after (<b>A</b> 18, 33, 34; <b>B</b> 16, 31);
four days is a large allowance for returning, but the ship sails
into Thames mouth on the day before New Year's even, <b>A</b> 71,
72, 74.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d167_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In <b>B</b> the English do not sail till winter, and
although the interval from May is long for fitting out a ship,
inconsistency is avoided. According to Hall, the English ships
brought in their prizes August 2d.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. King Henry Eighth, having been informed by eighty
London merchants that navigation is stopped by a Scot who would
rob them were they twenty ships to his one, asks if there is
never a lord who will fetch him that traitor, and Lord Charles
Howard volunteers for the service, he to be the only man. The
king offers him six hundred fighting men, his choice of all the
realm. Howard engages two noble marksmen, Peter Simon to be the
head of a hundred gunners, and William Horsley to be the head of
a hundred bowmen, and sails, resolved to bring in Sir Andrew and
his ship, or never again come near his prince. On the third day
he falls in with a fine ship commanded by Henry Hunt, and asks
whether they have heard of Barton. Henry Hunt had been Barton's
prisoner the day before, and can give the best intelligence and
advice. Barton is a terrible fellow; his ship is brass within and
steel without; and although there is a deficiency at <b>A</b> 36,
there is enough to show that it was not less magnificent than
strong, 36<sup>2</sup>, 75<sup>2</sup>. He has a pinnace of
thirty guns, and the voluble and not too coherent Hunt makes it a
main point to sink this pinnace first. But above all, Barton
carries beams in his topcastle, and with these, if he can drop
them, his own ship is a match for twenty; $ therefore, let no man
go to his topcastle. Hunt borrows some guns from Lord Howard,
trusting to be forgiven for breaking the oath upon which he had
been released by his captor the day before, and sets a 'glass'
(lantern?) to guide Howard's ship to Barton's, which they see the
next day. Barton is lying at anchor, 45<sup>3</sup>,
46<sup>1</sup>; the English ship, feigning to be a merchantman,
passes him without striking topsails or topmast, 'stirring
neither top nor mast.' Sir Andrew has been admiral on the sea for
more than three years, and no Englishman or Portingal passes
without his leave: he orders his pinnace to bring the pedlars
back; they shall hang at his main-mast tree. The pinnace fires on
Lord Howard and brings down his foremast and fifteen of his men,
but Simon sinks the pinnace with one discharge, which, to be
sure, includes nine yards of chain besides other great shot, less
and more. Sir Andrew cuts his ropes to go for the pedlar himself.
Lord Howard throws off disguise, sounds drums and trumpets, and
spreads his ensign. Simon's son shoots and kills sixty; the
perjured Henry Hunt comes in on the other side, brings down the
foremast, and kills eighty. One wonders that Barton's guns do not
reply; in fact he never fires a shot; but then he has that
wonderful apparatus of the beams, which, whether mechanically
perfect or not, is worked well by the poet, for not many better
passages are met with in ballad poetry than that which tells of
the three gallant attempts on the main-mast tree, 52-66. Sir
Andrew had not taken the English archery into his reckoning.
Gordon, the first man to mount, is struck through the brain; so
is James Hamilton, Barton's sister's son. Sir Andrew dons his
armor of proof and goes up himself. Horsley hits him under his
arm; Barton will not loose his hold, but a second mortal wound
forces him to come down. He calls on his men to fight on: he will
lie and bleed awhile, and then rise and fight again; "fight on
for Scotland and St. Andrew, while you hear my whistle blow!"
Soon the whistle is mute, and they know that Barton is dead; the
English board; Howard strikes off Sir Andrew's head, while the
Scots stand by weeping, and throws the body over the side, with
three hundred crowns about the middle to secure it a burial. So
Jon Rimaardss0n binds three bags about his body when he jumps
into the sea, saying, He shall not die poor that will bury my
body: Danske Viser, II, 225, st. 30. Lord Howard sails back to
England, and is royally welcomed. England before had but one ship
of war, and Sir Andrew's made the second, says the ballad, but
therein seems to be less than historically accurate: see
Southey's Lives of the British Admirals, 1833, II, 171, note.
Hunt, Horsley, and Simon are generously rewarded, and Howard is
made Earl of Nottingham. When King Henry sees Barton's ghastly
head, he exclaims that he would give a hundred pounds if the man
were alive as he is dead: ambiguous words, which one would prefer
not to interpret by the later version of the ballad, in which
Henry is eager himself to give the doom, <b>B</b> 58; nor need
we, for in the concluding stanza the king, in recognition of the
manful part that he hath played, both here and beyond the sea,
says that each of Barton's men shall have half a crown a day to
take them home.</p>

<p>The variations of <b>B</b>, as to the story, are of slight
importance. There is no pinnace in <b>B</b>. Horsley's shots are
somewhat better arranged: Gordon is shot under the collar-bone,
the nephew through the heart; the first arrow rebounds from
Barton's armor, the second smites him to the heart. 'Until you
hear my whistle blow,' in 53<sup>4</sup>, is a misconception,
coming from not understanding that till (as in <b>A</b>
66<sup>4</sup>) may mean while.</p>
