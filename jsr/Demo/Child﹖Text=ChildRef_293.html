<p><b>A</b> is found, with the doubtless accidental variation of
three words, in a folio volume at Abbotsford labelled
Miscellanies, article 43, having been transcribed by C.K. Sharpe
for Sir W. Scott "from a 4to Manuscript, in a female hand,
written probably about one hundred years ago, sold at one
Inglis's roup at the West Port, Edinburgh, now in the possession
of David Laing" (that is, Elizabeth Cochrane's Manuscript).
<b>D</b> <b>b</b> was compounded from <b>D</b> <b>a</b> and
<b>B</b>, "omitting," says Chambers, "many of the coarser stanzas
of both, and improving a few by collation with a third version
which I took down from recitation, and another which has been
shown to me in manuscript by Mr. Kinloch" (<b>C</b>). <b>D</b>
<b>b</b> is, after all, mainly <b>D</b> <b>a</b> with omissions;
the improvements from the recited copy (or the variations from
Buchan and Kinloch) are not remarkable in amount or quality.
<b>B</b> is given on Kinloch's authority. Alexander Campbell,
when on a tour on the borders of Scotland to collect Scottish
airs, is said to have received the first stanza from Mr. Thomas
Pringle, who derived it from his mother's singing. (Chappell,
Popular Music, p. 575.) Upon this traditional stanza was built
Scott's 'Jock of Hazeldean,' first printed in Campbell's Albyn's
Anthology, I, 18, 1816. <b>A</b>. A gentleman overhears a damsel
making a moan for Sir John of Hazelgreen. After some compliment
on his part, and some slight information on hers, he tells her
that Hazelgreen is married; then there is nothing for her to do,
she says, but to hold her peace and die for him. The gentleman
proposes that she shall let Hazelgreen go, marry his eldest son,
and be made a gay lady; she is too mean a maid for that, and,
anyway, had rather die for the object of her affection. Still she
allows the gentleman to take her up behind him on his horse, and
to buy clothes for her at Biggar, though all the time dropping
tears for Hazelgreen. After the shopping they mount again, and at
last they come to the gentleman's place, when the son runs out to
welcome his father. The son is young Hazelgreen, who takes the
maid in his arms and kisses off the still-falling tears. The
father declares that the two shall be married the next day, and
the young man have the family lands.</p>

<p>The other versions have the same story, but the clothes are
bought at Edinburgh, and the Hazelgreen estate seems to be in the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>In a preface to <b>C</b>, Kinloch, following either <b>D</b> 5
or some foolish popular gloss, remarks that the lady is presumed
to have seen young Hazelgreen only in a dream, which left so deep
an impression on her mind as to cause her to fall in love with
his image. To improve upon this, <b>D</b> 15 makes the young man
also to have seen the maid in a dream.</p>
