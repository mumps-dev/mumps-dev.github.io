<h3>76. The Lass of Roch Royal</h3>


<p>II, 213. There is a version of this ballad in the Roxburghe
collection, III, 488, a folio slip without imprint, dated in the
Museum Catalogue 1740. I was not aware of the existence of this
copy till it was printed by Mr. Ebsworth in the Roxburghe
Ballads, VI, 609. He puts the date of issue circa 1765. It is
here given from the original. Compare <b>H</b>.</p>

<p>Mr. W.H. Babcock has printed a little ballad as sung in
Virginia, in which are two stanzas that belong to "The Lass of
Roch Royal:' The Folk-Lore Journal, VII, 31.</p>

And your heart is no more mine.'</td></tr>

And it never was any such a thing;<br/>

The garden of the vine,<br/>
Mourning for her own true love<br/>
Just like I 've mourned for mine.'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>

To hear what my true love had to say,<br/>
So that I might know a little of his mind<br/>
Before he went away.</td></tr>

My arms across his breast;<br/>

The sun rose in the west.</td></tr>

<p>Mr. James Mooney, of the Bureau of Ethnology, 
obtained two very similar stanzas in the 'Carolina 
Mountains.'</p>
