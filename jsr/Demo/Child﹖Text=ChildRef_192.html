<p>The Stationers' Registers, 22 July, 1564 &ndash; 22 July,
1565, Arber, I, 260, have an entry of a fee from Owyn Rogers for
license to print "a ballett intituled The Blende Harper, etc.";
and again, the following year, Arber, I, 294, of a fee from Lucas
Haryson for license to print "a ballet intituled The Blynde
Harpers, with the Answere." Nothing further is known of this
ballet.</p>

<p>Boyd, the translator of Dante, had a recollection of a ballad
of a Scotch minstrel who stole a horse from one of the Henries of
England: Ritson, Scotish Song, I, xxxvi, note 25, 1794.</p>

<p>Printed in Scott's Minstrelsy, 1802 (<b>A</b> <b>c</b>), and
the next year in the Musical Museum (<b>A</b> <b>b</b>), as
communicated by Burns. Burns's copy differs very slightly from
<b>A</b> <b>a</b>, however he came by it. Scott had access to the
Glenriddell collection, and his ballad (of which he gives no
account) was made by changing <b>A</b> <b>a</b> to his taste,
substituting one stanza of his own in place of 18, and the last
two of <b>B</b>, with alterations, for the last of <b>A</b>
<b>a</b>. To reduce improbabilities, Scott put the Lord Warden
for King Henry.</p>

<p><b>C</b> was pointed out to me, and transcribed from the
short-lived periodical in which it was printed, by Mr. James
Barclay Murdoch, to whom I have been from the beginning in debted
for the most essential help.</p>

<p>Of <b>D</b> Mr. Macmath writes: This version was copied by me
in facsimile from the original manuscript in the handwriting of
the late Rev. George Murray, of Troquhain, minister of
Balmaclellan, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, and was in
possession of his son, the Rev. George Murray, to whose kindness
I was indebted for the loan of it. The late Mr. Murray took down
the ballad from the singing of Sarah Rae, a poor weak-minded
woman of his parish. Sarah Rae was the last person known to Mr.
Murray and he was a keen observer of such matters to use the
distaff. The present Mr. George Murray wrote to me on 12th
January, 1883: "I may add that I have heard her sing the ballad
myself, to a very simple but particularly plaintive lilt more
like a rapid chant than an ordinary song which rings in my ear
yet, although I only heard it once, when a lad."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d192_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>A</b>-<b>C</b>. A harper of Lochmaben (blind, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>) who means to steal the Wanton Brown, a horse of King
Henry's, consults with his wife before setting about the
business, and gets a few valuable hints; among them, to leave his
mare's foal at home. He goes up to England, and has the good
luck, so common in ballads, of finding King Henry at his gate.
The king wants to hear some of his harping, and, as the harper
makes a difficulty about the stabling of his mare, orders the
beast to be put into his own stable. The harper harps all his
hearers asleep; then makes his way softly to the stable, slips a
halter over the Wanton's nose and ties him to the mare's tail,
and turns the mare out. She goes straight to Lochmaben, to her
foal, neighs at the harper's house, and is let in by the
servant-lass, who exclaims at the braw foal that the mare has
got. In the morning they find in England that both the Wanton
Brown and the mare have been stolen. The harper breaks out into
'allaces:' he has lost a foal in Scotland and had his mare stolen
in England! The king quiets him with a promise of a better mare
and pay for his foal to boot.</p>

<p>In <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, the harper steals the horse on a wager,
which, however, is passed over lightly in <b>D</b>. The wager in
<b>B</b> is with two knights of Stirling, five ploughs of land
with one and five thousand pounds with the other, and "John" has
to go all the way to London to win it. The knights pay their loss
and then restore the Wanton Brown to Henry! so great an
improvement upon the dealings of the Scots with English
horseflesh as to compel one to assign this particular version of
the story to the nineteenth, if not the twentieth,
century.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d192_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The twelve armed men in armor bright that guard the stable
night and day in <b>E</b> 23 remind us of popular tales; as of the
Grimms' 'Master Thief.'</p>

<p><b>A</b> <b>b</b> is loosely translated by Knortz, Schottische
Balladen, No 16, p. 58.</p>
