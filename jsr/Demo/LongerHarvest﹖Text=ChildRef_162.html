<p><b>A</b> was first printed by Hearne in Guilielmi Neubrigensis
Historia, I, lxxxii ff, 1719; then by Percy, Reliques, I, 1,
1765, with a judicious preface. The whole manuscript, in which
this piece is No 8, was edited by Thomas Wright for the Roxburghe
Club in 1860: Songs and Ballads, with other short Poems, chiefly
of the Reign of Philip and Mary.</p>

<p><b>B</b> may probably be found in any of the larger sets of
broadsides. It is included in such collections as Dryden's
Miscellanies, II, 238, 1702; Pills to purge Melancholy, IV, 289,
1719; Old Ballads, I, 111, 1723; Percy's Reliques, I, 235, 1765.
<b>b</b> has many readings of <b>a</b>, the copy in the Percy
Manuscript There is a second Bagford copy, II, No 37, printed
like <b>e</b>, for W. Onley. <b>f</b>, the Scottish copy, is
probably of a date near 1700. Like the edition printed at
Glasgow, 1747, it is, in the language of Percy, "remarkable for
the wilful corruptions made in all the passages which concern the
two nations": Folio Manuscript, Hales and Furnivall, II, 1, note,
and Reliques, 1765, I, 234. The Scots are made fifteen hundred,
the English twenty, in 6, 13, 53, 54; the speeches of King James
and King Henry are interchanged in 58, 60; 62, 63, are
dropped.</p>

<p>The 'Hunttis of Chevet' is among the "sangis of natural music
of the antiquite" mentioned as sung by the "shepherds" in The
Complaynt of Scotland, a book assigned to 1549. It was an old and
a popular song at the middle of the sixteenth century. The copy
in the Ashmolean manuscript is subscribed Expliceth, quod Rychard
Sheale, upon which ground Sheale has been held to be the
author,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d162_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and not as Percy and Ritson assumed, simply the
transcriber, of the ballad. Sheale describes himself as a
minstrel living at Tarnworth, whose business was to sing and
talk, or to chant ballads and tell stories. He was the author of
four pieces of verse in the same manuscript, one of which is of
the date 1559 (No 56). This and another piece (No 46), in which
he tells how he was robbed of above three score pound, give a
sufficient idea of his dialect and style and a measure of his
ability. This ballad was of course part of his stock as minstrel;
the supposition that he was the author is preposterous in the
extreme.</p>

<p>The song "which is commonly sung of the Hunting of Chiviot,"
says Hume of Godscroft, "seemeth indeed poeticall and a meer
fiction, perhaps to stirre up vertue; yet a fiction whereof there
is no mention, neither in the Scottish nor English chronicle": p.
104. To this the general replication may be made that the ballad
can scarcely be a deliberate fiction. The singer is not a
critical historian, but he supposes himself to be dealing with
facts; he may be partial to his countrymen, but he has no doubt
that he is treating of a real event; and the singer in this
particular case thought he was describing the battle of
Otterburn, the Hunting of the Cheviot being indifferently so
called: st. 65. The agreement to meet, in <b>A</b>, st. 9,
corresponds with the plight in Otterburn, st. 16; 17<sup>4</sup>
corresponds to Otterburn 12<sup>4</sup>, 30<sup>4</sup>; 47, 56,
57, are the same as Otterburn 58, 61, 67; 31, 32, 66, are
variants of Otterburn 51, 52, 68; Douglas's summons to Percy to
yield, Percy's refusal, and Douglas's death, 33<sup>1</sup>, 35
37<sup>2</sup>, may be a variation of Otterburn 51<sup>3</sup>,
55-56; Sir John of Agarstone is slain with Percy in 52, and with
Douglas in Otterburn 60; Sir Hugh Montgomery appears in both.</p>

<p>The differences in the story of the two ballads, though not
trivial, are still not so material as to forbid us to hold that
both may be founded upon the same occurrence, the Hunting of the
Cheviot being of course the later version,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d162_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and following in
part its own tradition, though repeating some portions of the
older ballad. According to this older ballad, Douglas invades
Northumberland in an act of public war; according to the later,
Percy takes the initiative, by hunting in the Scottish hills
without the leave and in open defiance of Douglas, lieutenant of
the Marches. Such trespasses,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d162_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> whether by the English or the
Scots, were not less common, we may believe, than hostile
incursions, and the one would as naturally as the other account
for a bloody collision between the rival families of Percy and
Douglas, to those who consulted "old men" instead of histories:
cf. stanza 67. The older and the later ballad concur (and herein
are in harmony with some chroniclers, though not with the best)
as to Percy's slaying Douglas. In the older ballad Percy is taken
prisoner, an incident which history must record, but which is
somewhat insipid, for which reason we might expect tradition to
improve the tale by assigning a like fate to both of the heroic
antagonists.</p>

<p>The singer all but startles us with his historical lore when
he informs us in 63 that King Harry the Fourth "did the battle of
Hornbylldown" to requite the death of Percy; for though the
occasion of Homildon was really another incursion on the part of
the Scots, and the same Percy was in command of the English who
in the ballad meets his death at Otterburn, nevertheless the
battle of Homildon was actually done fourteen years subsequent to
that of Otterburn and falls in the reign of Henry Fourth. The
free play of fancy in assigning the cause of Homildon must be
allowed to offset the servility to an accurate chronology; and
such an extenuation is required only in this instance.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d162_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Not
only is the fourth Harry on the throne of England at the epoch of
Otterburn, but Jamy is the Scottish king, although King James I
was not crowned until 1424, the second year of Henry VI.</p>

<p>But here we may remember what is well said by Bishop Percy: "A
succession of two or three Jameses, and the long detention of one
of them, in England, would render the name familiar to the
English, and dispose a poet in those rude times to give it to any
Scottish king he happened to mention." The only important
inference from the mention of a, King James is that the
minstrel's date is not earlier than 1424.</p>

<p>The first, second, and fourth James were contemporary with a
Henry during the whole of their reign, and the third during a
part of his; with the others we need not concern ourselves. It
has given satisfaction to some who wish to reconcile the data of
the ballad with history to find in a Scottish historiographer a
record of a fight between a Percy and a Douglas in 1435 or 1436,
at the very end of the reign of James I. Henry Percy of
Northumberland, says Hector Boece, made a raid into Scotland with
four thousand men (it is not known whether of his own motion or
by royal authority), and was encountered by nearly an equal force
under William Douglas, Earl of Angus, and others, at Piperden,
the victory falling to the Scots, with about the same slaughter
on both sides: Scotorum Historia, 1526, fol. ccclxvi, back. This
affair is mentioned by Bower, Scotichronicon, 1759, II, 500 f,
but the leader of the English is not named,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d162_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> wherefore we may
doubt whether it was a Percy. Very differently from Otterburn,
this battle made but a slight impression on the chroniclers.</p>

<p>Sidney's words, though perhaps a hundred times requoted since
they were cited by Addison, cannot be omitted here: "Certainly I
must confesse my own barbarousnes. I never heard the olde song of
Percy and Duglas that I found not my heart mooved more then with
a trumpet; and yet is it sung but by some blinde crouder, with no
rougher voyce then rude stile: which, being so evill apparrelled
in the dust and cobwebbes of that uncivill age, what would it
worke trymmed in the gorgeous eloquence of Pindar!"<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d162_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Sidney's
commendation is fully justified by the quality of The Battle of
Otterburn, but is merited in even a higher degree by The Hunting
of the Cheviot, and for that reason (I know of no other) The
Hunting of the Cheviot may be supposed to be the ballad he had in
mind. The song of Percy and Douglas, then, was sung about the
country by blind fiddlers about 1580 in a rude and ancient form,
much older than the one that has come down to us; for that, if
heard by Sidney, could not have seemed to him a song of an
uncivil age, meaning the age of Percy and Douglas, two hundred
years before his day. It would give no such impression even now,
if chanted to an audience three hundred years later than
Sidney.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d162_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>B</b> is a striking but by no means a solitary example of
the impairment which an old ballad would suffer when written over
for the broadside press. This very seriously enfeebled edition
was in circulation throughout the seventeenth century, and much
sung (says Chappell) despite its length.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d162_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It is declared by
Addison, in his appreciative and tasteful critique, Spectator,
Nos 70, 74, 1711, to be the favorite ballad of the common people
of England.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d162_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Addison, who knew no other version, informs us
that Ben Jonson used to say that he had rather have been the
author of Chevy Chase than of all his works. The broadside copy
may possibly have been the only one known to Jonson also, but in
all probability the traditional ballad was still sung in the
streets in Jonson's youth, if not later.</p>

<p><b>A</b> 3. By these "shyars thre" is probably meant three
districts in Northumberland which still go by the name of
<i>shires</i> and are all in the neighborhood of Cheviot. These
are Islandshire, being the district so named from Holy Island;
Norehamshire, so called from the town and castle of Noreham or
Norham; and Bamboroughshire, the ward or hundred belonging to
Bamborough castle and town. Percy's Reliques, 1794, I, 5,
note.</p>

<p>15. Chyviat Chays, well remarks Mr. Wheatley in his edition of
the Reliques, I, 22, becomes Chevy Chace by the same process as
that by which Teviotdale becomes Tividale, and there is no
sufficient occasion for the suggestion that Chevy Chase is a
corruption of chevauchee, raid, made by Dr. E.B. Nicholson, Notes
and Queries, Third Series, XII, 124, and adopted by Burton,
History of Scotland, II, 366.</p>

<p>38 f. "That beautiful line <i>taking the dead man by the
hand</i> will put the reader in mind of &AElig;neas's behavior
towards Lausus, whom he himself had slain as he came to the
rescue of his aged father" (Ingemuit miserans graviter,
dextramque tetendit, etc., &AElig;n. X, 823, etc.): Addison, in
Spectator, No 70.</p>

<p>54<sup>3,4</sup>, and <b>B</b> 50<sup>3,4</sup>.
Witherington's prowess was not without precedent, and, better
still, was emulated in later days. Witness the battle of Ancrum
Muir, 1545, or "Lilliard's Edge," as it is commonly called, from
a woman that fought with great bravery there, to whose memory
there was a monument erected on the field of battle with this
inscription, as the traditional report goes:</p>

<p>The giant Burlong also fought wonderfully on his stumps after
Sir Triamour had smitten his legs off by the knee: Utterson's
Popular Poetry, I, 67, 1492-94, cited by Motherwell; Percy

cut off, bears two knights from their steeds "with his heved and
with his cors": 2291-2312, Weber, I, 98 f. Still better, King
Starka&eth;r, in the older Edda, fights after his head is off:
Helgakvi&eth;a Hundingsbana, ii, 27, Bugge, p. 196.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d162_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"Sed, etiam si ceciderit, de genu pugnat," Seneca, De
Providentia 2, 4 (cited in The Gentleman's Magazine, 1794, I,
306), is explained by Seneca himself, Epis. lxvi, 47: "qui,
succisis poplitibus, in genua se excepit nee arma dimisit." "In
certaminibus gladiatorum hoc s&aelig;pe accidisse et statuse
existentes docent, imprimis gladiator Borghesinus." Senec&aelig;
Op. Phil., Bouillet, II, 12.</p>

<p>61<sup>1</sup>. "Lovely London," as Maginn remarks,
Blackwood's Magazine, VII, 327, is like the Homeric &#913;
&#8016;&#947;&#949;&#8048;&#962;

591, etc. Leeve, or lovely, London, is of frequent occurrence:
see No 158, 1<sup>1</sup>, No 168, appendix, 7<sup>5</sup>, No
174, 35<sup>1</sup>, etc. So "men of pleasant Tivydale," <b>B</b>
14<sup>1</sup>, wrongly in <b>B</b> <b>a</b>, <b>f</b>, "pleasant
men of Tiuydale."</p>

<p>64<sup>3</sup>. Glendale is one of the six wards of
Northumberland, and Homildon is in this ward, a mile northwest of
Wooler.</p>

<p>65<sup>2</sup>. That tear begane this spurn "is said to be a
proverb, meaning that tear, or pull, brought about this kick":
Skeat. Such a proverb is unlikely and should be vouched. There
may be corruption, and perhaps we should read, as a lamentation,
That ear (ever) begane this spurn! Or possibly, That tear is for
That there, meaning simply there.</p>

<p>For genealogical illustrations may be consulted, with caution,
Percy's Reliques, 1794, I, 34 ff, 282 ff. With respect to 53 1,
Professor Skeat notes: "Loumle, Lumley; always hitherto printed
louele (and explained Lovel), though the Manuscript cannot be so
read, the word being written loule. 'My Lord Lumley' is mentioned
in the ballad of Scotish Feilde, Percy Fol. Manuscript, I, 226,
1. 270; and again in the ballad of Bosworth Feilde, <i>id.</i>,
III, 245, 1. 250."</p>
