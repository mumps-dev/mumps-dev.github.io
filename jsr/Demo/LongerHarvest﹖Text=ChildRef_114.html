<p>The first notice in print of this precious specimen of the
unspoiled traditional ballad is in Ritson's Scotish Song, 1794,
I, xxxvi, note 25: the Rev. Mr. Boyd, the translator of Dante,
had a faint recollection of three ballads, one of which was
called 'Johny Cox.' Before this, 1780, a lady of Carlisle had
sent a copy to Doctor Percy, <b>A</b>. Scott, 1802, was the first
to publish the ballad, selecting "the stanzas of greatest merit"
from several copies which were in his hands. John Fry gave two
valuable fragments, <b>C</b>, <b>B</b> (which he did not
separate), in his Pieces of Ancient Poetry, 1814, from a
manuscript "appearing to be the text-book of some illiterate
drummer."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d114_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> I have been able to add only three versions to
those which were already before the world, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>G</b>; and of these <b>D</b> is in part the same as <b>B</b>,
previously printed by Kinloch.</p>

<p>Pinkerton, Select Scotish Ballads, II, xxxix, 
1783, has preserved a stanza, which he assigns 
to a supposititious ballad of 'Bertram the 
Archer:'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d114_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'My trusty bow of the tough yew,<br/>
That I in London bought,<br/>
And silken strings, if ye prove true,<br/>
That my true-love has wrought.'</td></tr>

</table>

<p>This stanza agrees with <b>J</b> 6, and with <b>A</b> 18,
<b>H</b> 19 in part, and is very likely to belong here; but it
might be a movable passage, or commonplace.</p>

<p>All the versions are in accord as to the primary points of the
story. A gallant young fellow, who pays no regard to the
game-laws, goes out, despite his mother's entreaties, to ding the
dun deer down. He kills a deer, and feasts himself and his dogs
so freely on it that they all fall asleep. An old palmer, a silly
auld, stane-auld carl, observes him, and carries word to seven
foresters [fifteen <b>B</b>, three (?) <b>C</b>]. They beset
Johnie and wound him; he kills all but one, and leaves that one,
badly hurt, to carry tidings of the rest. Johnie sends a bird to
his mother to bid her fetch him away, <b>F</b> 19, 20, cf.
<b>B</b> 13; a bird warns his mother that Johnie tarries long,
<b>H</b> 21 (one of Buchan's parrots). The boy in <b>A</b> 20, 21
is evidently a corruption of bird. Information is given the
mother in a different way in <b>L</b>. <b>B</b>-<b>G</b> must be
adjudged to be incomplete; <b>I</b>-<b>M</b> are mere fragments.
<b>H</b> has a false and silly conclusion, 22-24, in imitation of
Robin Hood and of Adam Bell. Mrs. Harris had heard another
version besides <b>G</b> (of which she gives only one stanza,
<b>L</b>), in which "Johnie is slain and thrown owre a milk-white
steed; news is sent to Johnie's mother, who flies to her son." It
is the one forester who is not quite killed that is thrown over
his steed to carry tidings home, <b>F</b> 18, <b>G</b> 11.
<b>D</b> 19, <b>E</b> 17, and Mrs. Harris's second version are,
as to this point, evidently corrupted.</p>

<p>The hero's name is Johnny Cock, <b>B</b> 2, <b>C</b> 1; Johny
Cox, Rev. Mr. Boyd; John o Cockis (Johny Cockis?), <b>H</b> 17;
Johny o Cockley's Well, <b>A</b> 14; o Cockerslee, <b>D</b> 14;
of Cockielaw, in one of the versions used by Scott for <b>F</b>;
o Cocklesmuir, <b>E</b> 13, <b>H</b> 15. Again, Johnie Brad,
<b>G</b> 1, <b>L</b>; Johnie o Breadislee, <b>F</b> 14;
Braidislee, <b>J</b> 2.</p>

<p>The hunting-ground, or the place where Johnie is discovered,
is up in Braidhouplee, down in Bradyslee, <b>A</b> 6, high up in
Bradyslee, low down in Bradyslee, <b>A</b> 12; Braidscaur Hill,
<b>D</b> 6, Braidisbanks, <b>D</b> 12, <b>I</b> 1; Bride's
Braidmuir, <b>H</b> 2, 5; Broadspear Hill, <b>B</b> 2, 5;
Durrisdeer only in <b>F</b> 4. The seven foresters are of
Pickeram Side, <b>A</b> 3, 19; of Hislinton, <b>F</b> 9. <b>B</b>
1<sup>1</sup> reads, Fifteen foresters in the braid alow; which
seems to require emendation, perhaps simply to Braid alow,
perhaps to Braidislee.</p>

<p>With regard to the localities in <b>A</b>, Percy notes that
Pickeram Side is in Northumbria, and that there is a Cockley
Tower in Erringside, near Brady's Cragg, and a Brady's Cragg near
Chollerford Bridge. There is a Cockley, alias Cocklaw, in
Erringside, near Chollerton, in the south division of Tynedale
Ward, parish of St. John Lee. The Erring is a small stream which
enters the Tyne between Chollerton and Chollerford. Again,
Cocklaw Walls appears in the map of the Ordnance Survey, a little
to the north and east of Cockley in Erringside, and Cocklaw Walls
may represent the Cockley's Well of the ballad. (Percy notes that
Cockley's Well is said to be near Bewcastle, Cumberland.) I have
not found Brady's Cragg or Pickeram Side in the Ordnance Survey
maps, nor indeed any of the compounds of Braidy or Braid
anywhere.</p>

<p>There is a Braid a little to the south of Edinburgh, Braid
Hills and Braid Burn; and Motherwell, Minstrelsy, p. 17, says
that there is tradition for this region having been the
hunting-ground.</p>

<p>Scott's copy, <b>F</b>, lays the scene in Dumfriesshire, and
there is other tradition to the same effect.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d114_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Percy was struck with the occurrence of the wolf in <b>A</b>
17, found also in <b>B</b> 10, <b>C</b> 5. He considered, no
doubt, that the mention of the wolf was a token of the high
antiquity of the ballad. "Wolues that wyryeth men, wommen and
children" are spoken of in Piers Plowman, <b>C</b>, Passus, X, v.
226, Skeat, 1886, I, 240, and the <b>C</b> text is assigned to
about 1393. Holinshed (1577), I, 378, says that though the island
is void of wolves south of the Tweed, yet the Scots cannot boast
the like, since they have grievous wolves.</p>

mixture of <b>F</b> and others.</p>
