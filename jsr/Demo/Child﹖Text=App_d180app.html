<h3>King James and Brown</h3>

<h3>Appendix</h3>

<h3>The King of Scots and Andrew Browne</h3>

<p>A new Ballad, declaring the great treason conspired against
the young King of Scots, and how one Andrew Browne, an
Englishman, which was the king's chamberlaine, preuented the
same. To the tune of Milfield, or els to Greenesleeues.</p>

<p>This piece, which is contained in a collection of ballads and
proclamations in the library of the Society of Antiquaries,
London, is signed W. Elderton, and was "imprinted at London for
Yarathe Iames, dwelling in Newgate Market, ouer against Christes
Church." It was licensed to James, May 30, 1581: Arber II, 393.
Reprinted by Percy, Reliques, 1765, II, 204; here from the
original. There is an imperfect and incorrect copy in the Percy
Manuscript, p. 273; Hales and Furnivall, II, 265.</p>

<p>Morton was beheaded only three days after these verses were
licensed, and had been in durance for several months before at
the castle of Edinburgh. Elderton cannot be supposed to have the
last news from Scotland, and he was not a man to keep his
compositions by him nine years. The exhortation of Morton to his
confederate, Douglas, in the last stanza but one is divertingly
misplaced. The fictions of the privie banket and the selling of
the king beyond seas are of the same mint as those in the
ballad.</p>
