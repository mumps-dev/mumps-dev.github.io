<p>The "gospel-lads," otherwise self-styled the true Presbyterian
party, had in 1679, May 29 (observed both as the king's birth day
and the anniversary of the Restoration), begun their testimony
against the iniquity of the times by publishing a Declaration,
put ting out loyal bonfires, and burning all acts of Parliament
obnoxious to Covenanters, in retaliation for the burning of the
Covenant at London seventeen years before. They had intended to
do this at Glasgow, but as Claverhouse had established himself
there, the demonstration was made at Rutherglen, a little place
two miles off. On the 31st Claverhouse laid hands on three of the
rioters and an outlawed minister. The Covenanters had appointed a
great meeting, an armed conventicle, for the next day, Sunday,
June 1, at Loudon Hill, on the borders of the shires of Ayr and
Lanark. Not so many came as were expected, for Claverhouse had
been heard of, but there were at least two hundred and fifty
armed men; and these numbers were subsequently increased.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d205_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It
was resolved to rescue the prisoners taken the day before, if the
Lord should enable them, and in prosecution of this object they
moved on to Drumclog, a swampy farm two miles east of Loudon HilL
The chief of command was Robert Hamilton, and with him were as
sociated John Balfour of Kinloch, called Burly, Hackston of
Rathillet, and others. What ensued is told in a frank letter of
Claverhouse, written the night of the same Sunday.</p>

<p>The prisoners were to be conveyed to Glasgow. "I thought,"
says Claverhouse, "that we might make a little tour, to see if we
could fall upon a conventicle; which we did, little to our
advantage. For, when we came in sight of them, we found them
drawn up in battle, upon a most* advantageous ground, to which
there was no coming but through mosses and lakes. They were not
preaching, and had got away all their women and children. They
consisted of four battalions of foot, and all well armed with
fusils and pitchforks, and three squadrons of horse. We sent,
both, parties to skirmish, they of foot and we of dragoons; they
run for it, and sent down a battalion of foot against them (the
dragoons). We sent threescore of dragoons, who made them run
again shamefully. But in the end (they perceiving that we had the
better of them in skirmish), they resolved a general engagement,
and immediately advanced with their foot, the horse following.
They came through the loch, and the greatest body of all made up
against my troop. We kept our fire till they were within ten pace
of us. They received our fire and advanced to shock. The first
they gave us brought down the cornet, Mr. Crafford, and Captain
Bleith. Besides that, with a pitchfork, they made such an opening
in my sorrel horse's belly that his guts hung out half an ell,
and yet he cabled me off a mile; which so discouraged our jnen
that they sustained not the shock, but fell into disorder. Their
horse took the occasion' of this, and pursued us so hotly that we
got no time to rally. I saved the standards, but lost on the
place about eight or ten men, "besides wounded. But the dragoons
lo^t many more. They are not come easily off ^on the other side,
for I saw several of theni fall before we came to the shock. I
made the best retreat the confusion of our people would
suffer."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d205_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The cornet killed was Robert Graham, the "nephew" of
Claverhouse, of whom so much is made in "Old Mortality." There is
no evidence beyond the name to show that he was a near kinsman of
his captain. The Covenanters thought they had killed Claverhouse
himself, because of the name Graham being wrought into the
cornet's shirt, and treated the body with much brutality. In
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_206.html">Bothwell Bridge</a>,' st. 12, Claverhouse is represented as refusing
qtarter to the Covenanters in revenge for 4 his cornet's
death.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d205_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
