<p>'Clerk Saunders' was first given to the world in the
Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, II, 33, 1802, and was there
said to be "taken from Mr. Herd's Manuscript, with several
corrections from a shorter and more imperfect copy in the same
volume, and one or two conjectural emendations in the arrangement
of the stanzas." Sir Walter arranged his ballad with much good
taste, but this account of his dealing with Herd's copies is very
far from precisely accurate. <b>A</b>, the longer of these, does
not end, as here printed, with Margret's refusal to be comforted,
a rather unsufficing conclusion it must be owned. The story is
continued by annexing the ballad of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_77.html">Sweet William's Ghost</a>,' the
lack of which in <b>B</b> makes Scott call that version
imperfect. This sequel, found also in <b>F</b>, is omitted here,
and will be given in the proper place.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d069_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Jamieson's, <b>F</b>,
as well as Scott's, is a made-up copy, "the stanzas where the
seven brothers are introduced" having been "enlarged from two
fragments, which, although very defective in themselves,
furnished lines which, when incorporated with the text, seemed to
improve it." About one half of <b>G</b> is taken from Herd's
Manuscripts, with trivial alterations. The ghostly visitation at
the end blends '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_47.html">Proud Lady Margaret</a>' with '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_77.html">Sweet William's Ghost</a>,'
and this conclusion, not being worth transferring, has
been allowed to stand.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d069_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The dream in <b>E</b> 13 may be
derived from '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_74.html">Fair Margaret and Sweet William</a>.'</p>

<p>The austerities vowed in <b>D</b> 13-15, <b>E</b> 17-20, found
also in <b>A</b> 20-22, <b>G</b> 23-25, make a very satisfactory
termination to the tragedy, and supply a want that may be felt in
<b>B</b>, and in <b>A</b> as it stands here. The like are found
in, 'The Clerk's Twa Sons o Owsenford,' 'Bonny Bee Ho'm,'
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_262.html">Lord Livingston</a>,' 'The Weary Coble o Cargill,' and
'The Lowlands of
Holland.' Also in the French ballad of 'La Biche Blanche,' where
a brother, having unwittingly been the death of his sister, who
was maid by day but hind by night, vows himself to a seven years'
penance:</p>

<p>Wolf and Hofmann, Primavera, No 165, II, 192.</p>

<p><b>F</b>, Jamieson's version, connects 'Clerk Saunders' with a
Scandinavian ballad,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d069_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> which seems to be preserved in
abbreviated and sometimes perverted forms, also by other races.
Full forms of this Northern ballad are:</p>

<p><b>Icelandic</b>, '&Oacute;l&ouml;far kvae&eth;i,' eigbt
versions, <b>A</b>-<b>H</b>, &Iacute;slenzk Fornkv&aelig;&eth;i,
No 34, I, 332.</p>

<p><b>F&auml;r&ouml;e</b>, ' Fa&eth;ir og dottir,' communicated
by Hammershaimb to the Antiquarisk Tidsskrift, 1849-51, p. 88.</p>

<p><b>Norwegian</b>, 'Far aa d&oacute;tter,' Bugge, Gamle Norske
Folkeviser, p. 1]5, <b>A</b> (with two fragments, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>).</p>

<p>A father [king, Icelandic <b>A</b>-<b>H</b>] asks his daughter
if she is ready to marry. She has no such thought.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d069_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> [She
swore by God, by man, that she had never had the thought, had no
private connection, was as clear as a nun; but nobody knew what
was in her mind: F&auml;r&ouml;e.] Who, then, he asks, is the
fair knight that rode to your bower? No fair knight, but one of
her knaves. Whose was that horse I saw at your door? It was no
horse, but a hind from the fell. Who was that fair knight you
kissed at the spring? It was no knight, but her maid that she
kissed. Does her maid wear a sword at her side? It was no sword,
but a bunch of keys. Does her maid wear spurs? It was no spurs,
but gold on her shoes. Has her maid short hair? Her plaits were
coiled on her head. Does she wear short clothes, like men? Maids
hold up their coats when there is a dew. What babe was crying in
her chamber? It was no babe, but her dog. What was that cradle
standing by her bed? It was no cradle, but her little
silk-loom.</p>

<p>In the F&auml;r&ouml;e ballad the father then rides to the
wood, meets a knight, cuts him in two, hangs his foot, hand, and
bead to his saddle, and returns. Do you know this foot? he asks.
It has often found the way to her chamber. Do you know this hand?
Many a night it has lain on her arm. Do you know this head? Many
a kiss have the lips had. In the other versions these bloody
tokens are produced on the spot, with a more startling effect. The
daughter wishes a fire in her father's house, him in it, and
herself looking on. Instantly a blaze bursts forth, the king is
burnt up, and all that belongs to him. The daughter sets the fire
herself in the F&auml;r&ouml;e and the Norwegian ballad. She dies
of grief in Icelandic <b>C</b>, takes to the wood in <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d069_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> goes into a cloister in <b>D</b>, <b>G</b> (cf.
English <b>C</b>).</p>

<p>A briefer form of this same story is 'Den grymma Brodern,'
Afzelius, No 86, III, 107. In this a brother takes the place of
the father. After several questions be asks his sister if she
knows the man's hand that hangs at his saddle. She bursts out
into an exclamation of grief. 'Thore och hans Syster,' Arwidsson,
No 55, I, 358,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d069_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> has lost its proper conclusion, for we have
not come to the conclusion when the brother says that his
sister's false inventions will never give out till the sea wants
water, a comment which we also find in the F&auml;r&ouml;e ballad
(where, however, it is misplaced). This is the case, also, with
'Det hurtige Svar,' Danske Viser, No 204, IV, 228* and 362, but
in the Danish ballad a perversion towards the comic has begun,
the end being:</p>

I have answers still in store.'</td></tr>

<p>In a <b>Spanish</b> and <b>Portuguese</b> romance a woman has
received a lover in the absence of her husband. The husband
returns before he is expected, and puts questions similar to
those in the ballads already spoken of: whose horse, lance,
sword, is this? whose spurs, whose arms are these? and is answered
after the same fashion. There is considerable variety in the
conclusion; the husband kills his wife, kills the paramour, kills
both, both he and his rival lose their lives, the wife dies of
fright, or is even pardoned. Spanish: 'De Blanca-Ni&ntilde;a,'
Wolf and Hofmann, Primavera, No 136, II, 52; 'Romance del Conde
Lombardo,' the same, No 136 a, II, 53; 'La ad&uacute;ltera
castigada,' Mil&aacute;, Romancerillo, No 254, <b>A</b>-<b>M</b>,
pp 241-45; 'Lo retorn soptat,' Briz, IV, 183; Fernan Caballero,
La Gaviota, p. 82, ed. Leipzig, 1868.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d069_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>In an Illyrian ballad, husband, wife, and a young Clerk are
the parties. Three watches are set to give notice of the
husband's return, one in the field, one in the house-court, one
before the chamber. They give due warning, but the woman, like
Lady Barnard, in 'Little Musgrave,' will not heed. After some
questions and evasions the husband strikes off her head:
'Nev&eacute;rnost,' Vraz, Narodne P&eacute;sni Illirske, p. 72;
'Bestrafte Untreue,' A. Grun, Volkslieder aus Krain, p. 41.</p>

<p>Nothing could be easier than to give these questions,
prevarications, and comments a humorous turn, and this is done in
a large number of ballads: see '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_274.html">Our Goodman</a> came hame at
een.'</p>

<p>The two ballads which immediately follow have connections with
'Clerk Saunders.'</p>
