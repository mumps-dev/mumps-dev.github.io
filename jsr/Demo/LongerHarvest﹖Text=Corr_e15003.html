<h3>150. Robin Hood and Maid Marian</h3>


<p>P. 218 (and 43-46).</p>

<p>Mr. H.L.D. Ward, in his invaluable Catalogue of Romances,
etc., while treating of Fulk Fitz-Warine, has made the following
important remarks concerning the literary history of Maid Marian
(p. 506 f.).</p>

<p>"There were three Matildas who were popularly supposed to have
been persecuted by King John. The most historical of these was
Matilda de Braose. She was imprisoned, with her son and her son's
wife, in 1210, some (Matthew Paris and others) say at Windsor,
but another chronicler says at Corfe Castle (see a volume
published by the Soc. de l'Hist. de France in 1840), and they
were all starved to death. The second was Fulk's wife Mahaud, who
was the widow of Theobald Walter. The third was the daughter of
Robert Fitz-Walter. The only authority that can be quoted for the
story of the third Matilda is the Chronicle of Dunmow, of which
one copy of the 16th century remains, in the Cotton Manuscript,
Cleopatra, C. iii. (ff. 281-7), but which was probably begun by
Nicholas de Brumfeld, a canon of Dunmow in the latter part of the
13th century. It is there stated that, when Robert Fitz-Walter
fled to France in 1213, his daughter took refuge in Dunmow
Priory, where John, after a vain attempt at seduction, poisoned
her. Now all these three Matildas may be said to appear in the
two plays known as <i>The Downfall</i> and <i>The Death of Robert
Earle of Huntington</i>, by Anthony Munday and Henry Chettle,
which are first mentioned in Henslowe's Diary in February and
November, 1598. Two of them indeed appear in their own names,
Matilda de Braose (or Bruce) and Matilda Fitz-Walter; and the one
is starved at Windsor and the other is poisoned at Dunmow in the
second play. But in the first play Matilda Fitz-Walter escapes
the solicitations of John by joining her newly-married husband in
Sherwood, where they are called Robin Hood and Maid Marian. This
is clearly owing to a combination of the second and third
Matildas. It may have been effected by the course of tradition,
or it may have been the arbitrary work of a single author. But if
the romance of Fulk Fitz-Warin had been known to either Munday or
Chettle, other portions of it would almost certainly have
appeared in plays or novels or ballads. Now Munday introduces the
piece as a rehearsal, conducted by John Skelton the poet, who
himself plays Friar Tuck, with a view to performing it before
Henry VIII. And it is not at all unlikely that it was really
founded upon a May-day pageant devised by Skelton, but not
important enough to be specified in the list of his works in his
Garlande of Laurell. We know that Skelton did write Interludes,
of which one still remains, <i>Magnyfycence</i>: and Anthony Wood
tells us that at Diss in Norfolk, where Skelton was rector, he
was 'esteemed more fit for the stage than the pew or pulpit.'
Thus there was no man more likely than Skelton to devise a new
Robin Hood pageant for his old pupil, Henry VIII. And again,
there was no man more likely to celebrate the story of Matilda
Fitz-Walter, for the patron of his living was Robert Lord
Fitz-Walter, who was himself a Ratcliffe, but who had inherited
the lordship of Diss through his grandmother, the last of the old
Fitz-Walters.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_e15003_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> But whether Skelton may have read the then
accessible poem about Fulk, afterwards described by Leland, or
whether either he or Munday may have received the story in its
composite form, it is pretty evident that the two reputed objects
of King John's desire, Matilda Walter and Matilda Fitz-Walter,
have become blended together into the Maid Marian of the
play."</p>
