<i>Comment:</i> The mother was a witch; made 
responses for Margaret; met him in a green 
habit on his return home. He inquired for 
the ford; she directed him to the deepest 
linn. When he got into the water, two 
hounds seized on his horse, and left him to 
struggle with the current.<br/>

<i>Willie's mother had transferred herself to 
Margaret's house according to the variation in</i> 9<sup>4;</sup>
<i>so she is the witch.</i><br/>

<i>All this is very paltry. The mother's curse 
was enough to drown Willie without her 
bestirring herself further.</i></td></tr>
