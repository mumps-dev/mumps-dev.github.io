<h3>The Baron o Leys</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Skene Manuscript, p. 20. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d24101.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
<li>'Laird o Leys,' Kinloch's Ballad Book, p. 74. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d24102.html"><i>Version B</i></a></li>
<li>'The Baron o Leys,' Buchan's Ballads of the North 
of Scotland, II, 144. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d24103.html"><i>Version C</i></a></li>
</ol>
 
<p>'The Baron o Leys,' in The New Deeside Guide by James Brown [=
Joseph Robertson], Aberdeen [1832], p. 15, and The Deeside Guide,
Aberdeen, 1889, p. 23, is <b>C</b>. <b>C</b> 4-11 seems to be an
interpolation by a later hand.</p>

<p>"Part of this ballad," says Buchan, II, 322, "by
ballad-mongers has been confused with the ballad of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_235.html">The Earl of Aboyne</a>'
[No 240, <b>A</b> <b>b</b>], called in some instances
'The Ranting Laddie.'" Laing, Thistle of Scotland, p. 11, appears
to have confounded it with '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_235.html">The Earl of Aboyne</a>' proper. He gives
this stanza:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'Some ca me that and some ca me this,<br/>
And The Baron o Leys they ca me,<br/>
But when I am on bonny Deeside<br/>
They ca me The Rantin Laddie.'</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Herd's Manuscripts, I, 233, II, fol. 71, give the two 
following stanzas under the title 'The Linkin 
Ladie:'</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'Wae's me that eer I made your bed!<br/>
Wae's me that eer I saw ye!<br/>
For now I Ve lost my maidenhead,<br/>
And I ken na how they ca ye.'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'My name is well kent in my ain country,<br/>
They ca me The Linking Ladie;<br/>
If ye had not been as willing as I,<br/>
Shame fa them wad eer hae bade ye!'</td></tr>

</table>

<p>'The Linkin Ladie,' judging from this fragment (as it may be
supposed to be), was much of a fashion with the ballad which we
are engaged with, and may have been an earlier form of it. Sir
Walter Scott, who cites these verses from memory (Sharpe's Ballad
Book, ed. 1880, p. 162), says that the hero of them was a brother
of the celebrated [Thomas] Boston, author of 'The Fourfold
State.'</p>

<p>'The Baron o Leys' relates, or purports to relate, to an
escapade of one of the Burnetts of Leys, Kincardineshire,
Alexander, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, George, <b>C</b>. A woman who is
with child by him gives him his choice of marriage, death, or the
payment of ten thousand crowns. He is a married man; his wife is
ready to sell everything, to her silk gowns, to release her
husband from his awkward position.</p>
