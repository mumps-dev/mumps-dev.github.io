<h3>30. King Arthur and King Cornwall</h3>

<p>The mutilation of the early pages of the Percy manuscript
leaves us in possession of only one half of this ballad, and that
half in eight fragments, so that even the outline of the story
cannot be fully made out. Apparently it should run as follows:
King Arthur, while boasting to Gawain of his Round Table, is told
by Guenever that she knows of one immeasurably finer, and the
palace it stands in is worth all Little Britain besides, but not
a word will she say as to where this table and this goodly
building may be. Arthur makes a vow never to sleep two nights in
one place till he sees that round table; and, taking for
companions Gawain, Tristram, Sir Bredbeddle, and Sir Marramiles,
sets out on the quest. The five assume a palmer's weed simply for
disguise, and travel east and west, only to arrive at Cornwall,
so very little a way from home. The proud porter of Cornwall's
gate, clad in a suit of gold, for his master is the richest king
in Christendom, or yet in heathenesse, is evidently impressed
with Arthur's bearing. Cornwall, finding that the pilgrims come
from Little Britain, asks if they ever knew King Arthur, and
boasts that he had lived seven years in Arthur's kingdom, and had
had a daughter by Arthur's wife, now a lady of radiant beauty. He
then sends for his wonderful steed and probably his horn and
sword (which also have remarkable properties), and a
Burlow-Beanie, or BillyBlin, a seven-headed, fire-breathing
fiend, whom he has in his service. Arthur is then conducted to
bed, and the Billy-Blin, shut up, as far as we can make out, in
some sort of barrel or other vessel (called a thrub chadler, or
trub chandler), is set by Arthur's bedside to hear and report the
talk of the pilgrims. Now it would seem that the knights make
each their vow or brag. Arthur's is that he will be the death of
Cornwall King before he sees Little Britain. Gawain will have
Cornwall's daughter home with him. Here there is a gap. Tristram
should undertake to blow the horn, Marramiles to ride the steed,
and Arthur to kill Cornwall with the sword. But first it would be
necessary to subdue the loathly fiend. Bredbeddle bursts open the
"rub-chadler," and fights the monster in a style that is a joy to
see; but sword, knife, and axe all break, and he is left without
a weapon. Yet he had something better to fall back on, and that
was a little book which he had found by the seaside. It was
probably a book of Evangiles; our Lord had written it with his
hands and sealed it with his blood. With this little book
Bredbeddle conjures the Burlow-Beanie, and shuts him up till
wanted in a "wall of stone." He then reports to Arthur, who has a
great desire to see the fiend in all his terrors, and makes the
fiend start out again. The Billy-Blin is now entirely amenable to
command. Bredbeddle has only to conjure him to do a thing, and it
is done. First he fetches down the steed. Marramiles considers
that he is the man to ride him, but finds he can do nothing with
him, and has to call on Bredbeddle for help. The Billy-Blin is
required to tell how the steed is to be ridden, and reveals that
three strokes of a gold wand which stands in Cornwall's
study-window will make him spring like spark from brand. And so
it comes out that Cornwall is a magician. Next the horn has to be
fetched, but, when brought, it cannot be sounded. For this a
certain powder is required. This the fiend procures. Tristram
blows a blast which rends the horn up to the midst. Finally, the
Billy-Blin is conjured to fetch the sword, and with this sword
Arthur goes and strikes off Cornwall's head. So Arthur keeps his
vow, and so far as we can see all the rest are in a condition to
keep theirs.</p>

<p>The ballad bears a close relation to the eleventh-century
chanson de geste of Charlemagne's Journey to Jerusalem and
Constantinople. Perhaps the two are derived from a common 
source.</p>
