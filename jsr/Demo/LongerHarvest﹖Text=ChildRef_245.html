<p>The copy in Christie's Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 252, is
abridged from <b>C</b>, with half a dozen arbitrary and
insignificant changes.</p>

<p>Skippers (lords) of Lothain, <b>A</b>, of Scarsburgh,
<b>C</b>, of Aberdeen, <b>D</b>, are bragging over their drink:
some, absurdly enough, of their hawks and hounds,
<b>A</b>-<b>C</b>, some of their ladies, young Allan of his ship,
which will outsail all others but three.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d245_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A boy in <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>, says that his master has a boat (it is a coal-carrier
in <b>C</b>) which will take the wind from him. A wager is laid,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. All the rest go to drinking, 'to
the tows,' but Allan to his prayers, <b>C</b> 8. They sail; there
is a terrible storm, in the course of which the, three
competitors are 'rent in nine,' <b>A</b> 9, or two of them sink,
and the topmast of the third 'gaes in nine,' <b>E</b> 7-9.</p>

<p>In <b>A</b> they have sailed only a few leagues, when Allan's
ship is so racked by the storm that they see water through her
sides. At this point, especially in <b>A</b>, Allan's seamanship
appears to very little advantage; he is more of a fair-weather
yachtsman than of a skeely skipper. If he could get a bonny boy
to take the helm and bring the ship in safe, the boy should have
a liberal share of his gold and land, and a daughter Ann besides,
whom one is surprised that Young Allan should have to offer. In
<b>A</b> and <b>D</b> the bonny boy evidently takes command of
the ship, although in <b>A</b> 18 the sailors ascribe their
safety, under God, to their good master. The ballad indeed
suffers almost as grievously as the comely cog.</p>

<p>In <b>B</b>-<b>E</b> Allan calls for a bonny boy to take the
helm while he goes to the masthead to look for land. In <b>D</b>
he makes the same promises as in <b>A</b>, but the bonny boy
cares only for Ann. In <b>B</b>, <b>C</b> the bonny boy suggests
that Allan should waken his drunken men, for whom good thick
shoes had been bought, though none had been given him. But in all
the boy takes the helm, and in fact keeps it till the ship is in.
Allan, at the masthead, can see neither day nor landmark; many
feather-beds are floating on the water, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. The
boy calls his master down; the sea can be seen through the ship's
sides, <b>B</b>-<b>E</b>.</p>

<p>Orders are given, by the boy or by Allan (by the boy certainly
in <b>D</b>, and by Allan in <b>E</b>), to take feather-beds and
canvas and lay, busk, or wrap the ship round; pitch and tar are
also recommended in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. This done, Allan
addresses the ship: Spring up, and gold shall be your hire,
<b>A</b>; Haste to dry land, and every nail that is in you shall
be a gold pin, <b>B</b>; For every iron nail in you, of gold
there shall be ten, <b>C</b>; in <b>D</b>, indirectly, Where she
wants an iron nail drive in a silver pin, and where she wants an
oaken bolt beat in the gold, and the like in <b>E</b>. When the
ship hears this, she springs from the water like sparks from the
tire, <b>A</b>-<b>C</b>.</p>

<p>The first shore they come to is Troup, <b>B</b>, Howdoloot,
<b>C</b>, Linn, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>. The ship is kept off with
cannon, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, with spears and bayonets, <b>D</b>;
is towed in (wrongly), <b>E</b>. The next shore they come to is
Lee, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, Howdilee, <b>C</b>, wanting in <b>D</b>;
'they bare her to the sea,' <b>C</b>, 'they turned their ship
about,' <b>D</b>, the ship is towed in (wrongly), <b>B</b>,
<b>E</b>. The third shore they come to is Lin, <b>B</b>,
Howdilin, <b>C</b>, Aberdeen, <b>D</b>; the ship is towed in
(welcomed), with drums beating and pipes playing, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>.</p>

<p>Allan calls for the bonny boy that brought the ship safe in,
that took the helm in hand, and offers him gold, land, and his
daughter; the boy rejects gold and land, and takes the daughter,
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>; Allan makes over to the boy his comely cog
and gives him his daughter, <b>B</b>; gives him his daughter,
<b>C</b>.</p>

<p>Five-and-forty ships, <b>A</b>, three-and-fifty, <b>C</b>,
one-and-twenty, <b>E</b>, went to sea, and only one came
back.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d245_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>This ballad is mixed with that of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_58.html">Sir Patrick Spens</a>,' No 58,
II, 21 ff. <b>E</b> 1-6 belong entirely to No 58, and <b>K</b>
6-10, <b>M</b> 1, 3, of No 58 belong to 'Young Allan.' The bonny
boy is found in 58, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>J</b>; the floating feather-beds occur in
<b>E</b>-<b>H</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>R</b>; the sea is seen
through the ship in 58, <b>C</b> 15, <b>I</b> 21; cloth is wapped
into the ship's side to keep out water, <b>H</b> 19, 20;
feather-beds and canvas (and pitch) are used as here in <b>I</b>
22, 23.</p>

<p>By far the most interesting feature in this ballad is Allan's
addressing his ship and the ship's intelligent behavior, <b>A</b>
16, 17, <b>B</b> 12-15, <b>C</b> 21-22.
Frio&eth;&thorn;j&oacute;f's ship Elli&eth;a understood and
obeyed the speech of its master: Fornaldar Sogur, II, 79, 443
(cited by Bugge). Ranild's ship came to him when he blew his
horn: 'Svend Ranild,' Grundtvig, No 28, I, 867 (translated by
Prior, I, 286). In another Danish ballad, and one of the best,
the Ox when sailed by St. Olav, responds to his commands as if
fully endowed with consciousness; he thwacks it in the side and
over the eye, and it goes faster and faster; but it is animate
only for the nonce: 'Hellig-Olavs Vasddefart,' Grundtvig, No 50,
II, 134, Prior, I, 356.</p>

<p>The Ph&aelig;acian ships have neither helmsman nor helm, and
know men's minds and the way to all cities: Odyssey, viii, 557
ff. There is a magical self-moving ship in Marie de France's
Guigemar, and elsewhere.</p>
