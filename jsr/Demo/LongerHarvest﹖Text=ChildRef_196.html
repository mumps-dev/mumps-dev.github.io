<p><b>A</b> <b>a</b> was communicated to Motherwell by Charles
Kirkpatrick Sharpe. (Corrections have here been adopted from
Motherwell's Errata: see also the Musical Museum, 1853, IV,
322*.) <b>A</b> <b>b</b>, says Motherwell, has the
"disadvantage of containing a very considerable number of slight
verbal and literal inaccuracies." The implication is, or should
be, that these variations are of editorial origin. Some of the
readings of <b>b</b> are in themselves better than those of
<b>a</b>. <b>b</b> is repeated in Buchan's Gleanings, p. 165. The
copy in Maidment's Scotish Ballads, 1868, I, 267, is a with a
reading or two from <b>b</b>, arbitrary alterations, and some
misprints.</p>

<p>Dr. Joseph Robertson has, in one of his notebooks,
"Adversaria," p. 63, the two following stanzas, given him by a
gentleman of Buchan as belonging to "The Burning of Frendraught
House."</p>

<p>'Will ye play at the cards, Lord John?<br/>
Will ye drink at the wine?<br/>
Or will ye [gang] to a weel made bed,<br/>
And sleep till it be time?'</p>

<p>'I'll no play at the cards, ladie,<br/>
I'll no drink at the wine;<br/>
But I'll gang to a weel made bed,<br/>
An sleep till it be time.'</p>

<p>Undoubtedly these stanzas may have occurred in a version of
this ballad, but they are a commonplace, and sometimes an
intrusive one. See II, 109, '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_64.html">Fair Janet</a>,' <b>F</b> 4, 5; 154,
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_68.html">Young Hunting</a>,' <b>K</b> 8, 9; 164, 'Clerk Saunders,' <b>F</b>,

<p>The modern, and extremely vapid, ballad of 'Frennet Hall'
appeared originally (I suppose) in Herd's Scottish Songs, 1776,
I, 142, and was afterwards received into Ritson's Scotish Songs,
II, 31, The Musical Museum, No 286, etc.</p>

<p>James Crichton of Frendraught and William Gordon of Rothiemay
(a neighboring estate<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d196_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>) had a fierce quarrel about
fishing-rights pertaining to lands which Gordon had sold to
Crichton. A legal decision was rendered in favor of Frendraught,
who, however, pursued his adversary with excessive vigor and
procured him to be outlawed. After this, Rothiemay would hear to
no terms of peace, and collected a party of loose fellows with
the intent to waste Frendraught's lands. Frendraught obtained a
commission to arrest Rothiemay, and on the first day of the year
1630 set out to put this in force, accompanied, among others, by
his uncle (George Gordon) James Leslie, son of the laird of
Pitcaple, and John Meldrum, who was married to young Leslie's
aunt. Rothiemay, hearing of Frendraught's coming, rode out to
meet him, and there was a fight, in which Rothiemay and George
Gordon were mortally wounded, and Meldrum badly. The feud waxed
hot, and Frendraught's lands were in danger of being burned and
ravaged by Highlanders, with whom John Gordon of Rothiemay, son
to the slain laird, had combined for the purpose. But in the end,
by the strenuous exertions of the Marquis of Huntly and others, a
settlement was effected. The laird of Rothiemay and the children
of George Gordon were "to remit their father's slaughter
mutually," and in satisfaction thereof the laird of Frendraught
was to pay a certain sum of money to young Rothiemay and to
George Gordon's children: "which both, Frendraught obeyed and
performed willingly, and so, all parties having shaken hands,
they were heartily reconciled."</p>

<p>This broil was no sooner settled than another sprouted, a
side-shoot from the same stem. Meldrum, who had been with
Frendraught in the affray with Rothiemay, and had been wounded,
was dissatisfied with such requital as he received, and, getting
nothing more by his bickering and threats, helped himself one
night to two of Frendraught's best horses! Summoned to court for
the theft, he " turned rebel " and did not appear. Frendraught
obtained a commission to arrest him, and went to look for him at
Pitcaple, a place belonging to John Leslie, Meldrum's
brother-in-law. He did not find Meldrum, but fell in with James
Leslie, Pitcaple's son, who had also been of Frendraught's party
at the encounter on New Year's day. There was talk about
Meldrum's behavior, in which Frendraught comported himself
forbearingly; but James Leslie and Robert Crichton, a kinsman of
Frendraught, had hot words, which ended in Leslie's getting a
dangerous shot in the arm. Hereupon the larger part of the
surname of Leslie rose in arms against the Crichtons.
Frendraught, grieved for what had happened to James Leslie,
betook himself to the Marquis of Huntly, and entreated him to
make peace. The marquis sent for the Leslies, and did his best to
reconcile them, but Pitcaple would listen to nothing until he
knew whether his son James was to live or die. Huntly, fearing
for Frendraught's safety, kept him two days at the Bog of Gight,
and then, hearing that the Leslies were lying in wait, sent his
own son, Viscount Melgum, and the young laird of Rothiemay, to
protect him on the way home. Arrived there, the laird and his
lady begged these young gentlemen to remain overnight, "and did
their best, with all demonstration of love and kindness, to
entertain them, think ing themselves happy now to have purchased
such friends who had formerly been their foes." At about two in
the morning the tower of Frendraught house, in which these guests
lay, took fire, and they with four of their servants were burnt
to death. This occurred on the eighth (ninth) of October.</p>

<p>So far Sir Robert Gordon, uncle of the lady of Frendraught and
cousin of the Marquis of Huntly, who was perfectly acquainted
with all the parties and circumstances. He goes on to say, with
entire fairness: "The rumor of this unhappy accident did speedily
spread itself throughout the whole kingdom, every man bewailing
it, and constructing it diversly as their affections led them;
some laying an aspersion upon Frendraught, as if he had wil fully
destroyed his guests, who had come thither to defend him against
his enemies; which carried no appearance of truth; for, besides
the improbability of the matter, he did lose therein a great
quantity of silver, both coined and uncoined, and likewise all
his writs and evidents were therein burnt."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d196_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The monstrous wickedness of this act would not, in the light
of the history of those times, afford an argument that would of
itself avail to clear Frendraught; but what words could describe
his recklessness and folly! Supposing him willing to set fire to
his own house, and sacrifice his silver and securities, for the
gratification of burning young Rothiemay with the rest, he knew
very well what consequences he had to expect. He had been glad to
compound his feud with the Rothiemays by the payment of money
(some say the considerable sum of 50,000 merks). He had been
alarmed, and with good reason, at the prospect of a feud with the
Leslies. But what were these to a feud with the Marquis of
Huntly, which would bring down upon him, and did bring down upon
him, not only the reprisals of the Gordons, but spoliation from
all the brigands of the country?<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d196_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>'Lewed people demen gladly to the badder ende,'</p>

<p>says Chaucer, and so it was with ballad-makers, and sometimes
even with clerks; John Spalding, for instance, the other
contemporary authority upon this subject, who gives a lively and
detailed account of the burning of the tower, as follows.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d196_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"The viscount was laid in a bed in the Old Tower, going off
the hall, and standing upon a vault, wherein there was a round
hole, devised of old, just under Aboyne's<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d196_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> bed. Robert
Gordon, born in Sutherland, his servitor, and English Will, his
page, was both laid beside him in the same chamber. The laird of
Rothiemay, with some servants beside him, was laid in an upper
chamber just above Aboyne's chamber; and in another room above
that chamber was laid George Chalmer of Noth, and George Gordon,
another of the viscount's servants; with whom also was laid
Captain Rollok, then in Frendraught's own company. Thus all being
at rest, about mid night that dolorous tower took fire in so
sudden and furious manner, yea, and in a clap, that this noble
viscount, the laird of Rothiemay, English Will, Colin Ivat,
another of Aboyne's servitors, and other two, being six in
number, were cruelly burnt and tormented to the death, but help
or relief; the laird of Frendraught, his lady and whole house
hold looking on, without moving or stirring to deliver them from
the fury of this fearful fire, as was reported. Robert Gordon,
called Sutherland Robert, being in the viscount's chamber,
escaped this fire with his life. George Chalmer and Captain
Rollok, being in the third room, escaped also this fire, and, as
was said, Aboyne might have saved him self also if he had gone
out of doors, which he would not do, but suddenly ran up stairs
to Rothiemay's chamber, and wakened him to rise, and as he is
wakening him, the timber passage and lofting of the chamber
hastily takes fire, so that none of them could win down stairs
again; so they turned to a window looking to the close, where
they piteously cried help, help, many times, for God's cause! the
laird and the lady, with their servants, all seeing and hearing
this woeful crying, but made no help nor manner of helping; which
they perceiving, they cried oftentimes mercy at God's hands for
their sins, syne clasped in other arms, and cheerfully suffered
this cruel martyrdom. Thus died this noble viscount, of singular
expectation, Rothiemay, a brave youth, and the rest, by this
doleful fire never enough to be deplored, to the great grief and
sorrow of their kin, friends, parents, and whole country people,
especially to the noble marquis, who for his goodwill got this
reward."</p>

<p>Spalding tells us that it was reported that, the morning after
the fire, Lady Frendraught, riding on a small nag, and with no
attendants but a boy to lead her horse, came weeping to the Bog,
desiring to speak with the marquis, but was refused. The
Huntly-Gordons, the Earl of Errol (brother of Vis countess
Melgum), and many other friends held a council, and after serious
consideration came to the conclusion that the fire "could not
come by chance, sloth, or accident, but was plotted and devised
of set purpose;" Frendraught, his lady, his friends and servants,
one or other, knowing thereof. The marquis, however, was resolved
not to revenge himself "by way of deed," but to invoke the laws.
Frendraught, as far as we can see, desired a legal inquiry no
less than Huntly. He ad dressed himself to the Lord Chancellor
and to the Privy Council, and offered to undergo any form of
trial, and, delays occurring, he re peated to the Council his
wish to have " that hidden mystery brought to a clear light."
Examinations and prosecutions, extended to the middle of the year
1634, failed to fix the guilt of the fire on him or anybody,
although John Meldrum, on the strength of some threats which he
had uttered, was wrongfully convicted of the act and was
executed.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d196_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>A</b>. The date is the eighteenth of October, new style for
the eighth. When Gordon and Rothiemay (having convoyed
Frendraught safely home) are on the point of returning, Lady
Frendraught urges them to stay, in token of good feeling between
Huntly and her husband. Lord John is quite disposed to comply,
but Rothiemay says that his horse has been tampered with since
their coming, and he fears that he is fey. After the regular
evening-mass of ballads (which would have suited Lady
Frendraught, a concealed Catholic, but not her husband), Lord
John and Rothiemay are laid in one chamber, an arrangement which
would have allowed both to escape, as Robert Gordon did, who
slept in his master's room. Lord John wakes with the smoke and
heat, and rouses Rothiemay. The doors and windows are fastened.
Rothiemay goes to the 'wire-window,' and finds the stanchions too
strong to be dealt with. He sees Lady Frendraught below, and
cries to her for mercy; her husband killed the father, and now
she is burning the son. Lady Frendraught is sorry that she must
burn Lord John in order to burn Rothiemay, but there is no help;
the keys are cast in the deep draw-well.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d196_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> [Robert] Gordon,
who has escaped though the keys were in the well, calls to his
master to jump from the window; he will catch him in his arms.
His master answers that no fire shall part him and Rothiemay, and
besides, the window is fast. He throws his finger-rings down, to
be given to his lady. When the servant goes home to his mistress,
she reproaches him for coming back alive and leaving his master
dead. She tears off the clothes which her maid puts on her,
exclaiming that she won a sore heart the day she was married, and
that that day has returned (which is not easy to understand: see
Appendix).</p>

<p><b>B</b>. This fragment represents Lady Frendraught as being
very importunate with Lord John: she presses him three times over
to stay, and promises him a morning-gift of lands if he will
comply; by a perversion of tradition, Strathbogie, which had been
in his family three hundred years, and which, further on, he
offers to give her if she will let him out. Finding that he
cannot escape (perhaps stanza 7 should come later), Lord John
takes out his psalm-book and sings three verses, with 'God end
our misery' at each verse's end. In 9 he sees his elder brother,
Lord George, from the window, and asks what news he has, but a
defect conceals from us the point of this passage. Stanza 16
seems to belong to Lord John's wife.</p>

<p><b>C</b>. When the gentlemen are in their saddles, ready to
ride away, Lady Frendraught, on her bare knees, begs them to
remain, and promises them a firlot of red gold if they will. When
everybody has gone to bed, the doors are locked and the windows
shut. The reek begins to rise and the joists to crack; Lord John
betakes himself to the window, and finds the stanchions too
strong to break. He goes back and wakens Rothiemay, and proposes
to him to praise the Lord in the fifty-third psalm,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d196_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> for
there is treason about them. He calls to Lady Frendraught,
walking on the green, for mercy; she replies that the keys are in
the well, and the doors were locked yesterday. He reproaches her
for burning her own flesh. George Chalmers (who really escaped,
though lodged in the third story) is described as leaping the
ditches and coming, from without, to Rothiemay 's help, and Colin
Irving (the Colin I vat of Spalding, who was burnt) as doing the
same in behalf of Lord John, to whom he calls to jump into his
arms. Lord John is burning, and there is little more left of him
than his spirit; but he throws down a purse of gold for the poor
and his rings for his wife. Lady Rothiemay comes in the morning
to cry vengeance on Frendraught, who has betrayed the gay
Gordons, killed her lord, and burnt her son.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d196_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>D</b>. "'There are some intermediate particulars,' Mr. Boyd
says, 'respecting the lady's lodging her victims in a turret or
flanker which did not communicate with the castle.' 'This,' adds
he, 'I only have from tradition, as I never heard any other
stanzas besides the foregoing.' The author of the original, we
may perceive, either through ignorance or design, had deviated
from the fact in supposing Lady Frennet's husband to have been
slain by Lord John's father." Ritson, p. 86.</p>

<p>It may be noted that three of the most tragical of the
Scottish historical ballads are associated with the name of
Gordon: the Earning of Towie, as we might call '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_178.html">Captain Car</a>,' No
178, through Adam Gordon, uncle of the first marquis of Huntly;
the Burning of Donibristle, known as The Bonny Earl of Murray,'
No 181, of which the responsibility is put upon the marquis (then
earl) himself; and the Burning of Frendraught, in which his son
perished.</p>
