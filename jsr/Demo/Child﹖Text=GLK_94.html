<h3>94. Young Waters</h3>

<p>'Young Waters' was first printed in 1755; Percy's
text(Reliques, 1765, II 172) agrees with this edition except in
half a dozen trivial points. Motherwell says he had never met
with any traditionary version of this ballad. Buchan, who may
generally be relied upon to produce a longer ballad than anybody
else, has 'Young Waters' in thirty-nine stanzas, "the only
complete version which he had ever met." Everything in this copy
which is not in the edition of 1755 (itself a little worse for
editing) is a counterfeit of the lowest description.</p>

<p>It is possible, and Aytonn thinks highly probable, that this
ballad may have been founded on some real event in Scottish
history; but Aytoun shows a commendable discretion in his
conclusion that, "though various conjectures have been hazarded
as to its origin, none appear sufficiently plausible to warrant
their adoption." A Scandinavian ballad (Grundtvig, No. 178),
historical to the extent that one version has historical names,
exhibits the principal incidents of the short story of 'Young
Waters.'</p>
