<h3>Introduction by George Lyman Kittredge</h3>

<p><i>This introduction is not actually part of F.J. Childs work, 
but appears in an abridged edition published in 1904, edited by
Bliss Perry, Helen Child Sargent and George Lyman Kittredge.<br/>
Ed found it worth-while to include this introduction 
here.</i></p>

<p>A ballad is a song that tells a story, or &mdash; to take the
other point of view &mdash; a story told in song. More formally,
it may be defined as a short narrative poem, adapted for singing,
simple in plot and metrical structure, divided into stanzas, and
characterized by complete impersonality so far as the author or
singer is concerned. This last trait is of the very first
consequence in determining the quality or qualities which give
the ballad its peculiar place in literature. A ballad has no
author. At all events, it appears to have none. The teller of the
story for the time being is as much the author as the unknown
(and for our purposes unimportant) person who first put it into
shape. In most forms of artistic literature the personality of
the writer is a matter of deep concern to the reader. The style,
we say, is the man. The individuality of one poet distinguishes
his works, however they may vary among themselves, from the works
of all other poets. Chaucer, for instance, has his way, or his
ways, of telling a tale that are not the way, or the ways, of
William Morris. If a would-be creative literary artist has no
individuality that we can detect, we set him down as
conventional, and that is an end of him aud of his works. In the
ballad it is not so. There the author is of no account. He is not
even present. We do not feel sure that he ever existed. At most,
we merely infer his existence, at some indefinite time in the
past, from the fact of his product: a poem, we think, implies a
poet; therefore somebody must have composed this ballad. Until
we begin to reason, we have no thought of the author of any
ballad, because, so far as we can see, he had no thought of
himself.</p>

<p>We may go a step farther in this matter of impersonality. Not
only is the author of a ballad invisible, and, so far as the
effect which the poem produces on the hearer is concerned,
practically non-existent, but the teller of the tale has no role
in it. Unlike other songs, it does not purport to give utterance
to the feelings or the mood of the singer.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The first person
does not occur at all, except in the speeches of the several
characters. Finally, there are no comments or reflections by the
narrator. He does not dissect or psychologize. He does not take
sides for or against any of the dramatis personae. He merely
tells what happened and what people said, and he confines the
dialogue to its simplest and most inevitable elements. The story
exists for its own sake. If it were possible to conceive a tale
as telling itself, without the instrumentality of a conscious
speaker, the ballad would be such a tale.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>So far we have dealt in generalities and impressions. What has
been said is obvious enough, and it is admitted by everybody.
There is, as we shall see presently, no agreement among scholars
as to the origin and history of what are called popular ballads,
but as to the fact of their impersonal quality there is no
dispute. Nor will it be denied that this quality puts them in a
class by themselves. Whatever the cause or causes, the bare fact
is clear and undeniable. No one can read 'The Hunting of the
Cheviot,' or 'Mary Hamilton,' or 'Johnie Armstrong' or 'Robyn and
Gandeleyn,' or 'The Wife of Usher's Well,' and fail to recognize
that, different as they are from each other in theme and in
effect, they belong together. Yet no two of them are the works of
the same author. Their common element is not the personality of
the writer but his impersonality; and this distinguishes the
ballad, as a class, from the productions of the conscious
literary artist. In studying ballads, then, we are studying the
"poetry of the folk," and the "poetry of the folk" is different
from the "poetry of art."</p>

<p>Poetry of the folk is, perhaps, a dangerous phrase; but it is
too convenient to be lightly rejected, and, if we proceed with
caution, we may employ it without disaster. Let us hasten to
acknowledge that in introducing the term at this stage of our
discussion we have gone somewhat farther than the logic of the
situation warrants. We have seen, to be sure, that all poetry is
divisible into two great classes, &mdash; that which is
manifestly the work of the conscious artist, and that which is
not. We have recognized a characteristic difference between 'The
Prioress's Tale' and 'Julian and Maddalo' on the one hand, and
'Johnie Armstrong' and 'The Wife of Usher's Well' on the other.
But we have not yet discovered anything that justifies us in
calling the ballads /oM>poetry, and we have not denned the folk,
though that is a term which assuredly requires explanation.</p>

<p>The alphabet was no doubt a great invention, and everybody
should be happy to know that he can write. But now and then it
would be convenient if one's thoughts could dissociate literature
for a moment from the written or printed page. In theory this is
easy enough to do. Practically, however, it is difficult for even
a professed student of linguistics to remember that a word is
properly a sign made with the vocal organs, and that the written
word is merely a conventional symbol standing for the word that
is spoken. We are in the habit of thinking that a word should be
pronounced as it is spelled, rather than that it should be
spelled as it is pronounced. Author means to us a man with a pen
in his hand, &mdash; a writer, as we call him. It requires a
combined effort of the reason and the imagination to conceive a
poet as a person who cannot write, singing or reciting his verses
to an audience that cannot read. History, as we understand it, is
the written record or even the printed volume; it is no longer
the accumulated fund of tribal memories, handed down from father
to sou by oral tradition. Yet everybody knows that, quite apart
from what we usually call literature, there is a great mass of
song and story and miscellaneous lore which circulates among
those who have neither books nor newspapers. To this oral
literature, as the French call it, education is no friend.
Culture destroys it, sometimes with amazing rapidity. When a
nation learns to read, it begins to disregard its traditional
tales; it feels a little ashamed of them; and finally it loses
both the will and the power to remember and transmit them. What
was once the possession of the folk as a whole, becomes the
heritage of the illiterate only, and soon, unless it is gathered
up by the antiquary, vanishes altogether.</p>

<p>To this oral literature belong the popular ballads, and we are
justified, therefore, in calling them "folk-poetry." They are
not, like written literature, the exclusive possession of the
cultivated classes in any community. They belonged, in the first
instance, to the whole people, at a time when there were no
formal divisions of literate and illiterate; when the
intellectual interests of all were substantially identical, from
the king to the peasant. As civilization advanced, they were
banished from polite society, but they lived on among the humble,
among shepherds and ploughboys and "the spinsters and the
knitters in the sun," until even these became too sophisticated
to care for them and they were heard no more.</p>

<p>The process just sketched is not imaginary or merely
inferential. It is, to be sure, impossible, from the nature of
the case, to cite documentary evidence for every step in the
history of the ballads of a given people. But we are not confined
to the limits of a single nationality. Every country of Europe
may be laid under contribution for evidence, and not a little
testimony has come in from other continents. All stages of
civilization are represented in the material that scholars have
brought together, so that we are enabled to speak with entire
confidence. Positive chronology may be out of the question, but
relative chronology is all that one can require in such matters.
The hostility between education and balladry is not conjectural;
its history is known in Great Britain for at least two hundred
years. The homogeneous folk &mdash; that is, the community whose
intellectual interests are the same from the top of the social
structure to the bottom &mdash; is no fiction; examples in
abundance have been observed and recorded. The ability of oral
tradition to transmit great masses of verse for hundreds of years
is proved and admitted. Ballads themselves exist in plenty,
fortunately preserved in old manuscripts or broadsides or taken
down from singing or recitation in recent years. It is possible
to be ignorant of the evidence, no doubt, but it is not possible
to doubt when once the evidence is known. <i>The popular ballads are
really popular, that is, they belong to the folk.</i> So much is
clear. There are problems enough remaining, &mdash; the relation
of the ballads to written literature, their sources, their
origin, the manner of composition, and so on. But these are
secondary questions. The main point is established, and, indeed,
there has never been any reason to dispute it.</p>

<p>The authorship of popular ballads is a question of great
difficulty, which must be considered in due season, but which may
be deferred for the present. Before discussing the different
theories that have been proposed it is well to refer to other
matters that admit of a more satisfactory settlement.</p>

<p>Professor Child's great collection, The English and Scottish
Popular Ballads, in five volumes (Boston, 1882-98), comprises the
whole extant mass of this material. It includes three hundred and
five pieces, most of them in a number of different versions, with
full collations and other pertinent apparatus. A few variants of
this or that ballad have come to light since the publication of
this admirable work, but no additional ballads have been
discovered. Ballad-making, so far as the English-speaking nations
are concerned, is a lost art; and the same may be said of
ballad-singing. A few of the ballads in Mr. Child's collection
are still in oral circulation; but most of them are completely
forgotten or are known only in versions derived from print. Among
those which survive may be mentioned 'Lord Randal,' 'The Wife of
Usher's Well,' < The Maid Freed from the Gallows,' 'Sir Hugh,'
and 'The Twa Sisters.' Much has been lost, and some of the most
precious relics of tradition that we possess have been saved by
mere accident and in a sadly mutilated condition. Yet what has
been preserved is considerable in amount and, on the whole, of
excellent quality. No country has better ballads than those of
England and Scotland.</p>

<p>On pages 677-684 of the present volume will be found a
chronological list of the manuscripts, broadsides, and printed
books from which Professor Child derived the texts which make up
his collection. Only eleven ballads, it will be observed, are
extant in manuscripts older than the seventeenth century. The
unique copy of 'Judas' (No. 29) dates from the thirteenth
century; next, by a long interval, comes 'Riddles Wisely
Expounded' (No. 1), which occurs in a manuscript of about 1445;
slightly later, perhaps, are the manuscripts which contain 'Robin
Hood and the Monk' (No. 119), 'St. Stephen and Herod' (No. 22),
and 'Robyn and Gandeleyn' (No. 115); from about 1500 come our
copies of 'Robin Hood and the Potter' (No. 121) and 'Crow and
Pie' (No. 111); from about 1550 those of 'The Battle of
Otterburn' (No. 161) and the older version of 'The Hunting of the
Cheviot' (No. 162); 'Sir Andrew Barton' (No. 167) and 'Captain
Car' (No. 178) occur in manuscripts of the seventeenth century.
The Percy Folio, which is the most important of all our ballad
manuscripts, is in a hand of about 1650. A few ballads are found
in printed copies of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.
Miscellanies of the seventeenth century preserve a number of
texts, and broadsides of the same century are plentiful. Then we
come to the collectors of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, to whose enthusiasm for popular poetry are due the
majority of the texts which we possess.</p>

<p>Evidently, then, the written and printed documents which we
are studying are, in the main, modern documents. But we are not
to infer that the ballads themselves are necessarily of recent
origin. A sharp distinction must be made between the date of the
book or manuscript in which a ballad occurs and the date of the
ballad itself.</p>

<p>There is ample evidence for the antiquity of popular ballads
in England. Nobody doubts that the Angles and Saxons had them in
abundance when they invaded Britain, and the mediaeval
chroniclers testify to the continuance of the ballad-singing
habit. Indeed, there is no difficulty in proving beyond a
reasonable doubt that there were ballads in plenty from the dawn
of English history (not to speak of what lies before this epoch)
down to the seventeenth century, when written and printed
documents begin to abound. From the nature of the case, however,
such songs very seldom got written down. The substance of many
Anglo-Saxon ballads may be preserved in Be'owulf, but this is an
epic poem of considerable pretensions to artistic structure and
finish, and we cannot hope to extract from it the separate songs
which its author or authors utilized. Much ballad material is
doubtless preserved in chronicles, but the ballads themselves are
not there. Only a limited class of ballads (those of an heroic or
historical character) were likely to afford material to
chroniclers and epic poets. What the people sang would only be
recorded by accident. Thus it is not surprising that we have but
a single ballad written down in the thirteenth century. The
existence of this one text, the 'Judas,' completely popular in
metre, in phraseology, and in what we call atmosphere, is a
valuable piece of evidence. The lack of similar texts for the
next two hundred years is no evidence at all, except, perhaps, of
the fact that such pieces were in the possession of the folk and
circulated from mouth to mouth, but that nobody cared to commit
them to writing. 'St. Stephen and Herod' is just such another
piece as 'Judas' and may be quite as old, yet it did not achieve
the perpetuity of pen and ink until about 1450. 'The Maid and the
Palmer' (No. 21), which is a popular version of the story of the
Samaritan woman in the gospel, belongs to the same class. So far
as we know, however, it was not written down until about 1650,
when it was included in that extraordinary miscellany known as
Bishop Percy's Folio Manuscript. When Percy discovered this
manuscript it was lying under a bureau in the parlor of a country
gentleman's house, and the maids were using it to light fires.
Suppose it had escaped Percy's notice. Another month, another
week, would have sent it up Humphrey Pitts's chimney in smoke. We
should then have no knowledge of the existence of 'The Maid and
the Palmer' in English, except for three stanzas and half of the
burden, which Sir Walter Scott remembered and which were first
printed in 1880 in the second edition of Sharpe's Ballad Book;
but we should make a great mistake if we inferred that 'The Maid
and the Palmer' was to be dated in accordance with the time when
it was first printed or even the time when it was communicated to
Sharpe by Scott. To avoid a possible misapprehension it may be
added that Scott was not aware that this ballad occurs in the
Percy Manuscript. His knowledge of it, in other words, came from
pure oral tradition which was in no manner affected by the
accident that some scribe in the seventeenth century wrote down a
version that was then in circulation. The case of 'The Maid and
the Palmer' is so instructive that we must dwell on it a little
longer. The ballad is not confined to England. There are versions
in Danish, in Faroe, in Norwegian, in Swedish, and in Finnish.
The Danish ballad was printed as a broadside about 1700, and was
also taken down from recitation in 1848 and again in 1869. The
Faroe version is known from about the end of the eighteenth
century, and the same is true of one of the Swedish texts. A
memorandum in the handwriting of Arne Magnusson proves that the
ballad existed in Icelandic in the seventeenth or early
eighteenth century. All these facts are quite independent of the
scribe of the Percy Manuscript and of the recollection of Sir
Walter Scott. Geographical distribution, then, may give valuable
testimony to the antiquity of a ballad. A striking example is
'Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight' (No. 4). This was first printed,
so far as we know, in a broadside of about 1765,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and next in
1776 by Herd, who took it down from singing or recitation. But
these dates are of no value in determining the age of the ballad.
What convinces us that 'Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight' came to
the printer of the broadside and to Herd from an oral tradition
of indeterminable antiquity is its existence among all the
nations of Europe. "It is nearly as well known to the southern as
to the northern nations. It has an extraordinary currency in
Poland. The Germans, Low and High, and the Scandinavians,
preserve it, in a full and evidently ancient form, even in the
tradition of this generation."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> No one can turn over the pages
of Mr. Child's introduction to 'Lady Isabel' without perceiving
that nothing has less significance for the date of any ballad
than the precise moment at which it first excited the interest of
some collector who reduced it to writing, or of some catchpenny
publisher who had it struck off on poor paper in battered type
for the gratification of those who, like Mopsa, love a ballad in
print a-life.</p>

<p>So long as a ballad continues to be handed down by oral
tradition, it is, of course, continuously subjected to the
processes of change which every language undergoes. Hence, a
version derived from recitation or singing in the nineteenth
century will conform, in the main, to the habitual dialect of the
singer or reciter, and thus will be, in a real sense, modern. But
this has nothing to do with the age of the ballad itself. In
printed versions, the linguistic forms may be considerably older
than the date of publication, and the same is true of copies
preserved in manuscript. Thus, the language of the 'Gest of Robin
Hood' (No. 117) is much earlier than 1500, the approximate date
of the first edition that we know of. There is nothing surprising
in this, for Robin Hood ballads were in circulation a good while
before 1377, as the casual mention of them in Piers Plowman
proves.</p>

<p>The considerations set forth in the preceding paragraphs have
an important bearing on another question which has been much
debated, &mdash; the relation between ballads and metrical
romances. Such romances are, on the whole, preserved in
manuscripts much older than the sources from which we derive our
ballad texts, and it has therefore seemed natural to many
scholars to assume without argument that when a romance and a
ballad tell the same story, the ballad is merely a rifacimento of
the romance. Such an inference is, however, by no means a matter
of course. Most romances were literary productions, composed as
modern novels are composed, pen in hand. Clearly, then, if a
written romance was in a given case based upon a ballad which had
never been committed to writing, and which continued to circulate
from mouth to mouth for a century or two before anybody took it
down, the romance, though in fact later than the ballad, would
appear, so far as documentary evidence is concerned, to be the
older of the two. No doubt certain ballads are based upon
metrical romances. Such appears to be the case with 'The Lord of
Lorn and the False Steward' (No. 271), which may probably be a
retelling of 'Roswall and Lillian,' but in general, there is no
presumption in favor of the priority of the romance; and even
when the extant ballad does demonstrably go back to a romance, it
is sometimes probable that the romance itself goes back to a
still older ballad which has perished. A priori considerations
are of little or no value in solving these problems. Each case
requires to be investigated by itself. The reader may find
abundant materials for such investigation in Professor Child's
introductions to 'Hind Horn' (No. 17), 'Sir Lionel' (No. 18),
'King Orfeo' (No. 19), 'Sir Aldingar' (No. 59), and 'Fair Annie'
(No. 62). What has been said of ballads and romances is equally
true of ballads and literary material in general. 'Lady Diamond'
(No. 269) is unquestionably derived in some way from Boccaccio's
Decameron, but nothing is more certain than that Boccaccio's own
tale goes back in the long run to distinctly popular sources.
Certain historical ballads may come from chronicles, but, on the
other hand, it is well known that chroniclers have often drawn
without scruple from legendary songs and other forms of oral
tradition. Only by comparative study of extensive material and
patient scrutiny of details can one hope to arrive at a
satisfactory result in these matters, and it often happens that
the truth lies too far back for us to discover.</p>

<p>Some ballads are historical, or at least are founded on actual
occurrences. In such cases, we have a manifest point of departure
for our chronological investigation. The ballad is likely to have
sprung up shortly after the event and to represent the common
rumor of the time. Accuracy is not to be expected, and indeed too
great historical fidelity in detail is rather a ground of
suspicion than a certificate of the genuinely popular character
of the piece. There can be no object in enumerating the obviously
historical ballads in the present collection; the reader will
easily find most of them for himself by running through the Table
of Contents. But two cautionary observations are necessary. Since
history repeats itself, the possibility and even the probability
must be entertained that every now and then a ballad which had
been in circulation for some time was adapted to the
circumstances of a recent occurrence and has come down to us only
in such an adaptation. It is also far from improbable that many
ballads which appear to have no definite localization or
historical antecedents may be founded on fact, since one of the
marked tendencies of popular narrative poetry is to alter or
eliminate specific names of persons and places in the course of
oral tradition. A good example, though not in a case of
historical derivation, may be seen in 'Hind Horn' (No. 17), and
another in 'King Orfeo' (No. 19). In 'Hind Horn,' but one name is
kept, that of the hero himself, which happened to afford the
opportunity for a kind of pun ("Drink to Horn from the horn"),
and so was preserved. Were it not for this name, we could only
say that the ballad belongs to a great class of stories of which
the romance of 'King Horn' is also a member; we should have no
right to postulate any special connection between the romance and
the ballad. The pretty little Shetland ballad of 'King Orfeo'
comes in some way from the classical tale of Orpheus and
Eurydice, apparently by way of a Middle English lay or romance,
but it has lost the name of the hero and has transformed that of
the heroine into Isabel.</p>

<p>A popular ballad, as we have seen, seldom or never has an
ascertainable date. In fact the precise date of its composition
is not significant in the sense in which the date of an ode or a
sonnet is significant. An artistic poem receives its final form
at the bands of the author at the time of composition. That form
is fixed and authoritative. Nobody either has or supposes that he
has the right to modify it. Any such alteration is an offence, a
corruption, and the critic's duty is to restore the text to its
integrity so that we may have before us what the poet wrote and
nothing else.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The composition of an ode or a sonnet, then,
may be regarded as a single creative act. And with the
accomplishment of this creative act, the account is closed; once
finished, the poem is a definite entity, no longer subject to any
process of development. Not so with the popular ballad. Here the
mere act of composition (which is quite as likely to be oral as
written) is not the conclusion of the matter; it is rather the
beginning. The product as it comes from the author is handed over
to the folk for oral transmission, and thus passes out of his
control. If it is accepted by those for whom it is intended, it
ceases to be the property of the author; it becomes the
possession of the folk, and a new process begins, that of oral
tradition, which is hardly second in importance to the original
creative act. As it passes from singer to singer it is changing
unceasingly. Old stanzas are dropped and new ones are added;
rhymes are altered; the names of the characters are varied;
portions of other ballads work their way in; the catastrophe may
be transformed completely. Finally, if the tradition continues
for two or three centuries, as it frequently does continue, the
whole linguistic complexion of the piece may be so modified with
the development of the language in which it is composed, that the
original author would not recognize his work if he heard it
recited. Taken collectively, these processes of oral tradition
amount to a second act of composition, of an inextricably
complicated character, in which many persons share (some
consciously, others without knowing it), which extends over many
generations and much geographical space, and which may be as
efficient a cause of the ballad in question as the original
creative act of the individual author. It would be a great
mistake to regard the results of what we may call, for want of a
better term, collective composition, as identical with the
corruptions of scribes and editors in the case of a classical
text.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Individually they are sometimes indistinguishable from
such corruptions, but in the aggregate they amount to a distinct
kind of authorship which every student of popular literature is
obliged to recognize, not only as actually operative in the
production of ballads, but as legitimate. They may even result in
the production of new ballads to which no individual author can
lay claim, so completely is the initial act of creative
authorship overshadowed by the secondary act of collective
composition. We may compare the processes of language. A word is
created by somebody. It then becomes the property of the whole
body of those who speak the language, and is subjected to
continuous modification from generation to generation. The
primary act of the original creator of the word is not more
important, and may be far less so, than the secondary acts of his
countrymen who transmit his creation and make it their own as
they pass it on.</p>

<p>It follows that a genuinely popular ballad can have no fixed
and final form, no sole authentic version. There are texts, but
there is no text. Version A may be nearer the original than
versions B and C, but that does not affect the pretensions of B
and C to exist and hold up their heads among their fellows. It
would be interesting if we could have every one of Mr. Child's
three hundred and five ballads exactly as it came from the lips
or hands of its first composer; but such versions, if we could
arrive at them, would not cancel the variants that have come down
to us. Oral transmission and its concomitants are not the
accidents of the ballad, they are essential to it; they are
constituent elements of its very nature. Without them the ballad
would not be the ballad.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have assumed that ballads are initially the work
of individual authors like any other poem, and this may probably
be the truth with respect to most and perhaps all of the English
and Scottish ballads which have survived, although, as we have
seen, the function of the individual author is far less
significant in the production of a genuinely popular ballad than
in the case of poems which are made by the well-defiued process
of artistic composition. A different theory of ballad origins was
held by James Grimm; and the mystery in which his indistinct
utterances involved the subject has long been a matter of
controversy. Grimm's general views on myth, popular poetry, and
fairy tales are well known, and need not here be particularized.
He held that they were, in the fullest sense, the expression of
the spirit of the folk, and that they perpetuated themselves,
ever changing and continually fitting themselves to new
environments, but with little or no intentional alteration on the
part of any given reciter. That these theories were somewhat too
far-reaching was pointed out by his own contemporaries. In the
main, however, if understood with some reserves in particular
cases and with ample allowance for exceptions, little fault can
be found with them. The "mystery" is reached when Grimm declares
that the people, as a whole, composes poetry; das Volk
dichtet.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_0]7','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It is easy enough to understand that the material
for ballads is in the possession of the folk. It is not more
difficult to see that a ballad, when once it exists, becomes the
possession of the folk, and is subjected to those vicissitudes of
oral tradition which, as we have seen, are hardly less important
than the initial act of composition. But the difficulty comes
when we try to figure to ourselves the actual production of a
ballad in the first instance without the agency of an individual
author. For this difficulty Grimm has nowhere provided, nor is it
certain that he was entirely clear in his own mind as to the
scope or the bearings of his theory in this crucial point.</p>

<p>Modern criticism has made merry with Grimm's theory of ballad
authorship. Composition, it is held, must be the act of an
individual; it is inconceivable otherwise; ballads were composed
like other poems; the folk has no voice as a community; it cannot
pour forth unpremeditated and original song in unison. Thus
baldly stated, the objections to Grimm's theory are unanswerable,
for they speak the words of truth and soberness. But Grimm,
though he has not expressed himself with precision, &mdash;
though perhaps he may even be charged with avoiding the direct
issue, &mdash; cannot have meant anything so grossly unreasonable
as the tenets which his opponents ascribe to him. He was not
deficient in common sense, and he certainly had a profound and
rarely sympathetic knowledge of popular literature and of the
popular spirit in all its manifestations. No doubt he uttered
dark oracles, but, though we cannot accept his doctrine in any
literal sense, still that is no valid reason for flying off to
the opposite pole, &mdash; for denying the existence of any
problem and asserting that the only difference between ballads
and other poems turns on the question of anonymity. Such an
explanation is far too simple; it ignores too many observed facts
and leaves uncorrelated too many phenomena which seem to be
connected and which bear at least the appearance of being
significant. Before we allow ourselves to be quite so radical as
this, we should at all events examine Professor Gummere's
theories as to the beginnings of poetry and as to the connection
between communal composition and the ballad.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"Folk" is a large word. It suggests a whole nation, or at all
events a huge concourse of people. Let us abandon it, then, for
the moment, and think rather of a small tribal gathering,
assembled, in very early times, or &mdash; what for the
anthropologist amounts to the same thing &mdash; under very
simple conditions of life, for the purpose of celebrating some
occasion of common interest, &mdash; a successful hunt, or the
return from a prosperous foray, or the repulse of a baud of
marauding strangers. The object of the meeting is known to all;
the deeds which are to be sung, the dance which is to accompany
and illustrate the singing, are likewise familiar to every one.
There is no such diversity of intellectual interests as
characterizes even the smallest company of civilized men. There
is unity of feeling and a common stock, however slender, of ideas
and traditions. The dancing and singing, in which all share, are
so closely related as to be practically complementary parts of a
single festal act. Here, now, we have the "folk" of our
discussion, reduced, as it were, to its lowest terms, &mdash; a
singing, dancing throng subjected as a unit to a mental and
emotional stimulus which is not only favorable to the production
of poetry, but is almost certain to result in such production.
And this is no fancy picture. It is the soberest kind of science,
&mdash; a mere brief chapter of descriptive anthropology, for
which authorities might be cited without number.</p>

<p>Let us next consider the manner in which poetry (the word is
of course used under pardon) is produced in such an assembly.
Here again we can proceed upon just grounds of anthropological
evidence. Different members of the throng, one after another, may
chant each his verse, composed on the spur of the moment, and the
sum of these various contributions makes a song. This is communal
composition, though each verse, taken by itself, is the work of
an individual. A song made in this way is no man's property and
has no individual author. <i>The folk is its author.</i></p>

<p>Communal composition, as just described, is a very simple
matter and its products are infinitely crude. That, however, was
to be expected. Nobody will hold that 'Robin Hood and the Monk'
or 'King Estmere' is the direct result of communal composition.
It is unlikely that even the simplest of our extant ballads were
made in this fashion. We are not now concerned with the
connection, if any there be, between the ballad and the composing
folk. That question will come up presently. What is of importance
at this stage of the discussion is to get clearly in mind not
merely the theoretical possibility of communal composition on a
small scale, but the actual fact of its occurrence. The danger of
misapprehension comes from attaching too dignified a sense to the
phrase or from conceiving the process which it designates as
something systematic or elaborate. All that is required is a
starting-place. It is necessary to know whether men in a low
stage of advancement are familiar with this method of composing,
and that point is satisfactorily established. Further, the
persistence of the habit among civilized peoples in modern times
is a matter of common knowledge. In the Faroe Islands, a few
generations ago, it was common for a group to surround some
fisherman who had been unlucky, or had otherwise laid himself
open to ridicule, and to improvise a song about him, each
contributing his verse or stanza. In the Russian cigarette
factories, the girls who roll the cigarettes amuse themselves,
while at work, by composing songs about each other in a similar
way. One girl begins the song, another follows, and so on, till
the result of this act of strictly communal composition is a
piece of verse which, in some instances, is retained in the
memory and achieves a more or less permanent local reputation.
Everybody has heard children engaged in the communal composition
of satirical rhymes.</p>

<p>Communal composition, then, is nothing unusual or paradoxical.
Not only do we find it among simple peoples in a low state of
civilization, but everybody can remember instances of it which
have come under his own observation among his contemporaries or
in which he has taken part himself. With us it has sunk to the
position of a mere amusement, a children's game perhaps, just as
the elaborate dances of our forefathers have survived only in
such childish dancing games as "Here we go round the gooseberry
bush."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The products of communal composition among us are
trivial and ephemeral, and we fail to observe them, or, at all
events, we seldom think of associating them with literature. We
have come to associate "authorship" with something quite
different from the singing and dancing throng. To us, as has
already been said, an author is a solitary individual sitting in
his study, pen in hand. When, therefore, we read of "communal
authorship," the very idea seems strange and even preposterous.
Yet as soon as we begin to consider, we perceive that we have
always been familiar with the phenomenon in some form or other;
only we have not associated it in our minds with "authorship" at
all.</p>

<p>The origin of poetry, like the origin of language, lies too
far back for us to find. The singing, dancing throng, with its
few rude staves, primitive as it seems in comparison with the
multifariousness of artistic literature, must still be very far
from primitive in the literal sense. For our purpose, however, we
need follow the trail no farther back than this throng. What came
before it is, like the probably arboreal, no concern of ours in
the present discussion. Our business is with the later history of
poetry. Our task is to discern the connection between the
authorship of the extant English and Scottish ballads and the
conditions of communal composition as described by the
anthropologists.</p>

<p>As we examine the most characteristic of these extant ballads
with a view to any peculiarities of technique that may
distinguish them from other poetry, we immediately note certain
features which point straight back to the singing, dancing throng
and to communal composition. These elements have been carefully
studied by Mr. Gummere, so that their significance is
unmistakable. First comes the refrain, which, though its history
is one of the obscurest chapters in literature and art, is
manifestly a point of connection between the ballad and the
throng. The refrain can never have been the invention of the
solitary, brooding author of our modern conditions. It
presupposes a crowd of singers and dancers. Accordingly, as
ballads get farther and farther away from the people or from
singing, they tend to lose their refrains; the recited ballad has
no need of them. It is not meant that all the ballads in this
collection were composed for singing; still less that all of them
once possessed the refrain. Mr. Child's three hundred and five
numbers include, as we shall see in a moment, ballads of many
kinds and illustrate every grade of popularity. What is meant is
rather that there is abundant evidence for regarding the refrain
in general as a characteristic feature of ballad poetry which
gradually ceased to be essential. Some ballads, therefore, retain
this feature; others occur both with and without the refrain;
still others took shape at a time when its use was no longer
obligatory. Exact dates in a matter of this sort are quite out of
the question, and indeed would be destitute of significance if we
could arrive at them, for periods in the history of literary
forms are not like dynasties; one does not come to an end when
the next begins. The refrain, wherever it occurs, whether in
'Robyn and Gandeleyn,' which was written down about 1450, or in
'The Bonny Birdy,' as sung by Mrs. Brown about 1783, is a very
ancient survival which brings the whole category of ballads into
close relations with the singing, dancing throng.</p>

<p>Other elements which point in the same direction are
commonplaces, or recurrent passages, varying from a line to
several stanzas in length. These are to the ballad very much what
idiomatic phrases are to language. Each of them must, at some
time, have been the creation of an individual, but aiJ of them
have become common property. The balladist who utilizes, for
example, the stock stanzas &mdash;</p>

<table>

<p>is not inventing. We may go farther. He is not even quoting
from an individual predecessor, any more than you and I are when,
in the course of conversation, we say "That depends upon
circumstances," or "without let or hindrance."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The
testimony of commonplaces is, indeed, to some extent ambiguous.
Their occurrence is consistent with several different theories of
ballad authorship and ballad growth. Yet they warn us away from
our modern prepossession for the solitary writer, and direct our
thoughts toward less sophisticated and more communal conditions
of authorship.</p>

<p>Simple repetition is so familiar a feature of the ballad style
that it may be dismissed with a word. A message, for instance, is
regularly delivered at full length and in precisely the terms in
which it was entrusted to the messenger. A similar trait, to
which Mr. Gummere has given the apposite name of "incremental
repetition," is even more noteworthy. It may be seen, for
instance, in 'The Twa Sisters' (No. 10), 'The Cruel Brother' (No.
11), and many other ballads. Thus in stanzas 21-26 of 'The Cruel
Brother' we have: &mdash;</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'what will you leave to your father dear?'<br/>
'The silver-shod steed that brought me here.'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'What will you leave to your mother dear?'<br/>
'My velvet pall and my silken gear.'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'What will you leave to your sister Anne?'<br/>
'My silken scarf and my gowden fan.'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'What will you leave to your sister Grace?'<br/>
'My bloody cloaths to wash and dress.'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'What will you leave to your brother John?'<br/>
'The gallows-tree to hang him on.'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'What will you leave to your brother John's wife?'<br/>
'The wilderness to end her life.'</td></tr>

</table>

<p>With these stanzas before us, incremental repetition defines
itself: &mdash; each stanza repeats the substance of the
preceding, but with some variation which advances the story. Here
again, a composing throng is not necessary to explain the
phenomenon, but, given the composing throng as an historical
fact, we cannot fail to recognize this kind of repetition as a
stylistic feature that suits the conditions admirably, and may
probably have arisen in the communal period. Once established,
such a feature would become what we find it &mdash; a bit of
ballad technique.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that there is no lack of characteristic
traits &mdash; besides the general air of impersonality &mdash;
which justify the conjecture that the history of balladry, if we
could follow it back in a straight line without interruptions,
would lead us to very simple conditions of society, to the
singing and dancing throng, to a period of communal composition.
Demonstration, however, is not to be expected, since, from the
very nature of the material, the evidence can never be even
approximately complete in the case of any particular people.
Fortunately, we are not confined to the boundaries of a single
nation or language. What has perished in one country has often
survived in another, and for the earlier stages of the process we
can adduce the plentiful materials which travellers and
anthropologists have collected, &mdash; materials which have the
greater value for our purposes because they were gathered by men
who had no thought of any theory of ballad authorship and were
not concerned with the origin of poetry.</p>

<p>So far we have said nothing of the professional minstrel, to
whom it was formerly the practice of scholars to ascribe the
authorship of ballads. Undoubtedly the minstrel is a very ancient
figure; we can trace him, in various guises, to remote antiquity.
In England, for example, we can follow him back to a time earlier
by many centuries than the oldest ballad text that has come down
to us.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> But, during the periods which we are able to study,
we do not find that the minstrel stands in any such relation to
the genuine and characteristic popular ballad as justifies us in
imagining that he is to have the credit of originating or
perpetuating that class of popular literature. Such ballads as
have been recovered from oral tradition in recent times (and
these, as we have seen, comprise the vast majority of our texts)
have not, except now and then, been taken down from the
recitation or the singing of minstrels, or of any order of men
who can be regarded as the descendants or the representatives of
minstrels. They have almost always been found in the possession
of simple folk whose relation to them was in no sense
professional. They were the property of the people, not of a
limited class or guild of entertainers. A great number of them
(among all nations) have been derived from women, &mdash; the
most stationary part of the community and the farthest removed,
by every instinct and habit, from the roving and irresponsible
professionalism which characterizes the minstrel. Take an
example. 'The Cruel Brother' (No. 11) was furnished to Professor
Child by Miss Margaret Reburn in a version<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> current in
Ireland about 1860. With this as a starting-point, let us see how
far back we can trace the ballad as actually in oral circulation.
In 1858 Aytoun remarks that "this is, perhaps, the most popular
of all the Scottish ballads, being commonly sung and recited even
at the present day." In 1846 Dixon notes that it is still popular
among the peasantry in the west of England. In 1827 Kinloch
recorded it in his manuscripts from the recitation of Mary Barr
of Clydesdale. In 1800 Alexander Fraser Tytler obtained a copy
from Mrs. Brown of Falkland, to whose well-stored memory we owe
some of the best versions of the Scottish ballads. In the last
years of the eighteenth century Mrs. Harris learned the piece, as
a child, and she recited it to her daughter long afterward. In
1869 it was printed in Notes and Queries as "sung in Cheshire
amongst the people" in the preceding century. In 1776 David Herd
recorded it in his manuscript as he had heard it sung. Thus we
have a succession of testimonia for 'The Cruel Brother' from 1860
back to 1776. Nowhere is there any contact with professional
minstrelsy. So much for very modern times.</p>

<p>With 'Johnie Armstrong' (No. 169) the test may be applied for
a century earlier. Goldsmith, who was born in 1728, recalls, in a
famous passage in his Essays (1765), the effect which this ballad
had upon him when a child: "The music of the finest singer is
dissonance to what I felt when our old dairymaid sung me into
tears with Johnny Armstrong's Last Good Night, or the Cruelty of
Barbara Allen." In 1658 the ballad was in existence and was
printed in Wit Restor'd under the title of 'A Northern Ballet,'
and there is no more reason for supposing that it had been in the
possession of the minstrel class between that date and
Goldsmith's boyhood than for supposing that it was their property
between Goldsmith's boyhood and the middle of the nineteenth
century. It is superfluous to multiply examples. The reader can
collect as many as he likes from Mr. Child's volumes. The
following proposition will hardly be controverted by any scholar
who is famibar with the subject: It is capable of practically
formal proof, that for the last two or three centuries the
English and Scottish ballads have not, as a general thing, been
sung and transmitted by professional minstrels or their
representatives. There is no reason whatever for believing that
the state of things between 1300 and 1600 was different, in this
regard, from that between 1600 and 1900, &mdash; and there are
many reasons for believing that it was not different.</p>

<p>One other piece of evidence, complementary to that which we
have been discussing, makes the case against minstrel authorship
almost superfluously convincing. We not only fail to find any
special connection between the professional minstrel and the
great mass of popular ballads, but we do find an intimate
connection between the minstrels and works of an altogether
different order. Ballads are one thiug: the medieval
Spielmannsdichtung or minstrel poetry is another. The two
categories are recognized as distinct by all literary historians.
In fact, they are much more than distinct, &mdash; they are
incommensurable. It is not conceivable that the same order of
mind and the same habits of thought should have produced them
both. The ballads, then, belong to the folk; they are not the
work of a limited professional class, whether of high or of low
degree.</p>

<p>Let us not misunderstand the situation. It is not maintained
that the minstrels never meddled with ballads at all. It was
their business to know all kinds of poetry so as to make
themselves acceptable to all sorts and conditions of men. No
doubt they had a share in carrying ballads from place to place
and in transmitting them to posterity. There is direct proof of
this. We owe our early copy of the 'Hunting of the Cheviot' (No.
162) to Richard Sheale, a humble member of the guild; but we know
that he did not compose the ballad, for we have not only strong
external evidence to the contrary but also four pieces of
Sheale's own (not ballads) which settle the question forever. Of
course the minstrels did sometimes compose in the popular strain.
We have a few minstrel ballads, like 'The Boy and the Mantle'
(No. 29) and 'Crow and Pie' (No. 111), which put this beyond a
peradventure. Not all ballads are of the same origin, as we shall
see presently. But the existence of such ballads is only
additional proof that the bulk of our traditional material is not
of minstrel authorship. The difference between 'The Boy and the
Mantle' and the ballads that come straight from the folk is very
striking. It is the difference between sophistication and
artlessness.</p>

<p>It is time to gather up the threads of our discussion. We have
examined the popular ballad from various points of view, and have
weighed and measured a good many opinions about it. Let us apply
our conclusions to the material that survives, and, so far as
possible, let us see what is to be thought of the origin of the
three hundred and five ballads that lie before us in Professor
Child's collection.</p>

<p>The extant ballads of England and Scotland represent, in the
main, the end of a process of which the beginning may not
improbably be discovered in the period of communal composition.
They were not themselves composed in this way, but were, in the
first instance, the work of individual authors, at least in the
great majority of cases. These authors, however, were not
professional poets or minstrels, but members of the folk, and
their function was in many respects different from that which we
ascribe to an author to-day. Let us try to figure to ourselves a
typical instance. In the first place, the ballad poet stands in a
relation both to his material and to his audience that
distinguishes his activity from that of the conscious literary
artist. His subject is not his own, &mdash; it belongs to the
folk. It is a popular tradition of immemorial antiquity, or a
situation so simple and obvious as to be matter of general
experience, or a recent occurrence which has been taken up by the
mouth of common fame. He has no wish to treat the theme in a
novel way, &mdash; no desire to utter his peculiar feelings about
it or to impress it with his individuality. He is not, like the
artistic poet among us, an exceptional figure with a message,
either of substance or form. He takes no credit to himself, for
he deserves none. What he does, many of his neighbors could do as
well. Accordingly, be is impersonal and without
selfconsciousness. He utters what everybody feels, &mdash; he is
a voice rather than a person. Further, his composition is not a
solitary act. He improvises orally,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> with his audience
before him, &mdash; or rather, with his audience about him. There
is the closest emotional contact between him and his hearers,
&mdash; a contact which must have a distinct effect on the
composer, so that the audience, even if they kept silence (as
they can hardly be supposed to do), would still have a kind of
share in his poetic act. Here is the strongest contrast to the
situation of the modern literary artist, who, in the solitude of
his soundproof study, writes down his own thoughts and feelings,
uncertain who will read them, or even if anybody will read them,
&mdash; addressing himself to an audience in posse, who know
neither his face nor his voice, nor even his handwriting. And the
difference, it will be observed, consists in the function which
the throng (the "folk") performs &mdash; by its mere presence, if
nothing more &mdash; in the production (the "authorship") of
ballad poetry.</p>

<p>Commonly, however, the audience will have a far larger
function than that of sympathetic and stimulative emotional
contact with the author, as we must still call him for want of a
better name. As he composes, the author draws freely on a large
stock of commonplaces which are public property. These are, of
course, entirely familiar to every person in the company, as well
as the points in any narrative (for these are also fixed by
long-standing tradition) at which the conventional stanzas must
come in. When the author arrives at such a point, the audience
join their voices with his. So also in passages which merely
repeat, in identical terms, what has already been said or sung,
as in the delivery of a message. Again, in a succession of
stanzas constructed on the principle of incremental repetition,
the author and the audience may become merged in the same way,
even if the first stanza of the series is in some degree
original. Thus we have arrived at a state of things which is in
effect scarcely to be distinguished from the supposedly
inconceivable phenomenon of a unanimous throng composing poetry
with one voice. That dark oracle das Volk dichtet has interpreted
itself in action, though not without the license which every
Delphic utterance may claim.</p>

<p>For the sake of concreteness, let us apply what has just been
said to a specific example, &mdash; 'The Hangman's Tree,'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
&mdash; taken down from singing in America a few years ago. Miss
Backus, who obtained the ballad, remarks, on the basis of local
information: "This is an old English song, ... which was
brought over to Virginia before the Revolution. It has not been
written for generations, for none of the family have been able to
read or write."</p>

<p>Suppose now that 'The Hangman's Tree' is a new ballad, sung
for the first time by the improvising author. The audience are
silent for the first two stanzas and until the first line of the
third has been finished. After that, they join in the song. So
inevitable is the course of the narrative, so conventionally
fixed the turn of the phraseology, that they could almost finish
the piece by themselves if the author remained silent. At most
they would need his prompting for "meyther," "sister," and
"sweetheart" in stanzas 4, 7, and 10, and for a few words in
stanza 12. If, in accordance with an hypothesis which is
justifiable in many cases, they were familiar with the outline of
the plot, though they had never heard a ballad on the subject,
they would not require even so much assistance as this. The song
is ended, the creative act of composition is finished, &mdash;
and what has become of the author? He is lost in the throng.</p>

<p>'The Hangman's Tree' is, to be sure, an extreme instance of
simplicity in plot and of inevitableness in both structure and
diction; but that does not make it an unfair example. It is a
survival<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_016','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> of an archaic type-specimen, in full vigor of
traditional life, at a very late date, when most of our ballads
belong to much more highly developed genera. As we study it, we
are carried farther back in the direction of communal composition
than we could reasonably hope to get at this age of the world,
&mdash; so far, in truth, that a sanguine theorist might regard
the broken line as repaired again. And 'The Hangman's Tree' is by
no means a solitary specimen of its kind. The ballad literature
of Europe affords examples enough of almost or quite as high a
degree of structural and stylistic simplicity, and similar traits
are visible in many English and Scottish pieces, though seldom to
quite the same extent.</p>

<p>We have described the characteristic method of ballad
authorship as improvisation in the presence of a sympathetic
company which may even, at times, participate in the process.
Such a description is in general warranted by the evidence; and
though it cannot be proved for any of the English and Scottish
ballads, is not improbable for some of them. The actual facts
with regard to any particular piece in this collection are beyond
our knowledge, and the matter need not be insisted on. Even if
none of our ballads were composed in this way, still many of them
conform to a type which was established under the conditions of
authorship referred to. It makes no difference whether a given
ballad was in fact composed in the manner described, or whether
it was composed (or even written) in solitude, provided the
author belonged to the folk, derived his material from popular
sources, made his ballad under the inherited influence of the
method described, and gave it to the folk as soon as he had made
it, &mdash; and provided, moreover, the folk accepted the gift
and subjected it to that course of oral tradition which, as we
have seen, is essential to the production of a genuine ballad.
That most of the three hundred and five numbers in Mr. Child's
collection satisfy these conditions is beyond question. In other
words, most of these poems are genuine popular ballads within the
limits of any reasonable definition of that term. It remains to
speak of certain other pieces and to account for their inclusion
in the book.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_017','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The "minstrel ballad" has already been referred to. Three
undoubted examples, all of first-rate quality, are 'The Boy and
the Mantle' (No. 29), 'King Arthur and King Cornwall' (No. 30),
and 'The Marriage of Sir Gawain' (No. 31). Their characteristics
are felicitously summed up by Professor Child in his introduction
to 'The Boy and the Mantle.' They are, he says, "clearly not of
the same rise, and not meant for the same ears, as those which go
before. They would come down by professional rather than by
domestic tradition, through minstrels rather than knitters and
weavers. They suit the hall better than the bower, the tavern or
public square better than the cottage, and would not go to the
spinning-wheel at all." All three, it should be noticed, stand in
close relation to the materials of mediaeval romantic fiction,
even if they are not directly derived from metrical romances. Yet
they are indubitably ballads, composed in the popular style and
perpetuated for a time by oral tradition. With them should be
compared 'Sir Cawline' (No. 61). This looks as if it were
simplified from a romance in stanzas, which, however, would very
probably itself have been constructed on the basis of ballads now
lost. Minstrel ballads of a later and less popular type are such
historical pieces as 'Durham Field' (No. 159), 'The Rising in the
North' (No. 175), 'Northumberland Betrayed by Douglas' (No. 176),
and 'The Rose of England' (No. 166). The last-mentioned is
remarkable for its use of allegory, which makes it seem far more
artificial than the others. 'The Earl of Westmoreland' (No. 177)
is a curious combination of historical material with romantic
fiction of a conventional order. The cynical 'Crow and Pie' (No.
111) is clearly the work of a minstrel, and stands in a class by
itself; as a whole, it might be refused the designation of
popular ballad, but it contains one passage (stanzas 9-14) which
justifies its inclusion in a collection of this kind, especially
in view of the age of the manuscript.</p>

<p>"Broadside ballads" are of two main classes, which are really
quite distinct: those that are traditional and those that are
not. In the seventeenth century there was a great demand for
printed ballads, and there grew up a class of professional
"purveyors to the press," as Mr. Child calls them, who were kept
busy in supplying materials for the single-page issues which were
hawked about by pedlars aud with which every alehouse seems to
have been papered. Many traditional ballads were printed in this
form, usually in debased versions. Now and then a good old ballad
was made over by some hack-writer, and when this was the case,
the broadside text, though a pitiful specimen of Grub Street
versification, may preserve the substance of a lost traditional
ballad. A probable instance is 'The Famous Flower of Serving-Men'
(No. 106). Still more remarkable is 'The Suffolk Miracle' (No.
272), which is the only representative iu English of the
so-called Lenore cycle. The great majority of the broadside
ballads, however, belong to the second, or non-traditional class,
and have no claim to be admitted into a collection like that of
Professor Child. It is to rubbish of this character that the
scornful allusions to ballad-mongers in Shakspere aud the other
Elizabethan dramatists have reference. Hundreds of such pieces
have been reprinted by the Ballad Society. They are generally
composed in some form of the ballad stanza, and they use some of
the commonplaces of the ballad style, but they are destitute of
merit, and, though they are of value to the student of language
and manners, they have nothing to do with the subject of this
essay.</p>

<p>Several broadside ballads of the poorer sort will be found
among the thirty-eight numbers (117-154) relating to Robin Hood.
Some of these are inserted because they presumably or conceivably
are based on earlier and more traditional pieces; others because
they embody a situation which occurs in genuine ballads; still
others because, though of no value in themselves and destitute of
any claim to traditional antecedents, they are a part of the
evidence about the famous outlaw and illustrate the literary
history of balladry. Taken as a whole, the Robin Hood pieces
afford materials of the highest interest for the study of ballad
and epic. The older ballads are in the best traditional vein. The
'Gest' (No. 117) is, as Mr. Child says, "a popular epic, composed
from several ballads by a poet of a thoroughly congenial spirit.
No one of the ballads from which it is made up is extant in a
separate shape, and some portions of the story may have been of
the compiler's own invention." It may be contrasted with Nos. 149
and 154. The former, 'Robin Hood's Birth, Breeding, Valor, and
Marriage,' is a jocular piece, the work of some
seventeenth-century rhymester who cared nothing for tradition and
to whom the simplicity of the ballad style suggested only a
temptation to good-humored caricature. The latter, Martin
Parker's 'True Tale of Robin Hood,' is a prosaic omnium gatherum,
professing to be authentic biography. It is the only text in Mr.
Child's whole collection which is the work of a known author.
'Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon' (No. 129) is a kind of
metrical romance in the ballad stanza. Garlands, or little
pamphlets of verse, differing from broadsides only in their form,
are the authorities for several of our Robin Hood 
texts.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_018','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The mere fact that a ballad is derived from recitation is of
course no positive proof that it is traditional. Imitations and
counterfeits may be fabricated orally or may be written down and
furnished to guileless collectors as from the mouths of the
people. Some of the later pieces in this collection are very
suspicious and others are almost certainly spurious. What to
include and what to reject is a difficult question, which no two
scholars would answer in precisely the same way. It is fitting,
however, that the student of literary history should have before
him specimens of the decadent period. Occasionally, too, such
imitations contain stanzas of value, or are otherwise
significant. Thus 'Willie's Fatal Visit' (No. 255) is a
hotch-potch of three ballads with one stanza from a fourth; yet
it contains a very spirited passage (stanzas 15-17) which is
unknown elsewhere and worthy of preservation for its own sake.
Who put the piece together we cannot tell, &mdash; perhaps the
blind beggar whom Buchan employed to collect for him. In any
case, the conglomerate is instructive; for it shows how new
ballads may come into existence by a process of amalgamation, and
this is a process which is quite as active among the folk as in
the laboratory of the counterfeiter. David Herd is above
suspicion, and he lived at a time when good ballads were abundant
and tradition was still pure and vigorous; whatever occurs in his
manuscripts may be unhesitatingly accepted as a faithful
transcript from the lips of the people. Yet he records a copy of
'Clerk Saunders' (No. 69) consisting of forty-one stanzas, the
last fifteen of which are merely 'Sweet William's Ghost' (No. 77)
slightly modified so as to fit what precedes. This is the
simplest kind of traditional compounding. A similar example may
be seen in the copy of 'The Clerk's Twa Sons o Owsenford' (No.
72) preserved in the memory of the grandmother of Robert
Chambers, which concludes with a beautiful fragment of 'The Wife
of Usher's Well' (No. 79). Complications less easy to disentangle
may be seen by studying the relations of 'Willie o Douglas Dale'
(No. 101), 'Willie and Earl Richard's Daughter' (No. 102), and
'Rose the Red and White Lily' (No. 103) to each other and to
'Leesome Brand' (No. 15). Here both tradition and manufacture
have been operative. A good example of contamination which has
not resulted in the genesis of a new ballad occurs in the "old
lady's" version of 'The Mother's Malison' (No. 216 A), which has
appropriated an incident that belongs to 'The Lass of Roch Royal'
(No. 76). To appreciate the full effects of oral tradition in
this and other directions, the investigator must have recourse to
the full body of variants printed by Professor Child in his large
collection. The present volume, however, contains examples enough
to illustrate and enforce what has been said of the significance
of oral tradition in the problem of ballad "authorship."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_019','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It was
no doubt the feeling that the popular ballad is a fluid and
unstable thing that has prompted so many editors &mdash; among
them Sir Walter Scott, whom it is impossible to assail, however
much the scholarly conscience may disapprove &mdash; to deal
freely with the versions that came into their hands. "Doch
Homeride zu seyn, auch nur als letzter, ist schon"!</p>

<p>Of literary "imitations of the ancient ballad" little need be
said. Even when the polite authors of such pieces have palmed
them off as genuine, one must rather wonder that the imposture
succeeded than give way to anger at the attempt. Nobody who is at
all well-read in genuine "oral literature" can be deceived. Lady
Wardlaw's 'Hardy-cnute,' which puzzled many brains in its time,
has not a single ballad touch; its two good lines, &mdash;</p>

<p>have nothing popular about them. The Rev. Mr. Lamb's 'Laidley
Worm of Spindleston Heughs,' which he gave out as "made by the
old Mountain Bard, Duncan Frasier, living on Cheviot, A. D.
1270,"<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p04_020','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> was hardly meant to deceive, and would not be
dangerous if it had been so meant. In short, the traditional
ballad appears to be inimitable by any person of literary
cultivation, and we may well feel grateful to those poets and
poetasters who have tried their hands at it, for their invariable
failure is one of the strongest proofs &mdash; amounting almost
to demonstration &mdash; that there is a difference between the
"poetry of the folk" and "the poetry of art." A solitary, though
doubtful, exception is 'Kinmont Willie' (No. 186), which is under
vehement suspicion of being the work of Sir Walter Scott. Sir
Walter's success, however, in a special kind of balladry for
which he was better adapted by nature and habit of mind than for
any other, would only emphasize the universal failure. And it
must not be forgotten that 'Kinmont Willie,' if it be Scott's
work, is not made out of whole cloth; it is a working-over of one
of the best traditional ballads known ('Jock o the Side'), with
the intention of fitting it to an historical exploit of
Buccleuch's. Further, the exploit itself was of such a nature
that it might well have been celebrated in a ballad, &mdash;
indeed, one is tempted to say that it must have been so
celebrated. And finally, Sir Walter Scott felt towards "the
Kinmont" and "the bold Buccleuch" precisely as the moss-trooping
author of such a ballad would have felt. For once, then, the
miraculous happened, &mdash; and, when we study the situation, we
perceive that, for this once, it was not so great a miracle after
all.</p>

<p>Peter Buchan's blind beggar has been casually mentioned, but
he is too notorious a personage to dismiss without more
formality. There is a good deal of his work in Mr. Child's
collection (most of it omitted in the present volume), and an
attempt must be made to determine his position, and in particular
his significance, in the history of oral tradition. It is hard to
be patient with James Rankin (for that was his name), but perhaps
we may see occasion for something better than patience before we
have done with him. Liar though he was, his falsehoods may give
evidence that a truthteller could not afford us.</p>

<p>Buchan's Ancient Ballads and Songs of the North of Scotland,
for which Rankin's industry as collector, composer, and
rhapsodist furnished much of the material, appeared in 1828. Some
of the ballads which it contains are found nowhere else, and most
of these are suspicious enough, though several of them are
reproduced by Mr. Child, and repeated in this volume, on the same
principle which has led to the inclusion of certain dubious
broadsides &mdash; because they may preserve more or less genuine
material in a disguised shape. Most of Buchan's texts, however,
are versions of ballads otherwise vouched for. In this case, they
are almost always the longest versions known, padded with
superfluous details (often silly beyond expression), tricked out
with pinchbeck finery, and thoroughly vulgarized in style and
spirit. Here we have the work of Rankin, who seems to have been
paid by the yard, and who found his honest patron an easy man to
cajole. Now the significance of James Rankin lies in the fact
that he was in effect a professional minstrel of the humbler
order, or at least the lineal descendant or representative of the
minstrel class of former times. When we compare his own
productions, or the versions which he has recomposed, with those
which other collectors were deriving at about the same time from
non-professional sources, &mdash; shepherds, ploughmen, nurses,
and other simple bodies who had no touch of literature and no
ambition except to sing the old songs as they had heard them
sung, &mdash; we see in a moment the absurdity of the notion that
our popular ballads were composed or even largely transmitted by
minstrels. And thus one chapter, and a troublesome one, of our
investigation is brought to a satisfactory close.</p>

<p>We have touched upon most of the problems that confront the
investigator of the popular ballad. Certain others, like that of
the transmission of ballads from country to country, which
includes the special question of kinship between the English and
Scottish ballads and those of Scandinavia, do not come within the
scope of this introduction. The same is true of the history of
ballad collections, which would take much space, and in lieu of
which the reader is referred once more to the List of Sources on
pp. 677-684.</p>

<p>Of the merit of the English and Scottish ballads nothing need
be said. It is unhesitatingly admitted by all persons who care
for ballads at all. There is no occasion to make comparisons as
to excellence between these pieces and the poetry of art. Such
comparisons are misleading; they tend only to confound the
distinctions between two very different categories of literature.
The ballads must stand or fall by themselves, not by reason of
their likeness or unlikeness to Dante or Shakspere or Milton or
Browning. Above all things, they should not be judged
indiscriminately or in the lump. There are good ballads and poor
ballads, as there are good dramas and poor dramas, and this
volume contains an abundance of both sorts. On the whole,
however, the average of excellence is probably as high as in most
volumes of verse of equal dimensions. Finally, the popular
ballad, though it may be despised, cannot be ignored by the
student of literature. Whatever may be thought of the importance
of such verse in its bearing on the origin of poetry in general,
or of epic poetry in particular, the ballad, like other forms of
popular material, has in the last two centuries exercised a
powerful influence on artistic literature, and it will always
have to be reckoned with by the literary historian.</p>
