<p>All these versions of 'Kempy Kay' are known, or may be
presumed, to have been taken down within the first three decades
of this century; <b>A</b> is traced as many years back into the
last. The fourth stanza of <b>A</b> clearly belongs to some other
ballad. Both <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> appear to have undergone some
slight changes when published by Sharpe and Kinloch
<a name="Page_I_301"/>
respectively.
Some verses from this ballad have been adopted into one form of a
still more unpleasant piece in the Campbell collection,
concerning a wife who was "the queen of all sluts."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d033_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Sharpe remarks: "This song my learned readers will perceive to
be of Scandinavian origin, and that the wooer's name was probably
suggested by Sir Kaye's of the Round Table. ... The description
of Bengoleer's daughter resembles that of the enchanted damsel
who appeared to courteous King Henrie." It is among possibilities
that the ballad was an outgrowth from some form of the story of
The Marriage of Sir Gawain, in the Percy version of which the
"unseemly" lady is so rudely commented on and rejected by Kay.
This unseemly lady, in The Wedding of Gawen and Dame Ragnell, and
her counterpart in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_32.html">King Henry</a>,' who is of superhuman height,
show an extravagant voracity which recalls the giantess in 'Greve
Genselin.' In 'Greve Genselin,' a burlesque form of an heroic
ballad which is preserved in a pure shape in three
F&auml;r&ouml;e versions (Grundtvig, IV, 737-42), there are many
kemps invited to the wedding, and in a little dance which is had
the smallest kemp is fifteen ells to [below] the knee, Grundtvig,
No 16, <b>A</b> 26, <b>B</b> 29, <b>C</b> 29. Kempy Kay has
gigantic dimensions in <b>A</b> 7, <b>C</b> 9, <b>E</b> 7: teeth
like tetherstakes, a nose three [nine, five] feet long, three
ells [nine yards] between his shoulders, a span between his
eyne.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d033_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Of the bride it is said in <b>A</b> 12 that her finger
nails were like the teeth of a rake and her teeth like
tetherstakes. This is not decisive; it is her ugliness,
filthiness, and laziness that are made most of. We may assume
that she would be in dimension and the shape of nature a match
for the kemp, but she does not comport herself especially like a
giantess.</p>

<p>If Kempy Kay be the original name of the wooer, Knapperty and
Chickmakin might easily be derived from corrupt pronunciations
like Kampeky, Kimpaky.</p>
