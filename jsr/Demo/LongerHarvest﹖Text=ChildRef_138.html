<p>Printed in A Collection of Old Ballads, 1723, II, 44, and
Evans's Old Ballads, 1777, 1784, I, 126, after a copy very near
to <b>c</b>. In Ritson's Robin Hood, 1795, II, 46, probably after
Roxburghe II, 394. Not included in the garlands of 1663, 1670; in
a garland of 1749, the Aldermary garland, R. Marshall, and the
Lichfield, M. Morgan, both not dated, No 8; in the York garland,
1811, No 9. In the Kinloch Manuscripts, V, 183, there is a copy,
derived from the broadside, but Scotticised, and improved in the
process.</p>

<p>A young man, Allen a Dale, whom Robin Hood has seen passing,
one day singing and the next morning sighing, is stopped by
Little John and the Miller's Son, and brought before their
master, who asks him if he has any money. He has five shillings
and a ring, and was to have been married the day before, but his
bride has been given to an old knight. Robin asks what he will
give to get his true-love. All that he can give is his faithful
service. Robin goes to the church and declares the match not fit:
the bride shall choose for herself. He blows his horn, and
four-and-twenty of his men appear, the foremost of whom is Allen
a Dale. Robin tells Allen that he shall be married on the spot.
The bishop says no; there must be three askings. Robin puts the
bishop's coat on Little John, and Little John asks seven times.
Robin gives Allen the maid, and bids the man take her away that
dare.</p>

<p>The ballad, it will be observed, is first found in broadside
copies of the latter half of the seventeenth century. The story
is told of Scarlock in the life of Robin Hood in Sloane
Manuscript 715, 7, fol. 157, of the beginning of the seventeenth
century; Thorns, Early Prose Romances, II, p. 39.</p>

<p>"Scarlock he induced [to become one of his company] upon this
occacion. One day meting him as he walked solitary and lyke to a
man forlorne, because a mayd to whom he was affyanced was taken
from [him] by the violence of her frends, and given to another,
that was auld and welthy; whereupon Robin, understandyng when the
maryage-day should be, came to the church as a beggar, and having
his company not far of, which came in so sone as they hard the
sound of his home, he 'took' the bryde perforce from him that was
in hand to have maryed her, and caused the preist to wed her and
Scarlocke togeyther."</p>
