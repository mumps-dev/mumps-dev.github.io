<p>The title 'Lord Randal' is selected for this ballad because
that name occurs in one of the better versions, and because it
has become familiar through Scott's Minstrelsy. Scott says that
the hero was more generally termed Lord Ronald: but in the
versions that have come down to us this is not so. None of these
can be traced back further than a century. <b>P</b> and <b>D</b>
were the earliest published. Jamieson remarks with respect to
<b>G</b> (1814): "An English gentleman, who had never paid any
attention to ballads, nor ever read a collection of such things,
told me that when a child he learnt from a playmate of his own
age, the daughter of a clergyman in Suffolk, the following
imperfect ditty." <b>I</b>, a version current in eastern
Massachusetts, may be carried as far back as any. <b>a</b>,
<b>b</b> derive from Elizabeth Foster, whose parents, both
natives of eastern Massachusetts, settled, after their marriage,
in Maine, where she was born in 1789. Eliza beth Foster's mother
is remembered to have sung the ballad, and I am informed that the
daughter must have learned it not long after 1789, since she was
removed in her childhood from Maine to Massachusetts, and
continued there till her death. 'Tiranti' ['Taranti'] may not
improbably be a corruption of Lord Randal.</p>

<p>The copy in Smith's Scottish Minstrel, III, 58, is Scott's
altered. The first four stanzas are from the Border Minstrelsy,
except the last line of the fourth, which is from Johnson's
Museum. The last two stanzas are a poor modern invention.</p>

<p>Three stanzas which are found in <b>A</b>. Cunningham's
Scottish Songs, I, 286 f, may be given for what they are worth.
'The house of Marr,' in the first, is not to be accepted on the
simple ground of its appearance in his pages. The second is
inserted in his beautified edition of Scott's ballad, and has its
burden accordingly; but there is, besides this, no internal
evidence against the second, and none against the third.</p>

<p>'O where have you been, Lord Ronald, my son?<br/>
where have you been, my handsome young man?'<br/>
'At the house of Marr, mother, so make my bed soon,<br/>
For I 'm wearied with hunting, and fain would lie down.'</p>

<p>'where did she find them, Lord Randal, my son?<br/>
O where did she catch them, my handsome young man?'<br/>
'Neath the bush of brown bracken, so make my bed soon,<br/>
For I 'm wae and I 'm weary, and fain would lie down.'</p>

<p>'what got your bloodhounds, Lord Ronald, my son?<br/>
what got your bloodhounds, my handsome young man?'<br/>
'They lapt the broo, mother, so make my bed soon,<br/>
I am wearied with hunting, and fain would lie down.'</p>

<p>A pot-pourri or quodlibet, reprinted in Wolff's Egeria, p. 53,
from a Veronese broad side of the date 1629, shows that this
ballad was popular in Italy more than 250 years ago; for the last
but one of the fragments which make up the medley happens to be
the first three lines of 'L'Avvelenato,' very nearly as they are
sung at the present day, and these are introduced by a summary of
the story:</p>

<p>"lo vo' finire con questa <i>d'un amante<br/>
Tradito dall' amata.</i><br/>
Oh che l'&egrave; si garbata<br/>
A cantarla in ischiera:<br/>
<i>'Dov' andastu iersera,<br/>
Figliuol mio ricco, savio e gentile?<br/>
Dov' andastu iersera '?"</i><a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d012_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The ballad was first recovered in 1865, by Dr. G.B. Bolza, who
took it down from the singing of very young girls at Loveno.
Since then good copies have been found at Venice. <b>A</b>,
'L'Avvelenato,' Bolza, Canzoni popolari comasche, No 49,
Sitzungsberichte of the Vienna Academy (philos. histor. class),
LIII,
<a name="Page_I_153"/>
668, is of seventeen stanzas, of seven short lines, all of
which repeat but two: the 8th and 10th stanzas are
imperfect.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d012_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A mother inquires of her son where he has been.
He has been at his mistress's, where he has eaten part of an eel;
the rest was given to a dog, that died in the street. The mother
declares that he has been poisoned. He bids her send for the
doctor to see him, for the curate to shrive him, for the notary
to make his will. He leaves his mother his palace, his brothers
his carriage and horses, his sisters a dowry, his servants a free
passage to mass ("la strada d'anda a messa" = nothing), a hundred
and fifty masses for his soul; for his mistress the gallows to
hang her. <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, 'L'Avvelenato,' Bernoni, Nuovi
Canti popolari veneziani, 1874, No 1, p. 5, p. 3, have twelve and
eighteen four-line stanzas, the questions and answers in
successive stanzas, and the last three lines of the first pair
repeated respectively throughout,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d012_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> <b>B</b>, which is given
as a variant of <b>C</b>, agrees with <b>A</b> as to the agent in
the young man's death. It is his mistress in <b>B</b>, but in
<b>C</b> it is his mother. In both, as in <b>A</b>, he has eaten
of an eel. The head he gave to the dogs, the tail to the cats
(<b>C</b>). He leaves to his stewards (castaldi) his carriages
and horses (<b>C</b>); to his herdsmen his cows and fields; to
the maids his chamber furnishings; to his sister the bare
privilege of going to mass (<b>C</b>, as in <b>A</b>); to his
mother [wife, <b>C</b>] the keys of his treasure. "La forca per
picarla" is in <b>B</b> as in <b>A</b> the bequest to his false
love, in stead of whom we have his mother in <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>The corresponding German ballad has been known to the English
for two generations through Jamieson's translation. The several
versions, all from oral tradition of this century, show the same
resemblances and differences as the English.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, 'Schlangenk&ouml;chin,' eight stanzas of
six lines, four of which are burden, <b>A</b>, Liederhort, p. 6,
No 2 a , from the neighborhood of Wilsnack, Brandenburg, B,
Peter, I, 187, No 6, from Weidenau, Austrian Silesia, run thus:
Henry tells his mother that he has been at his sweetheart's (but
not a-hunting); has had a speckled fish to eat, part of which was
given to the dog [cat, <b>B</b>], which burst. Henry wishes his
father and mother all blessings, and hell-pains to his love,
<b>A</b> 6-8. His mother, <b>B</b> 8, asks where she shall make
his bed: he replies, In the church-yard. <b>C</b>, 'Grossmutter
Schlangenk&ouml;chin,' first published in 1802, in Maria's
(Clemens Brentano's) romance Godwi, II, 113, afterward in the
Wunderhorn, 1, 19 (ed. 1819, I, 20, ed. 1857), has fourteen
two-line stanzas, or seven of four lines, one half burden. The
copy in Zuccalmaglio, p. 217, No 104, "from Hesse and North
Germany," is the same thing with another line of burden
intercalated and two or three slight changes. Maria has been at
her grandmother's, who gave her a fish to eat which she had
caught in her kitchen garden; the dog ate the leavings, and his
belly burst. The conclusion agrees with <b>B</b>, neither having
the testament. <b>D</b>, 'Stiefmutter,' seven stanzas of four
short lines, two being burden, Uhland, No 120, p. 272; excepting
one slight variation, the same as Liederhort, p. 5, No 2, from
the vicinity of B&uuml;ckeburg, Lippe-Schaumburg. A child has
been at her mother's sister's house, where she has had a
well-peppered broth and a glass of red wine. The dogs [and cats]
had some broth too, and died on the spot. The child wishes its
father a seat in heaven, for its mother one in hell. <b>E</b>,
<a name="Page_I_154"/>
'Kind, wo bist du denn henne west?' Reiffenberg, p. 8, No 4, from
Bokendorf, Westphalia, four stanzas of six lines, combining
question and answer, two of the six burden. A child has been at
its step-aunt's, and has had a bit of a fish caught in the
nettles along the wall. The child gives all its goods to its
brother, its clothes to its sister, but three devils to its
[step-] mother. <b>F</b>, 'Das vergiftete kind,' seven four-line
stanzas, two burden, Schuster, Siebenb&uuml;rgisch-s&auml;chsische
V. L., p. 62, No 58, from M&uuml;hlbach. A child tells its father
that its heart is bursting; it has eaten of a fish, given it by
its mother, which the father declares to be an adder. The child
wishes its father a seat in heaven, its mother one in hell.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, <b>B</b> are nearer to 'Lord Randal,' and have even
the name Henry which we find in English <b>C</b>.
<b>C</b>-<b>P</b> are like <b>J</b>-<b>O</b>, 'The Croodlin
Doo.'</p>

<p><b>Dutch</b>. 'Isabella,' Snellaert, p. 73, No 67, seven
four-line stanzas, the first and fourth lines repeated in each.
Isabel has been sewing at her aunt's, and has eaten of a fish
with yellow stripes that had been caught with tongs in the
cellar. The broth, poured into the street, caused the dogs to
burst. She wishes her aunt a red-hot furnace, herself a spade to
bury her, her brother a wife like his mother.</p>

<p><b>Swedish</b>. <b>A</b>, 'Den lillas Testamente,' ten
five-line stanzas, three lines burden, Afzelius, in, 13, No 68;
ed. Bergstr&ouml;m, I, 291, No 55. A girl, interrogated by her
step-mother, says she has been at her aunt's, and has eaten two
wee striped fishes. The bones she gave the dog; the stanza which
should describe the effect is wanting. She wishes heaven for her
father and mother, a ship for her brother, a jewel-box and chests
for her sister, and hell for her step-mother and her nurse.
<b>B</b>, Arwidsson, II, 90, No 88, nine five-line stanzas, two
lines burden. In the first stanza, evidently corrupt, the girl
says she has been at her brother's. She has had eels cooked with
pepper, and the bones, given to the dogs, made them burst. She
gives her father good corn in his barns, her brother and sister a
ship, etc., hell to her step-mother and nurse.</p>

<p><b>Danish</b>. Communicated by Prof. Grundtvig, as obtained
for the first time from tradition in 1877; five stanzas of five
lines, three lines repeating. Elselille, in answer to her mother,
says she has been in the meadow, where she got twelve small
snakes. She wishes heavenly joy to her father, a grave to her
brother, hell torment to her sister.</p>

<p><b>Magyar</b>. 'Der vergiftete Knabe,' Aigner, Ungarische
Volksdichtungen, 2 e Auflage, p. 127, in nine six-line stanzas,
four being a burden. Johnnie, in answer to his mother, says he
has been at his sister-in-law's, and has eaten a speckled toad,
served on her handsomest plate, of which he is dying. He
bequeaths to his father his best carriage, to his brothers his
finest horses, to his sister his house furniture, to his
sister-in-law everlasting damnation, to his mother pain and
sorrow.</p>

<p><b>Wendish</b>. 'Der vergiftete Knabe,' Haupt u. Schmaler, I,
110, No 77, twelve four-line stanzas, combining question and
answer, the first and last line repeating. Henry has been at the
neighbor's, has eaten part of a fish caught in the stable with a
dung-fork; his dog ate the rest, and burst. There is no
testament. His mother asks him where she shall make his bed; he
replies, In the churchyard; turn my head westward, and cover me
with green turf.</p>

<p>The numerous forms of this story show a general agreement,
with but little difference except as to the persons who are the
object and the agent of the crime. These are, according to the
Italian tradition, which is 250 years old, while no other goes
back more than a hundred years, and far the larger part have been
obtained in recent years, a young man and his true-love; and in
this account unite two of the three modern Italian versions,
English <b>A</b>-<b>G</b>, German <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. Scott
suggests that the handsome young sportsman (whom we find in
English <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>H</b>) may have been exchanged for a little child poisoned by
a step-mother, to excite greater interest in the nursery. This
seems very reasonable. What girl with a lover, singing the
ballad, would not be tempted to put off the treacherous act on so
popular, though most unjustly popular, an object of aversion? A
mother, again,
<a name="Page_I_155"/>
would scarcely allow "mother" to stand, as is the
case in Italian <b>C</b> and German <b>F</b>, and a singer who
considered that all blood relations should be treated as sacred
would ascribe the wickedness to somebody beyond that pale, say a
neighbor, as the Wendish ballad does, and Zuccalmaglio's reading
of German <b>C</b>. The step-mother is expressly named only in
English <b>J</b>, <b>K</b> <b>c</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>,
<b>N</b>, <b>O</b>, and in four of these, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>
<b>c</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>O</b>, the child has a mammie,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d012_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> which
certainly proves an <i>alibi</i> for the step-mother, and
confirms what Scott says. There is a step-aunt in German <b>E</b>
and Swedish <b>A</b>, and the aunt in German <b>D</b> and the
Dutch ballad, and the grandmother in English <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>
<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, German <b>C</b>, are perhaps meant (as the
brother in Swedish <b>B</b> certainly is) to be step-relations
and accommodating instruments.</p>

<p>The poisoning is shifted to a wife in English <b>H</b>, to an
uncle in English <b>I</b> <b>d</b>, and to a sister-in-law in the
Magyar version.</p>

<p>There is all but universal consent that the poisoning was done
by serving up snakes for fish. The Magyar says a toad, English
<b>M</b> a four-footed fish,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d012_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> German <b>D</b> a well-peppered
broth and a glass of red wine. English <b>L</b> adds a drink of
hemlock stocks to the speckled trout; <b>F</b>, <b>H</b> have
simply poison. The fish are distinctively eels in the Italian
versions, and in English <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>I</b>, Swedish <b>B</b>. English <b>A</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>, German <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>, the
Italian, Swedish, Dutch, Wendish versions, and by implication
English <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b> also, concur in saying that
a part of the fish was given to a dog [dogs, cat, cats], and that
death was the consequence. 'Bursting or swelling is
characteristic of this kind of poisoning: German <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, English <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, and the
Dutch and Wendish versions.</p>

<p>The dying youth or child in many cases makes a nuncupative
will, or declares his last wishes, upon a suggestion proceeding
from the person who is by him, commonly from the mother: English
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>: German
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>: the Italian, Dutch,
Swedish, Danish, Magyar versions. The bequest to the poisoner is
the gallows in English <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>,
Italian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>; hell, English <b>A</b>,
German <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
Danish; and an equivalent in German <b>E</b>, the Dutch and the
Magyar copy. '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_11.html">The Cruel Brother</a>,' No 11, and
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_13.html">Edward</a>,' No 13,
have a will of this same fashion.</p>

<p>In all the English versions the burden has the entreaty "Make
my bed," and this is addressed to the mother in all but <b>L</b>,
<b>N</b>. In <b>H</b>, an Irish copy, and <b>I</b>, an American
one, the mother asks where the bed shall be made; and the answer
is, In the churchyard. This feature is found again in German
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b> and in the Wendish version.</p>

<p>The resemblance in the form of the stanza in all the versions
deserves a word of remark. For the most part, the narrative
proceeds in sections of two short lines, or rather half lines,
which are a question and an answer, the rest of the stanza being
regularly repeated. English <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>, as written
(<b>L</b> not always), separate the question and answer; this is
done, too, in Italian <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. German <b>E</b>, on the
contrary, has two questions and the answers in each stanza, and
is altogether peculiar. Swedish <b>B</b> varies the burden in
part, imagining father, brother, sister, etc., to ask what the
little girl will give to each, and adapting the reply
accordingly, "Faderen min," "Broderen min."</p>

<p>A Bohemian and a Catalan ballad which have two of the three
principal traits of the foregoing, the poisoning and the
testament, do not exhibit, perhaps have lost, the third, the
employment of snakes.</p>

<p>The story of the first is that a mother who dislikes the wife
her son has chosen attempts to poison her at the wedding feast.
She sets a glass of honey before the son, a glass of poison
before the bride. They exchange cups. The poison is swift. The
young man leaves four horses to his brother, eight cows to his
sister, his fine house to his wife. "And
<a name="Page_I_156"/>
what to me, my son?"
asks the mother. A broad mill-stone and the deep Moldau is the
bequest to her. Waldau, Bb'hmische Granaten, n, 109, cited by
Reifferscheid, p. 137 f.</p>

<p>The Catalan ballad seems to have been softened at the end.
Here again a mother hates her daughter-in-law. She comes to the
sick woman, "com qui no 'n sabes res," and asks What is the
matter? The daughter says, You have poisoned me. The mother
exhorts her to confess and receive the sacrament, and then make
her will. She gives her castles in France to the poor and the
pilgrims [and the friars], and to her brother Don Carlos [who in
one version is her husband]. Two of the versions remember the
Virgin. "And to me?" "To you, my husband [my cloak, rosary], that
when you go to mass you may remember me." In one version the
mother asks the dying woman where she will be buried. She says At
Saint Mary's. Mila, Observaciones, p. 103 f, No 5, two versions:
Briz y Salt6, II, 197 f, two also, the first nearly the same as
Mila's first.</p>

<p>Poisoning by giving a snake as food, or by infusing the venom
in drink, is an incident in several other popular ballads.</p>

<p>Donna Lombarda attempts, at the instigation of a lover, to rid
herself of her husband by pounding a serpent, or its head, in a
mortar, and mixing the juice with his wine [in one version simply
killing the snake and put ting it in a cask]: Nigra, Canzoni del
Piemonti, in Rivista Contemporanea, xn, 32 ff, four versions;
Marcoaldi, p. 177, No 20; Wolf, Volkslieder aus Venetien, p. 46,
No 72; Righi, Canti popolari veronesi, p. 37, No 100*; Ferraro,
C. p. monferrini, p. 1, No 1; Bernoni, C. p. veneziani, Puntata
V, No 1. In three of Nigra's versions and in Ferraro's the drink
is offered when the husband returns from hunting. The husband,
rendered suspicious by the look of the wine, or warned of his
danger, forces his wife to drink first. So in a northern ballad,
a mother who attempts to destroy her sons [step-sons] with a
brewage of this description is obliged to drink first, and bursts
with the poison: 'Eiturbyrlunar kv&aelig;&eth;i,' &Iacute;slenzk
Fornkv., II, 79, No 43 A; 'Fru Gundela,' Arwidsson, II, 92, No
89; 'Signelill aa hennes synir,' Bugge, p. 95, No xx, the last
half.</p>

<p>In one of the commonest Slavic ballads, a girl, who finds her
brother an obstacle to her desires, poisons him, at the
instigation and under the instruction of the man she fancies, or
of her own motion, by giving him a snake to eat, or the virus in
drink. The object of her passion, on being informed of what she
has done, casts her off, for fear of her doing the like to him.

<p>A version given by De Rada, Rapsodie d'un poema albanese, p.
78, canto x, resembles the Slavic, with a touch of the Italian. A
man incites a girl to poison her brother by pound ing the poison
out of a serpent's head and tail and mixing it with wine.</p>

<p>In a widely spread Romaic ballad, a mother poisons the bride
whom her son has just brought home, an orphan girl in some
versions, but in one a king's daughter wedding a king's son. The
cooks who are preparing the feast are made to cook for the bride
the heads of three snakes [nine snakes' heads, a three-headed
snake, winged snakes and two-headed adders]. In two Epirote
versions the poisoned girl bursts with the effects. "&#932;&#8048;

<p>An Italian mother-in-law undertakes to poison her son's wife
with a snake-potion. The wife, on her husband's return from the
chase, innocently proposes to share the drink with him. Her
husband no sooner has tasted than he falls dead. (Kaden,
Italien's Wunderhorn, p. 85).</p>

<p>Scott cites in his preface to 'Lord Randal' a passage from a
manuscript chronicle of England, in which the death of King John
is described as being brought about by administering to him the
venom of a toad (cf. the Magyar ballad). The symptoms swelling
and rupture are found in the Scandinavian and Epirote ballads
referred to above, besides those previously noticed (p. 155).
King John had asked a monk at the abbey of Swinshed how much a
loaf on the table was worth. The monk answered a half-penny. The
king said that if he could bring it about, such a loaf should be
worth twenty pence ere half a year. The monk thought he would
rather die than that this should come to pass. "And anon the monk
went unto his abbot and was shrived of him, and told the abbot
all that the king said, and prayed his abbot to assoil him, for
he would give the king such a wassail that all England should be
glad and joyful thereof. Then went the monk into a garden, and
found a toad therein, and took her up, and put her in a cup, and
filled it with good ale, and pricked her in every place, in the
cup, till the venom came out in every place, and brought it
before the king, and kneeled, and said: 'Sir, wassail: for never
in your life drank ye of such a cup.' 'Begin, monk,' said the
king: and the monk drank a great draught, and took the king the
cup, and the king also drank a great draught, and set down the
cup. The monk anon went to the firmary, and there died anon, on
whose soul God have mercy, amen. And five monks sing for his soul
es pecially, and shall while the abbey standeth. The king was
anon full evil at ease, and commanded to remove the table, and
asked after the monk; and men told him that he was dead, for his
womb was broke in sunder. When the king heard this tiding, he
commanded for to truss: but all it was for nought, for his belly
began to swell from the drink that he drank, that he died within
two days, the morrow after Saint Luke's day." Min strelsy, Hi,
287 f. The same story in Eulogium Historiarum, ed. Haydon, nr,
109 f.</p>
