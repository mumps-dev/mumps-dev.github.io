<p>Roxburghe, III, 14, 418; Douce, III, 121 b, London, by L. How,
an eighteenthcentury copy, <b>c</b> is signed T.R., and has no
printer's name.</p>

<p>Reprinted in Ritson's Robin Hood, 1795, II, 92, from <b>c</b>.
Evans, Old .Ballads, 1777, 1784, I, 156, agrees nearly with the
Aldermary garland.</p>

<p>Robin Hood's Chase is a sequel to Robin Hood and Queen
Katherine, and begins with a summary of that ballad. King Henry,
who has been gracious, and over-gracious, to the outlaw, has a
revulsion of feeling after Robin has left his presence, and sets
out in pursuit of him. When the king reaches Nottingham, Robin
leaves Sherwood for Yorkshire, whence he speeds successively to
Newcastle, Berwick, Carlisle, Lancaster, Chester, the king always
following him close. At Chester the happy idea occurs to him of
going back to London, as if to inquire whether he were wanted.
Queen Katherine informs Robin that the king has gone to Sherwood
to seek him, and Robin says he will return to the forest
immediately to learn the king's will. King Henry, coming home
weary and vexed, is told by his queen that Robin has been there
to seek him. A cunning knave, quoth the king. The queen
intercedes for Robin. This is a well-conceived ballad, and only
needs to be older.</p>

<p>Translated by A. Gr&uuml;n, p. 169, with omission of stanzas
1-7, 24.</p>
