<h3>219. The Gardener</h3>


<p>P. 212. Rev. S. Baring-Gould has pointed me to a printed copy
of this ballad, considerably corrupted, to be sure, but also
considerably older than the traditional versions. It is blended
at the beginning with a "Thyme" song, which itself is apt to be
mixed up with 'I sowed the seeds of love.' The second stanza is
from the "Thyme" song; the third is a traditional variation of a
stanza in 'I sowed the seeds of love.' (See the piece which
follows this.) The ballad begins with the fourth stanza, and the
fifth is corrupted by being transferred from the gardener to the
maid. Mr. Baring-Gould has lately taken down copies of the
"Thyme" song in the west of England. See one in Songs and Ballads
of the West, No 7, and the note thereto in the preface to Part IV
of that work, p. xv; also Campbell's Albyn's Anthology, I, 40,
Bruce and Stokoe, Northumbrian Minstrelsy, p. 90, and Chappell's
Popular Music, p. 521 f. Rev. S. Baring-Gould has given me two
copies, one from recitation, the other from "a broadside
published by Bebbington, Manchester, Brit. Mus., 1876. d., A
Collection of Songs and Broadsides, I, 264."</p>

<p>The piece which follows is little more than a variation of 'I
sow'd the seeds of love' (one of "three of the most popular songs
among the servant-maids of the present generation," says Mr.
Chappell: see a traditional version of the song, which was
originally composed by Mrs. Habergham towards the end of the
seventeenth century, in Popular Music, p. 522 f.). But the
choosing of a weed for a maid from garden-flowers is here, and is
not in the song. It will be observed that the maid chooses no
weed for the gardener, but dies of a thorn-prick, a trait which
is found in neither the song nor the ballad.</p>

<p>Taken down by Rev. S. Baring-Gould from the singing of Joseph
Paddon, Holcombe Burnell. Printed, with changes, in Baring-Gould
and Sheppard's Songs and Ballads of the West, No 107, Part IV, p.
50, 1891 here as sung.</p>
