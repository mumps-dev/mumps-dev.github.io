</ol>

<p>Christie, who gives <b>B</b>, "epitomized and slightly
changed," under the title 'Clerk Tamas and Fair Annie,'
Traditional Ballad Airs, II, 12, says that he can trace the
ballad, traditionally, far into the last century.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Lord Thomas goes a-hunting, and Lady Margaret rides
after him; when he sees her following, he orders his servants to
hunt her far from him, and they hunt her high and low. She comes
upon a tall young man, and begs 'relief' from him for a lady
wronged in love and chased from her 'country.' No relief is to be
had from him unless she will renounce all other men and be his
wife. After a time, Lady Margaret, sewing at her window, observes
a vagrant body, who turns out to be Lord Thomas, reduced to
beggary; he has been banished from his own country, and asks
relief. No relief from her; she would hang him were he within her
bower. Not so, says Lord Thomas; rather he would kill her lord
with his broadsword and carry her off. Not so, says Lady
Margaret, but you must come in and drink with me. She poisons
three bottles of wine, and pretends to be his taster. Lord Thomas
drinks away merrily, but soon feels the poison. I am wearied with
this drinking, he says. And so was I when you set your hounds at
me, she replies; but you shall be buried as if you were one of my
own.</p>

<p><b>B</b> has Clerk Tamas for Lord Thomas, and Fair Annie for
Lady Margaret. Tamas has loved Annie devotedly, but now hates her
and the lands she lives in. Annie goes to ask him to pity her; he
sees her coming, as he lies 'over his shot-window,' and orders
his men to hunt her to the sea. A captain, lying 'over his
ship-window,' sees Annie driven from the town, and offers to take
her in if she will forsake friends and lands for him. The story
goes on much as in <b>A</b>.</p>

<p><b>A</b> 8 is borrowed from 'The Douglas Tragedy,' see No 7,
<b>C</b> 9. <b>B</b> 14<sup>3,4</sup> is a commonplace, which, in
inferior traditional ballads, is often, as here, an out-of-place.
<b>B</b> 15, 16 is another commonplace, of the silly sort: see No
87, <b>B</b> 3, 4, <b>D</b> 4, 5, and Buchan's '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_261.html">Lady Isabel</a>,' 20,
21.</p>
