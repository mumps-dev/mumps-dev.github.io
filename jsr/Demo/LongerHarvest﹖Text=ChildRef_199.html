<p>The earliest copy of this ballad hitherto found is a broadside
of about 1790 (a hundred and fify years later than the event
celebrated), which Finlay combined with two others, derived from
recitation, for his edition (<b>A</b> <b>b</b>). <b>C</b>
<b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>, are not purely traditional texts,
and <b>A</b> <b>g</b> has borrowed some stanzas from <b>C</b>
<b>b</b>. <b>C</b> <b>b</b> is transcribed into the Campbell
Manuscripts, I, 184. Aytoun's edition, 1859, II, 270, is
compounded from <b>A</b> <b>a</b>, <b>A</b> <b>b</b>, with half a
dozen words changed, and it is not quite clear how the editor
means to be understood when he says, "the following, I have
reason to believe, is the original."</p>

<p>One summer day, Argyle, who has a quarrel with Airlie, sets
out to plunder the castle of that name. The lord of the place is
at the time with the king. Argyle (something in the style of
Captain Car) summons Lady Ogilvie to come down and kiss him; else
he will not leave a standing stone in Airlie. This she will not
do, for all his threat. Argyle demands of the lady where her
dowry is (as if it were tied up in a handkerchief). She gives no
precise information: it is east and west, up and down the
water-side. Sharp search is made, and the dowry is found in a
plum-tree (balm-tree, cherry-tree, palm-tree, <b>A</b> <b>a</b>,
<b>b</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>g</b>). Argyle lays or leads the
lady down somewhere while the plundering goes forward. She tells
him that no Campbell durst have taken in hand such a thing if her
lord had been at home. She has born seven (ten) sons, and is
expecting another; but had she as many more (a hundred more), she
would give them all to King Charles.</p>

<p>In <b>A</b> <b>d</b> 7 Lady Ogilvie asks the favor of Argyle
that he will take her to a high hill-top that she may not see the
burning of Airlie; the passage is of course corrupt. In <b>A</b>
<b>g</b> 7 she more sensibly asks that her face may not be turned
that way. In <b>C</b> <b>a</b> 5, 6, <b>b</b> 5, 6, the rational
request is made that she may be taken to some dark dowey
glen<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d199_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> to avoid the sight; but Argyle leads her "down to the
top of the town," and bids her look at the plundering, a; sets
her upon a bonnie knowe-tap, and bids her look at Airlie fa'ing,
<b>b</b>. <b>D</b> 7, 8, goes a step further. The lady asks that
she may be thrown over the castle-wall rather than see the
plundering; Argyle lifts her up 'sae rarely' and throws her over,
and she never saw it.</p>

<p>In <b>C</b> <b>a</b> 8 Argyle would have Lord Airlie informed
that one kiss from his lady would have saved all the plundering.
In <b>D</b> 5 he tells Lady Ogilvie that if she had surrendered
on the first demand there would have been no plundering; and this
assurance he repeats to 'Captain' Ogilvie, whom he meets on his
way home.</p>

<p><b>A</b> <b>b</b> 2, <b>D</b> 1, 2, represent Argyle to be
acting under the orders of Montrose, or in concert with him.</p>

<p>A piece in five or six stanzas which appears, with variations,
in Cromek's Remains, p. 195, Hogg's Jacobite Relics, II, 151,
Cunningham's Songs of Scotland, III, 218, under the caption of
'Young Airly' (the title of <b>C</b> <b>b</b> also in Cromek),
moves forward the burning of Airlie to "the 45;" not very
strangely (if there is anything traditional in these verses),
when we consider the prominence of the younger Lord Ogilvie and
his wife among the supporters of Charles Edward. (The first three
of Cromek's stanzas are transcribed into Campbell Manuscripts, I,
187.) No doubt the Charlie and Prince Charlie of some versions of
our ballad were understood by the reciters to be the Young
Chevalier.</p>

<p>The Committee of Estates, June 12, 1640, gave commission to
the Earl of Argyle to rise in arms against certain people, among
whom was the Earl of Airlie, as enemies to religion and unnatural
to their country, and to pursue them with fire and sword until
they should be brought to their duty or else utterly subdued and
rooted out. The Earl of Airlie had gone to England, fearing lest
he should be pressed to subscribe the Covenant, and had left his
house to the keeping of his eldest son, Lord Ogilvie. Montrose,
who had signed the commission as one of the Committee, but was
not inclined to so strenuous proceedings, invested Airlie, forced
a surrender, and put a garrison in the place to hold it for the
"public." Argyle did not interpret his commission in this mild
way. He took Airlie in hand in the beginning of July, and caused
both this house and that of Forthar, belonging to Lord Ogilvie,
to be pillaged, burned, and demolished. Thereafter he fell upon
the lands both of the proprietor and his tenantry, and carried
off or destroyed "their whole goods, gear, corns, cattle, horse,
nolt, sheep," and left nothing but bare bounds.</p>

<p>According to one writer, Lady Ogilvie was residing at Forthar,
and, being big with child, asked leave of Argyle to stay till she
was brought to bed; but this was not allowed, and she was put
out, though she knew not whither to go. By another account,
Argyle accused Montrose of having suffered the lady to
escape.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d199_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The ballad puts Lady Airlie in command of the house or castle,
but none of the family were there at the time it was sacked. She
is called Lady Margaret in <b>A</b> <b>b</b> 4, but her name was
Elizabeth. The earl, James, is called the great Sir John in
<b>C</b> <b>a</b> 9. <b>A</b> 10 and the like elsewhere are
applicable to the younger Lady Ogilvie in respect to the unborn
child. Chambers says that Lady Airlie had three children and Lady
Ogilvie but one, and "the poet must be wrong." "The poet,"
besides being inaccurate, does not tell the same story in all the
versions, and this inconsistency is again observable in
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_209.html">Geordie</a>,' <b>A</b> 9, <b>B</b> 18, <b>C</b> 8, etc.</p>

<p>'Gleyd Argyle' is "generally described as of mean stature,
with red hair and squinting eyes."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d199_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> His morals appear to some
disadvantage again in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_209.html">Geordie</a>,' <b>I</b> <b>a</b> 23.</p>
