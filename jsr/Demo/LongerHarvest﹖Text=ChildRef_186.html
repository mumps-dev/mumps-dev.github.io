<h3>Kinmont Willie</h3>

<li>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, I, 111, 1802; II, 32, 1833. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d18601.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>This ballad celebrates a bold and masterly exploit of Sir
Walter Scott of Brauxholm, laird of Buccleuch, which is narrated
as follows by a contemporary, Archbishop Spotiswood:<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d186_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"The Lord Scroop being then Warden of the West-Marches of
England, and the Laird of Bacleugh having the charge of
Lidisdale, they sent their deputies to keep a day of truce for
redress of some ordinary matters. The place of meeting was at the
Day holme of Kershop, where a small brook divideth England from
Scotland, and Lidisdale from Bawcastle. There met, as deputy for
the Laird of Bacleugh, Robert Scott of Hayninge, and for the Lord
Scroop, a gentleman within the West-Wardenry called Mr. Salkeld.
These two, after truce taken and proclaimed, as the custom was,
by sound of trumpet, met friendly, and, upon mutual redress of
such wrongs as were then complained of, parted in good terms,
each of them taking his way homewards. Meanwhile it happened one
William Armstrong, commonly called Will of Kin mouth, to be in
company with the Scottish deputy; against whom the English had a
quarrel for many wrongs he had committed, as he was indeed a
notorious thief. This man having taken his leave of the Scots
deputy, and riding down the river of Liddell on the Scottish
side, towards his own house, was pursued by the English that
espied him from the other side of the river, and after a chase of
three or four miles taken prisoner, and brought back to the
English deputy, who carried him away to the castle of Carlile.</p>

<p>"The Laird of Bacleugh complaining of the breach of truce
(which was always taken from the time of meeting unto the next
day at sun-rising) wrote to Mr. Salkeld and craved redress. He
excused himself by the absence of the Lord Scroop. Whereupon
Bacleugh sent to the Lord Scroop, and desired the prisoner might
be set at liberty, without any bond or condition, seeing he was
unlawfully taken. Scroop answered that he could do nothing in the
matter, it having so happened, without a direction from the queen
and council of England, considering the man was such a
malefactor. Bacleugh, loath to inform the king of what was done,
lest it might have bred some misliking betwixt the princes, dealt
with Mr. Bowes, the resident ambassador of England, for the
prisoner's liberty: who wrote very seriously to the Lord Scroop
in that business, advising him to set the man free*, and not to
bring the matter to a farther hearing. But no answer was
returned; the matter thereupon was imparted to the king, and the
queen of England solicited by letters to give direction for his
liberty; yet nothing was obtained. Which Bacleugh perceiving, and
apprehending both the king, and himself as the king's officer, to
be touched in honor, he resolved to work the prisoner's relief by
the best means he could.</p>

<p>"And upon intelligence that the castle of Carlile, wherein the
prisoner was kept, was surprisable, he employed some trusty
persons to take a view of the postern-gate, and measure the
height of the wall, which he meant to scale by ladders; and if
those failed, to break through the wall with some iron
instruments, and force the gates. This done so closely as he
could, he drew together some two hundred horse, assigning the
place of meeting at the tower of Morton,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d186_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> some ten miles from
Carlile, an hour before sun-set. With this company passing the
water of Esk about the falling, two hours before day he crossed
Eden beneath Carlile bridge (the water through the rain that had
fallen being thick), and came to the Sacery [Sacray], a plain
under the castle. There making a little halt at the side of a
small bourn which they call Cadage [Caday, Caldew], he caused
eighty of the company to light from their horses, and take the
ladders and other instruments which he had prepared with them. He
himself, accompanying them to the foot of the wall, caused the
ladders to be set to it; which proving too short, he gave order
to use the other instruments for opening the wall, nigh the
postern, and finding the business like to succeed, retired to the
rest whom he had left on horseback, for assuring those that
entered upon the castle against any eruption from the town. With
some little labor a breach was made for single men to enter, and
they who first went in brake open the postern for the rest. The
watchmen and some few the noise awaked made a little restraint,
but they were quickly repressed and taken Captive. After which
they passed to the chamber wherein the prisoner was kept, and
having brought him forth, sounded a trumpet, which was a signal
to them without that the enterprise was performed. My Lord Scroop
and Mr. Salkeld were both within the house, and to them the
prisoner cried a good-night. The captives taken in the first
encounter were brought to Bacleugh, who presently returned them
to their master, and would not suffer any spoil, or booty, as
they term it, to be carried away. He had straightly forbidden to
break open any door but that where the prisoner was kept, though
he might have made prey of all the goods within the castle and
taken the warden himself captive; for he would have it seen that
he did intend nothing but the reparation of his Majesty's honor.
By this time the prisoner was brought forth, the town had taken
the alarm, the drums were beating, the bells ringing, and a
beacon put on the top of the castle to give warning to the
country. Whereupon Bacleugh commanded those that entered the
castle, and the prisoner, to horse, and marching again by the
Sacery, made to the river at the Stony bank, on the other side
whereof certain were assembled to stop his passage; but he,
causing sound the trumpet, took the river, day being then broken;
and they choosing to give him way, he retired in order through
the Grahams of Esk (men at that time of great power and his
unfriends) and came back into Scottish ground two hours after
sun-rising, and so homewards. This fell out the thirteenth of
April, 1596." (History of the Church of Scotland, 1689, in the
second edition, 1666, p. 413 ff.)</p>

<p>Lord Scroope, on the morning after, wrote thus to the Privy
Council of England:</p>

<p>"Yesternight, in the dead time thereof, Walter Scott of
Hardinge and Walter Scott of Goldylands, the chief men about
Buclughe, accompanied with five hundred horsemen of Buclughe and
Kinmont's friends, did come, armed and appointed with gavlocks
and crows of iron, hand-picks, axes, and scaling-ladders, unto an
outward corner of the base-court of this castle, and to the
postern-door of the same, which they undermined speedily and
quickly, and made themselves possessors of the base-court, brake
into the chamber where Will of Kinmont was, carried him away,
and, in their discovery by the watch, left for dead two of the
watchmen, hurt a servant of mine, one of Kinmont's keepers, and
were issued again out of the postern before they were descried by
the watch of the inner ward, and ere resistance could be made.
The watch, as it should seem, by reason of the stormy night, were
either on sleep or gotten under some covert to defend themselves
from the violence of the weather, by means whereof the Scots
achieved their enterprise with less difficulty... If Buclughe
himself have been thereat in, person, the captain of this proud
attempt, as some of my servants tell me they heard his name
called upon (the truth whereof I shall shortly advertise) then I
humbly beseech that her Majesty may be pleased to send unto the
king to call for and effectually to press his delivery, that he
may receive punishment as her Majesty shall find that the quality
of his offence shall demerit."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d186_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Manuscript of the State Paper
Office, in Tytler's History, IX, 436.</p>

<p>Kinmont's rapacity made his very name proverbial. "Mas James
Melvine, in urging reasons against subscribing the act of
supremacy, in 1584, asks ironically, Who shall take order with
vice and wickedness? The court and bishops? As well as Martine
Elliot and Will of Kinmont with stealing upon the borders!"
Scott, Minstrelsy, 1833, II, 46.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when James was taking measures for bringing the
refractory ministers and citizens of Edinburgh into some proper
subjection, at the end of the year 1596, a report that Kinmont
Willie was to be let loose upon the city caused a lively
consternation; "but too well grounded," says Scott, "considering
what had happened in Stirling ten years before, when the Earl of
Angus, attended by Home, Buccleuch, and other border chieftains,
marched thither to remove the Earl of Arran from the king's
councils: the town was miserably pillaged by the borderers,
particularly by a party of Armstrongs, under this very Kinmont
Willie, who not only made prey of horses and cattle, but even of
the very iron grating of the windows." Minstrelsy, II, 45.</p>

<p>The ballad gives Buccleuch only forty men, and they are all of
the name of Scott except Sir Gilbert Elliot of Stobs: st. 16. A
partial list of the men who forced the castle was obtained by
Lord Scroope. It includes, as might be expected, not a few
Armstrongs, and among them the laird of Mangerton, Christy of
Barngleish (son of Gilnockie), and four sons of Kinmont Willie
(he had at least seven); two Elliots, but not Sir Gilbert; four
Bells.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d186_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Scott of Satchells, in his History of the Name of
Scott, 1688, makes Sir Gilbert Elliot one of the party, but may
have taken this name from the ballad. (Scott's Minstrelsy, 1833,
II, 43.) Dick of Dryhope, 24, 25, was an Armstrong.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d186_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The
ballad, again, after cutting down Buccleuch's men to thirty (st.
33) or forty (18, 19), assigns the very liberal garrison of a
thousand to the castle, 33; the ladders are long enough,
Buccleuch mounts the first,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d186_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> the castle is won, and Kinmont
Willie, in his irons, is borne down the ladder on Red
Rowan's<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d186_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> shoulders: all of which is as it should be in a
ballad. And so with the death of the fause Sakelde, though not a
life seems to have been lost in the whole course of the
affair.</p>

<p>"This ballad," says Scott, "is preserved by tradition in the
West Borders, but much mangled by reciters, so that some
conjectural emendations have been absolutely necessary to render
it intelligible. In particular, the Eden has been substituted for
the Esk [in 26<sup>2</sup>], the latter name being inconsistent
with geography." It is to be suspected that a great deal more
emendation was done than the mangling of reciters rendered
absolutely necessary. One would like, for example, to see stanzas
10-12 and 31 in their mangled condition.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d186_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>1. William Armstrong, called Will of Kinmonth, lived in Morton
Tower, a little above the Marchd ike-foot. He appears, says Mr.
R.B. Armstrong, to have been a son of Sandy, <i>alias</i> Ill
Will's Sandy. Haribee is the place of execution outside of
Carlisle. 3. The Liddel-rack is a ford in that river, which, for
a few miles before it empties into the Esk, is the boundary of
England and Scotland. 8. Branxholm, or Branksome, is three miles
southwest, and Stobs, 16, some four miles southeast, of Hawick.
19. Woodhouselee was a house on the Scottish border, a little
west of the junction of the Esk and Liddel, "belonging to
Buccleuch," says Scott.</p>
