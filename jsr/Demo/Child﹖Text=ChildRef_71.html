<h3>The Bent Sae Brown</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 30. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d07101.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>'The Bent sae Brown' combines the story of 'Clerk Saunders'
with that of another ballad, not found in an independent form in
English, but sufficiently common in Danish and Swedish; whence
the non-tragical conclusion, for the killing of a certain number
of brothers is not regarded as a very serious matter by the
heroine, whether in English or Norse. The introduction and
conclusion, and some incidental decorations, of the Scottish
ballad will not be found in the Norse, but are an outcome of the
invention and the piecing and shaping of that humble but
enterprising rhapsodist who has left his trail over so large a
part of Buchan's volumes.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d071_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A youth has passed the night with his love, either in her
bower or in a wood. When they are about to part in the morning,
she begs him to be on his guard against her seven brothers, on
his way through the wood and over the heath. He makes light of
the danger, and in the wood meets the seven brothers. They demand
how he comes to be there, and he feigns to have been out with his
hawk and hound, to have been coursing hares. No, they say, you
were with our sister last night, and asked no read of us. He
makes no denial; but her will was as good as his. They ask
whether he will fly or fight. He has no thought of flight, kills
all seven, and goes back to his love. She will not forsake him
for killing her brothers; nor would she, Danish <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, had he killed her father too.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d071_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
