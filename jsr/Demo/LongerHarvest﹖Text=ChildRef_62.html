<p>The fragment <b>D</b>, printed in 1769, antedates the
committing to writing of any of the other versions. <b>E</b> was
taken down as early as 1783. <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are from the
beginning of this century. <b>A</b> was obtained "chiefly from
the recitation of an old woman," but we are not informed who
supplied the rest. Herd's fragment, <b>D</b>, furnished stanzas
2-6, 12, 17, 19. A doubt may be hazarded whether stanzas 8-10
came from the old woman. <b>I</b> is a combination of three
recited versions, and <b>J</b>, perhaps a transcript of a
stall-copy, is, like many of Buchan's ballads, extended to twice
the length of genuine versions by tedious, sometimes nauseous,
amplification and interpolation.</p>

<p>'Lady Jane,' Jamieson's Popular Ballads, II, 73, is a
combination of <b>B</b> and <b>E</b>, with a good many bad verses
of Jamieson's own. A version in Motherwell's Manuscript, p. 477,
"from the recitation of an old maid-servant of Mr. Alexander, of
Southbar," was, as would be inferred from a memorandum at the end
of the transcript, derived from a printed book, and is in fact an
imperfect recollection of this compounded ballad of
Jamieson's.</p>

<p>Grundtvig has attempted a reconstitution of the ballad from
versions <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,
Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, <b>V</b>, 42.</p>

<p>Annie [Helen, <b>B</b>, Ellen, <b>G</b>, Jane, <b>E</b>] was
stolen from home in her childhood, <b>A</b> 15, <b>B</b> 23,
<b>C</b> 31, <b>E</b> 9, <b>F</b> 25, <b>I</b> 38, <b>J</b> 50,
51, by a knight from over sea, to whom she has borne seven sons,
out of wedlock. Her consort bids her prepare to welcome a bride,
with whom he shall get gowd and gear; with her he got none. But
she must look like a maid, comb down her yellow locks, braid her
hair.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d062_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Annie meekly assents, for love, she says, in <b>C</b>
12; in <b>I</b> 4, <b>J</b> 15, the welcoming goes against her
heart; in <b>F</b> 9 she is told that she is to do it; in
<b>H</b> 2 she says the welcome will have to come from him. Annie
receives the bride and her train and serves the tables,
suppressing her tears and drinking water to keep her cheek from
paling. She passes for servant or housekeeper, and in <b>I</b>
23, <b>J</b> 25, uses the word 'master,' not to anger the bride;
in <b>C</b> 17 she calls her lord brother, and the knight calls
her sister in <b>C</b> 18 and (inconsistently) in <b>J</b> 38.
What 'n a lady's that? asks the bride, <b>E</b> 9, <b>J</b> 37,
and what means all these bonny boys that follow at her heel?
<b>J</b> 37.</p>

<p>When the married pair have gone to their bed-chamber, Annie,
in a room near by, bewails her sad lot in song; to the harp or
her virginals, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>I</b>. The bride
hears the lament: it is that of a woman who will go mad ere day,
<b>B</b> 20, <b>C</b> 26, <b>J</b> 44, 48. The bride goes to Fair
Annie's chamber, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>? to see what gars her greet,
inquires her parentage, and discovers that they are sisters; or
learns this fact from the song itself, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>; or
recognizes her sister's voice, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>. King
Henry was their father, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>; King
Easter, <b>C</b>;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d062_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> the Earl of Wemyss, of Richmond, <b>A</b>,
<b>E</b>. Queen Easter was their mother, <b>F</b>; Queen
Catherine, Elinor [Orvis], <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>. The bride, who had
come with many well-loaded ships, gives all or most of them to
her sister, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, and
goes virgin home, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>,
<b>J</b>; expecting, as <b>B</b>, <b>J</b> add, to encounter
derision for going away wife and coming back maid.</p>

<p>In <b>C</b> 27 the bride suspects that the woman who wails so
madly is a leman, and urges her husband to get up and pack her
down the stairs, though the woods were ne'er so wild. He refuses.
A similar scene is elsewhere put earlier, during the bridal
entertainment, <b>I</b> 29, 30, <b>J</b> 40: see also <b>G</b> 2,
3, which are partly explained by these passages, and partly by
<b>J</b> 36. There are other variations in the story, and some
additional particulars in one or another version: none of these,
however, seem to belong to the original ballad. The bride, as
soon as she sees Annie, is struck with the resemblance to her
lost sister, <b>A</b> 14, <b>E</b> 9, <b>J</b> 29. The bridegroom
repents, and rejects the woman he has married, <b>E</b> 19,
<b>F</b> 30, <b>J</b> 49. The bridegroom confiscates without
ceremony, as tocher for Annie, six of the seven ships which the
bride had brought with her, <b>E</b>, <b>J</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d062_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The name Lord Thomas in <b>A</b> was probably suggested by
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_73.html">Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</a>.'</p>

<p>A Danish ballad of Fair Annie has been known to the English
for fourscore years through Jamieson's translation. The
Scandinavian versions are the following.</p>

<p><b>Danish</b>. 'Skj&ouml;n Anna,' Grundtvig, No 258, V, 13,
eight versions: <b>A</b>, 39 four-line stanzas, <b>B</b>, 34 sts,
<b>C</b>, 45 sts, from manuscripts of the sixteenth century;
<b>D</b>, 48 sts, <b>E</b>, 41 sts, <b>G</b>, 32 sts, from
seventeenth-century manuscripts; <b>F</b>, 41 sts, from
broadsides or stall-copies, the earliest dated 1648, from Peder
Syv, 1695, and from copies lately taken down which were derived
from printed texts; <b>H</b>, 43 sts, a version recently obtained
from tradition in Norway. Of these, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>G</b> are independent texts; <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b> are
derived from some copy of <b>C</b>, or from a version closely
akin to <b>C</b>; <b>H</b> is essentially the broadside copy
<b>F</b>, but has one stanza of its own. <b>F</b>, Syv, No 17,
Danske Viser, IV, 59, No 177, the form through which the Danish
ballad has been made known by English translations, is
unfortunately an Impure and sophisticated text.</p>

<p><b>Swedish</b>. <b>A</b>, 'Sk&ouml;n Anna,' 19 sts, Arwidsson,
I, 291, No 42; <b>B</b>, Afzelius, I, 24, No 5, 32 sts; <b>C</b>,
Wigstr&ouml;m, Folkdiktning, I, 57, No 28, 37 sts. <b>C</b>
follows in the main Danish <b>F</b>, but with a variation in st.
31 which is of much importance if traditional. A translation of
Danish <b>F</b> has long circulated in Sweden as a broadside:
see, besides Grundtvig, Bergstr&ouml;m's Afzelius, II, 30.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian story will, for more brevity, be collected
principally from Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and some
variations of the other copies be added.</p>

<p>Fair Annie [Anneck, Annecke, <b>A</b>], a king's daughter, is
stolen in her early years, and sold to a man of rank, who is in
fact heir to a crown. They have seven sons in eight [seven]
years, and he then becomes king. Fair Annie begs the queen-mother
to intercede with her son now to make her a lawful wife and
legitimate his children. The mother loves Annie, and heartily
desires that he may. The son refuses; she has great virtues, but
he does not know Annie's friends [her forbears, lineage, Danish
<b>F</b>, Swedish <b>C</b>]. He makes suit for a king's daughter
in a distant land. Annie's heart all but breaks when the bride
comes. The young king asks the bride what gift she will give his
<i>amie</i>, <b>A</b>. I will give her my old shoes, she says,
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>. She must give something else if she
would get his good will. Then she will give Annie seven mills
that lie far over the Rhine and grind nought but cinnamon,
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>. Annie is now asked what gift she
will make the bride. I will give her you, whom I can so ill
spare, answers Annie. No, that is not enough; she must give
another gift to win the bride's good will. I will give her the
seven sons I have borne, says Annie. Neither is that enough; she
must give the bride her gold brooch. This Annie will not
surrender, for it was his morning-gift. Annie now asks her lord
to let her go into the bride-house [hall] and see the bride. He
refuses emphatically, but his kind mother says, Yes; she will
even go with Annie, though it should cost her her life. Annie
goes to the bride-house, preceded by her seven sons, who wear her
father's color. She pours wine for the bride, with many tears,
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>. The bride asks who this fair woman is that
weeps so sore. And who are these that wear her father's
color?<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d062_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It is the king's sister's daughter, from a foreign
land, <b>C</b>-<b>F</b>, <b>H</b>; his sister, Danish <b>A</b>,
Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. "It is not your sister's daughter,"
says the bride; "that I plainly see. I fear it is your leman,"
<b>C</b> 34, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>. The king now avows the truth. It
is Fair Annie, my leman, Danish <b>A</b> 33, Swedish <b>A</b> 16
(which adds, "Her father I never knew"); she was stolen from a
foreign land in her young days, and has been with me seven years,
Danish <b>B</b> 31; she was sold to me from a foreign land; these
are her seven sons, they will be bastards now, and that is the
cause of her grief, <b>C</b> 35, 36, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>; these
are my seven sons, Fair Annie is their mother, Swedish <b>B</b>
27. I had a sister, says the bride; she was stolen from my
father's land; Fair Annie was her name, this must be she,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d062_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> she
shall keep her husband. The king sends tbe new-come bride home
with due ceremony, and keeps Fair Annie for his heart's deligbt,
<b>C</b> 37-44, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>.</p>

<p>In Danish <b>G</b> 7, the king gives as a reason for not
espousing Fair Annie that she has no fortune, ingen rente, which
is tbe objection to her in English <b>A</b> 1, <b>C</b> 2, etc.
The oldest [youngest] son of Fair Annie attends his mother's
sister to her father's land in Swedish <b>C</b>, Danish <b>F</b>,
<b>K</b>, as in English <b>J</b> 54. The king promises his
brother to Annie's sister in Danish <b>A</b> 39 (compare also
Swedish <b>B</b> 33). In English <b>I</b> 26, <b>J</b> 30, the
bride thinks her brother would be a good match for Annie.</p>

<p>Swedish <b>C</b>, though in itself of little authority, has an
advantage over the Danish copies and Swedish <b>B</b> in making
Annie refuse to part with the gold brooch, not because it was a
morning-gift, but because she had had it ever since she was a
child and was kidnapped from her father's court; and again in
making this brooch the means of her recognition as sister by the
bride.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian ballad is regarded by Grundtvig as
transmitted from Low German. The rhymes are frequently not after
the Danish manner (see Grundtvig, V, 46, 7), and the heroine's
name has a Low German look.</p>

<p>Dutch and German versions, all ill enough preserved, are:</p>

<p><b>Dutch</b>. <b>A</b>. 'Schon Adelheid,' 22 four-line
stanzas, Hoffmann, Niederl&auml;ndische Volkslieder, 2d ed.,
1856, p. 46, No 11, 'Mooi Aeltje en Koning Alewijn,' Willems, p.
177, No 70; from Den Italiaenschen Quacksalver, Amsterdam, 1708.
<b>B</b>. 'Madel,' 15 stanzas, Snellaert, Oude en nieuwe Liedjes,
p. 70, No 65, 2d ed., 1864.</p>

<p><b>German</b>. <b>A</b>. Longard, Altrheinl&auml;ndische
M&auml;hrlein und Liedlein, 1843, p. 23, No 12; Wilhelm von
Zuccalmaglio, Deutsche Volkslieder, 1840, p. 74, No 32, =
Mittler, No 333: 21 four-line stanzas. <b>B</b>. Montanus
(Vincenz von Zuccalmaglio), Die deutschen Volksfeste, 1854, p.
46, 17 stanzas, apparently rewritten. According to Dutch <b>A</b>
Aaltje, Ethel, Adeline, a king's daughter, is stolen, and sold
for a great sum to King Alewijn. She asks the king's mother, who
is quite disposed to have her for a daughter, when her son will
marry her, and the mother asks her son how long Maid Aaltje is to
live under disgrace. The king objects that Aaltje is a
<i>vondeling</i>, a waif-woman (English <b>C</b> 2, <b>I</b> 2);
Heaven only knows her friends and kin. He adds that he was over
the Rhine yesterday, and that Aaltje will break her heart with
sorrow. The young woman asks the mother's permission to go to the
bride's house, and is told to go in good style, her seven sons
before her and fourteen ladies-in-waiting behind. The king meets
Aaltje half-way, and says, If you are going to the bride's house,
what gift do you mean to make the bride? The bride will have
enough, she replies; I will give her my old stockings and shoes.
She must give something better to gain her friendship. Then
Aaltje will give her "seven sons of yours and mine" to serve her.
She will have your seven sons, says the king, but you must give
her your brooch.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d062_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> No, that you will not get, says Aaltje.
There were two at my father's court; my sister and I each had
one. Are you then of royal birth? says the king. Had you told me
that, I would have married <i>you</i>. When Aaltje appears at the
bride's house, they offer her to drink, and many a tear she drops
in the cup. Who is this woman that weeps so piteously? asks the
bride. These are some of our nieces and nephews, who have come
from foreign parts to bring you presents, is the king's answer.
Nieces and nephews! Says the bride; it is Maid Aaltje, my
youngest sister. She takes the crown from her head: Take it,
Aaltje, and keep your husband. Saddle my horse. I came in honor,
I must go back in shame. (Cf. English <b>B</b> 26, <b>I</b>
45.)</p>

<p><b>B</b>. Madel (M'Adel), the oldest of a king's two
daughters, is stolen by a king's son to be his leman, and taken
to a far country. They have seven sons, and he forsakes her and
betroths himself to her sister. He asks his mother what present
she will make his bride; she has seven mills which she will give
her. Madel, asked in like manner, replies, My old stockings and
shoes. Madel asks the queen-mother if she may go to the bridal,
for the king is to marry, and is answered as in <b>A</b>. When
she comes to the bride-loft they pour wine for her, and she drops
tears in the cup. The bride asks who this is, and the king
replies, One of my nieces from a far country, who came to do me
honor, but only puts me to shame. You are not telling me the
truth, says the bride. The king owns that it is Madel, his leman,
with her seven sons. The bride recognizes a brooch<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d062_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> stiff
with gold and silk. "There are but two such in all Flanders; I
and my sister each had one." She tears the crown from her own
head and puts it on her sister, saying, King, marry her in my
place. The brooch is distinctly made the means of identification,
which it by all likelihood was originally in all the Scandinavian
ballads, though only Swedish <b>C</b> has retained (or restored)
this feature.</p>

<p>The German ballad resembles Dutch <b>A</b> closely. The
queen-mother gives Adelheid permission to go to the wedding, and
her seven sons must walk before her. At the feast the king offers
her to drink; she cannot drink for the grief he has caused her.
The bride sees her weeping, and orders food and drink to be
offered her (cf. English <b>J</b> 36), but she cannot touch them.
The king pretends that she is one of his nieces who has lived with
him seven years [is fatigued by her journey, <b>B</b>]. The bride
exclaims, I see the fore-span (by your fore-span, <b>A</b>), you
are driving a pair! In <b>A</b> she asks the fair woman's name and
country. Her country is over the Rhine, and thence she had been
stolen. "Then you must be my sister," declares the bride somewhat
hastily, gives up her seat and the crown, puts her ring on
Adelheid's finger, and bids the news be sent to father and
mother.</p>

<p>The lyric beauty of the Scottish version of this ballad,
especially conspicuous in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, has been
appreciatingly remarked by Grundtvig.</p>

<p>But Fair Annie's fortunes have not only been charmingly sung,
as here; they have also been exquisitely <i>told</i> in a
favorite lay of Marie de France, 'Le Lai del Freisne.' This tale,
of Breton origin, is three hundred years older than any
manuscript of the ballad. Comparison will, however, quickly show
that it is not the source either of the English or of the Low
German and Scandinavian balld. The tale and the ballads have a
common source, which lies further back, and too far for us to
find.</p>

<p>The story of the lay is this.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d062_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> There were two knights in
Brittany, living on contiguous estates, and both married. The
lady of one of the two gave birth to two boys, and the father
sent information of the event to his neighbor and friend. His
friend's wife was a scoffing, envious woman, "judging always for
the worse," and said,</p>

<p>In the course of the same year the woman that had made this
hateful insinuation was brought to bed of twin girls. To save her
reputation she was ready even to put one of them to death, but a
favorite damsel in her house suggested a better way out of her
perplexity, and that was to leave one of the children at the door
of a convent. The child, wrapped in a rich pall that had been
brought from Constantinople, with a jewelled ring bound to its
arm to show that it was well born, was taken away in the night to
a considerable distance, and was laid between the branches of a
great ash-tree in front of a nunnery. In the morning it was
discovered by the porter, who told his adventure to the abbess;
and the abbess, having inspected the foundling, resolved to bring
it up under the style of her niece. The girl, who received the
name La Freisne from the tree in which she had been found, turned
out a marvel of beauty and of all good qualities. A gentleman of
the vicinity fell in love with her, and made large gifts to the
monastery to constitute himself a lay-brother, and so have access
to her without exciting suspicion. He obtained her love, and in
the end induced her to fly with him to his ch&acirc;teau. This
she did with sufficient deliberation to take with her the robe
and ring which were the tokens of her birth; for the abbess had
told her how she had been found in the ash, and had committed
these objects to her care. She lived a good while with the knight
as his mistress, and made herself loved by everybody; but his
retainers had repeatedly remonstrated with him for not providing
himself with a lawful successor, and at last forced him to marry
the daughter and heiress of a gentleman near by. On the day of
the nuptials La Freisne let no sign of grief or anger escape her,
but devoted herself to the bride so amiably as even to win over
the mother, who had accompanied her daughter, and had at first
felt much uneasiness at the presence of a possible rival. Finding
the marriage bed not decked with sufficient elegance, La Freisne
took from a trunk the precious pall from Constantinople, and threw
it on for a coverlet. When the bride's mother was about to put
her daughter to bed, this robe was of course the first object
that met her eyes. Her heart quaked. She sent for the
chamberlain, and asked where the cloth came from. The chamberlain
explained that "the damsel" had put it on to improve the
appearance of the bed. The damsel was summoned, and told what she
knew: the abbess who brought her up had given her the robe, and
with it a ring, and charged her to take good care of them. A
sight of the ring was asked; the lady cried, You are my daughter,
and fainted. When she recovered she sent for her husband and
confessed everything. The husband was only too happy to find that
the damsel tant pruz &egrave; sage &egrave; bele was his
daughter. The story was repeated to La Freisne, and then to the
knight and to the archbishop who had performed the marriage
ceremony. The marriage was dissolved the next day, and La Freisne
formally espoused by the knight, who received with her half her
father's heritage. The sister went home and made a rich
marriage.</p>

<p>The common ground-work of the ballads and the lay is, that a
man who has formed an irregular union with a woman whose family
he does not know undertakes matrimony with another person, who is
discovered on the day of the nuptials to be sister to his leman.
A jewel in the possession of the latter, by itself or together
with another token, reveals and proves the kinship in the lay and
in the Scandinavian-German ballad, but there is no trace of such
an instrumentality in the Scottish.</p>

<p>Single features, or even several features, of the story of
Fair Annie or of La Freisne occur in many other ballads and
tales, but there is no occasion to go into these resemblances
here. A Norse ballad has almost every point in 'Fair Annie' but
the sisterly relation of leman and bride: see 'Slegfred og Brud,'
Grundtvig, No 255, and '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_253.html">Thomas o Yonderdale</a>,' an apocryphal
ballad of Buchan's, further on. Bare mention may be made of the
beautiful Spanish romance 'Las dos Hermanas,' found also in
Portuguese, in which the queen of a Moor or Turk discovers her
sister in a slave who has been presented to her, or captured at
her request.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d062_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
