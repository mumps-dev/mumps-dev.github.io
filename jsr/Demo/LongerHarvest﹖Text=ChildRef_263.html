<h3>The New-Slain Knight</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'The New-Slain Knight,' Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 197.
<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d26301.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>A knight (who twaddles in the first person at the beginning)
finds a maid sleeping under a hedge, wakes her, and tells her
that he has seen a dead man in her father's garden. She asks
about the dead man's hawk, hound, sword. His hawk and hound were
gone, his horse was tied to a tree, a bloody sword lay under his
head. She asks about his clothes, and receives a description,
with the addition that his hair was bonny and new combed. 'I
combed it late yesterday!' says the lady. 'Who now will shoe my
foot, and glove my hand, and father my bairn?' The knight offers
himself for all these, but the lady will commit herself only to
Heaven. The knight, after knacking his fingers quite
superfluously, unmasks; he has only been making a trial of her
truth.</p>

<p>A large part of this piece is imitated or taken outright from
very well known ballads (as has already been pointed out by the
editor of the Ballad Minstrelsy of Scotland, 1871, p. 345): 5-8
from '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_88.html">Young Johnstone</a>,' No 88; 10, 11 from '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_76.html">The Lass of Roch Royal</a>,'
No 76 (see particularly <b>E</b> 1-4, and compare No 66,
<b>A</b> 24, etc.); for 13<sup>1,2</sup> see No 91, <b>B</b>
5<sup>1</sup>, 6<sup>1</sup>, 7<sup>1</sup>, <b>D</b>
7<sup>1,2</sup>, No 257, <b>A</b> 7.</p>

<p>Grundtvig notes that this piece is of the same description as
the Danish 'Troskabsproven,' Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, IV, 553,
No 252, one version of which is translated by Prior, III, 289, No
146. Naturally, the fidelity of maid or wife is celebrated in the
ballads of every tongue and people. This particular ballad, so
far as it is original, is of very ordinary quality. The ninth
stanza is pretty, but not quite artless.</p>

294, No 46.</p>
