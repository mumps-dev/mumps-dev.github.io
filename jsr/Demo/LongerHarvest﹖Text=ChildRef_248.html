<h3>The Grey Cock,<br/>
or,<br/>
Saw You My Father</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li><ol type="a">
<li>'The Grey Cock,' Herd's Ancient and Modern Scots Songs, 1769,
p. 324; Herd's Manuscripts, 1,4; Herd's Ancient and Modern
Scottish Songs, 1776, II, 208.</li>
<li>'Saw you my father?' Chappell's Popular Music, p. 731.</li>
</ol> <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d24801.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Stanzas 1, 4, 6, 7, are printed in Herd, 1769; the three
others are among the "Additions to songs in the former volume"
[of 1769], at the beginning of the first volume of the
Manuscript; the whole is given in Herd, 1776.</p>

<p>Repeated from Herd, 1776 (with a change or two) in Pinkerton's
Select Scotish Ballads II, 155, 1783, and in Johnson's Museum, p.
77, No 76, 1787, 'O saw ye my father?' Stenhouse had not found
the verses in any collection prior to that of Herd, but asserts
that the song had been "a great favorite in Scotland for a long
time past" (1820, Museum, ed. 1853, IV, 81).</p>

<p>"This song," says Chappell, "is printed on broadsides, with
the tune, and in Vocal Music, or the Songster's Companion, II,
36, second edition, 1772. This collection was printed by Robert
Horsfield, in Ludgate Street, and probably the words and music
will also be found in the first edition, which I have not seen."
The words, he adds, are in several "Songsters."</p>

<p>Three stanzas from recitation, wrongly attached to '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_43.html">The Broomfield Hill</a>,'
No 43, <b>E</b>, have been given at p. 399 of
the first volume of this collection. Much of the ballad has been
adopted into '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_255.html">Willie's Fatal Visit</a>,' Buchan's Ballads of the
North of Scotland, II, 259, the two concluding stanzas with
little change. These two stanzas are given by a
correspondent<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d248_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> of Notes and Queries, First Series, XII, 227,
as heard by him in the nursery about 1787. They have been made
the kernel of a song by Allan Cunningham, impudently put forward
as "the precious relique of the original," Cromek, Remains of
Nithsdale and Galloway Song, 1810, p. 72.</p>

<p>The injunction to the cock is found in 'The Swain's Resolve,'
Lyle's Ancient Ballads and Songs, 1827, p. 142:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>She cries to the cock, saying, Thou must not crow<br/>
Until that the day be worn,<br/>
And thy wings shall be made of the silvery gray,<br/>
And thy voice of the silver horn.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>It is also cited in Graves's Irish Songs and Ballads, London,
188?. 249, No 50, as occurring "in a ballad descriptive of the
visit of a lover's ghost to his betrothed," in which the woman,
to protract the interview, says:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'O my pretty cock, O my handsome cock,<br/>
I pray you do not crow before day,<br/>
And your comb shall be made of the very beaten gold,<br/>
And your wings of the silver so gray.'</td></tr>

</table>

<p>The cock is remiss or unfaithful, again, in a little ballad
picked up by Burns in Nithsdale, 'A Waukrife Minnie,' Cromek,
Select Scotish Songs, 1810, II, 116 (of which another version is
furnished by Lyle, p. 155, 'The Wakerife Mammy'):</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>O weary fa the waukrife cock,<br/>
And the foumart lay his crawin!<br/>
He waukend the auld wife frae her sleep<br/>
A wee blink or the dawin.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>The first stanza of 'The Grey Cock' seems to have been
suggested by '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_77.html">Sweet William's Ghost</a>' (of which the Irish ballad
noted by Graves may have been a variety), as again is the case in
Buchan's 'James Herries.' The fantastic reward promised the cock
in stanza 6 is an imitation, or a corruption, of the bribe to the
parrot in No 4, <b>D</b> 23, <b>E</b> 15, <b>F</b> 10, or in No
68, <b>A</b> 10, <b>B</b> 13, <b>C</b> 14, etc.</p>

<p>Of the same general description is 'Le Chant de l'Alouette,'
Victor Smith, Chansons de Velay, etc., Romania, VII, 56 (see
further note 6 of Smith); 'Le Rendez-vous,' M&eacute;lusine, I,
285 ff., Rolland, Recueil, etc., IV, 43, No 196. Again, 'La
Rondinella,' Kopisch, Agrumi, p. 80, 1837; 'La Visita,' Wolf,
Volkslieder aus Venetien, p. 8; 'La Rondine importuna,' Ferraro,
C. p. monferrini, p. 75, No 54; 'Il Furto amoroso ' Gianandrea,
C. p. marchigiani, p. 274; 'La Rondinella,' Archivio, VII, 401,
No 6. The treacherous or troublesome bird is in French the lark,
in one case the cock; in Italian the swallow.</p>

<p>This piece is a variety of the <i>aube</i> (concerning which
species see Jeanroy, Les Origines de la Po&eacute;sie lyrique en
France, the third chapter), but is none the less quite modern.</p>
