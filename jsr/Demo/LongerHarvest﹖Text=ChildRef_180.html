<h3>King James and Brown</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Kinge James and Browne,' Percy Manuscript, p. 58;
Hales and Furnivall, I, 185. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d18001.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>As the minstrel is walking by himself, he hears a young prince
lamenting. The prince says to him, Yonder comes a Scot who will
do me wrong. Douglas comes with armed men, who beset the king
with swords and spears. Are you lords of Scotland, come for
council, asks the king, or are you traitors, come for my blood?
They say that they are traitors, come for his blood. Fie on you,
false Scots! exclaims the king; you have slain my grandfather,
caused my mother to flee, and hanged my father. [About nine
stanzas are lost here.] Douglas offers Brown his daughter in
marriage to betray the king; Brown will never be a traitor.
Douglas is making off fast, but Brown takes him prisoner and
conducts him to the king. Douglas prays for pardon. The king
replies that Douglas has sought to kill him ever since he was
born. Douglas swears to be a true subject if pardoned. The king
pardons him freely, and all traitors in Scotland, great and
small. Douglas mutters to himself (we may suppose), If I live a
twelvemonth you shall die, and I will burn Edinburgh to-morrow.
This irredeemable traitor hies to Edinburgh with his men, but the
people shut the gates against him. Brown is always where he is
wanted, and takes Douglas prisoner again; the report that Douglas
is secured goes to the king, who demands his taker to be brought
into his presence, and promises him a thousand pound a year. So
they call Brown; we may imagine that the distance is no greater
than Holy rood. How often hast thou fought for me, Brown? asks
James. Brown's first service was in Edinburgh; had he not stood
stoutly there, James had never been king. The second was his
killing the sheriff of Carlisle's son, who was on the point of
slaying his Grace. The third was when he killed the Bishop of St.
Andrews, who had undertaken to poison the king. James had already
made the faithful Englishman (for such he is) knight; now he
makes him an earl, with professions of fidelity to the English
queen.</p>

<p>This third service of Brown is the subject of a poem by
William Elderton, here given in an appendix. The bishop is about
to give the king (then a child) a poisoned posset. The lady nurse
calls for aid. Brown, an Englishman, hears, goes to help, meets
the bishop hurrying off with the posset in his hand, and forces
him to drink it, though the bishop makes him handsome offers not
to interfere. The venom works swiftly, the bishop's belly bursts.
The king knights Brown, and gives him lands and livings.</p>

<p>John Hamilton, Archbishop of St. Andrews, must be the person
whom Brown slays in the ballad for an attempt to poison the young
king. He was, however, hanged by his political enemies, April 7,
1571. This prelate was credited with being an accomplice to the
murder of Darnley and to that of the Regent Murray. His elder
brother was heir to the throne after the progeny of Mary Stuart,
and both of these persons were more or less in the way. Mary
Stuart's son was a step on which the Hamiltons must "fall down or
else oerleap," and the archbishop is said to have sneered at the
Duke of Chatelheraut for letting an infant live between him and
the throne. A report that the archbishop had undertaken to poison
this infant would readily be believed. Sir William Drury thought
it worth his while to write to Cecil that Queen Mary had done the
same before her son was a year old.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d180_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Of Browne's two previous performances, his standing stoutly
for the king at Edinburgh, st. 26, and his killing the son of the
sheriff of Carlisle, st. 27, we are permitted to know only that,
since these preceded the killing of the bishop, they occurred at
some time before James was five years old. The epoch of the
adventure with Douglas, which is the principal subject of the
ballad, could be determined beyond question if we could ascertain
when Brown was made an earl. It falls after the murder of the
Regent Lennox, 8 1, that is, later than September, 1571, and the
king is old enough to know something of the unhappy occurrences
in his family, to forget and forgive, and to make knights and
earls. There are correspondences between the ballad and the
proceedings by which the Earl of Morton, after his resignation of
the regency, obtained possession of the young king's person and
virtually reestablished himself in his former power. This was in
April, 1578, when James was not quite twelve years old. Morton
was living at Lochleven "for policie, devysing the situation of a
fayre gardene with allayis, to remove all suspicion of his
consavit treason." James was in the keeping of Alexander Erskine,
his guardian, at Stirling Castle, of which Erskine was governor;
and the young Earl of Mar, nephew of the governor, was residing
there. This young man became persuaded, perhaps through Morton's
representations, that he himself was entitled to the custody of
the castle, and incidentally of the king. Early in the morning of
the 26th of April, before the garrison were astir, Mar (who was
risen under pretence of a hunting-party), supported by two Abbot
Erskines, his uncles, and a retinue of his own, demanded the
castle-keys of the governor. An affray followed, in which a son
of Alexander Erskine lost his life. The young king, wakened by
the noise, rushed in terror from his chamber, tearing his hair.
Mar overpowered resistance and seized the keys. Shortly after
this, he and his uncle the governor came to terms at the instance
of the king, Mar retaining Stirling Castle and the wardenship of
the king, and the uncle being made keeper of the castle of
Edinburgh. Morton was received into Stirling Castle, and resumed
his sway. All this did not pass without opposition. The citizens
of Edinburgh rose in arms against Morton (cf. sts 21, 22), and
large forces collected from other parts of the country for the
liberation of the king. A civil war was imminent, and was
avoided, it would seem, chiefly through the influence of the
English minister, Bowes, who offered himself as peacemaker, in
the name of his queen (cf. sts 31, 32).<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d180_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The Douglas of this ballad is clearly William Douglas of
Lochleven, who joined Mar at Stirling as Morton's intermediary.
He was afterwards engaged in the Raid of Ruthven.</p>

<p>It may be added that Robert Brown, a servant of the king's,
played a very humble part, for the defence of his master, in the
Gowrie Conspiracy, but that was nearly twenty years after Andrew
Brown was celebrated by Elderton, and when James was no young
prince, but in his thirty-fifth year.</p>
