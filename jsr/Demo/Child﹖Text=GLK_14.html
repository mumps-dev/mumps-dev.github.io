<h3>14. Babylon;<br/>
or,<br/>
The Bonnie Banks o Fordie</h3>

<p>This ballad, with additional circumstances, is familiar to all
branches of the Scandinavian race. The Danish 'Herr Truels'
Daughters' (Grundtvig-Olrik, No. 338) may serve as a specimen:
&mdash; Herr Truels' three daughters oversleep their matins one
morning, and are roused by their mother. If we have overslept our
matins, they say, we will make up at high mass. They set out for
church, and in a wood fall in with three robbers, who say:</p>

<p>'Whether will ye be three robbers' wives,<br/>
Or will ye rather lose your lives?'</p>

<p>Much rather death, say they. The two elder sisters submitted
to their fate without a word; the third made a hard resistance.
With her last breath she adjured the robbers to seek a lodging at
Herr Truels' that night. This they did. They drank so long that
they drank Herr Truels to bed. Then they asked his wife to
promise herself to all three. First, she said, she must look into
their bags. In their bags she saw her daughters' trinkets. She
excused herself for a moment, barred the door strongly, roused
her husband, and made it known to him that these guests had
killed his three daughters. Herr Truels called on all his men to
arm. He asked the robbers who was their father. They said that
they had been stolen by robbers, on their way to school, one day;
had had a hard life for fourteen years; and the first crime they
had committed was killing three maids yesterday. Herr Truels
revealed to them that they had murdered their sisters, and
offered them new clothes, in which they might go away. "Nay,"
they said, "not so; life for life is meet." They were taken out
of the town, and their heads struck off.</p>
