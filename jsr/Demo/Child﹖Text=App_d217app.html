ed. W. Chappell, I, 587.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>a</b> was printed at London for F. Coules, who, according
to Mr. Chappell, flourished during the last five years of James
First's reign and throughout that of Charles First: dated by Mr.
Bullen, 1640. <b>b</b> was printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, and J.
Wright, 1655-80 (Chappell). There is another copy in the Euing
collection, No 166, printed for Francis Coles in the Old Bayly,
who may be the same person as the printer of <b>a</b>; and a
fourth in the Douce collection, II, 137, verso, without printer's
name. A copy differing from <b>a</b> by only three words is given
by R.H. Evans, Old Ballads, 1810, I, 88.</p>

<p>Burton, in the fifth edition of his Anatomy of Melancholy,
Oxford, 1638, p. 536, says: "The very rusticks and hog-rubbers
... have their ballads, country tunes, the broome, the bonny,
bonny broome," etc. (Chappell). This remark is not found in the
fourth edition, Oxford, 1632, p. 544. Concerning the air, see
Chappell's Popular Music, pp. 458-61, 613, 783.</p>
