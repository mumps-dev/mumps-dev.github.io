<h3>The White Fisher</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'The White Fisher,' Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 200.
<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d26401.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>A young lord, Willie, asks his 'gay lady' whose the child is
that she is going with. She owns that a priest is the father,
which does not appear to disconcert Willie. A boy is born, and
the mother charges Willie to throw him into the sea, 'never to
return till white fish he bring hame.' Willie takes the boy (now
called his son) to his mother, and tells her that his 'bride' is
a king's daughter; upon which his mother, who had had an ill
opinion of the lady, promises to do as well by Willie's son as
she had done by Willie. Returning to his wife, he finds her
weeping and repining for the 'white fisher' that she had 'sent to
the sea.' Willie offers her a cordial; she says that the man who
could have drowned her son would be capable of poisoning her.
Willie then tells her that his mother has the boy in charge; she
is consoled, and declares that if he had not been the father she
should not have been the mother.</p>

<p>To make this story hang together at all, we must suppose that
the third and fourth stanzas are tropical, and that Willie was
the priest; or else that they are sarcastic, and are uttered in
bitter resentment of Willie's suspicion, or affected suspicion.
But we need not trouble ourselves much to make these counterfeits
reasonable. Those who utter them rely confidently upon our taking
folly and jargon as the marks of genuineness. The white fisher is
a trumpery fancy; 2, 7, 8, 12 are frippery commonplaces.</p>
