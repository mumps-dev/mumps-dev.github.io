<h1>Literature about M[UMPS]</h1>

<p>The literature list can be accessed by
<a href="AnnoStd%EF%B9%96Frame=Literature&amp;Page=author.html">author</a>, by
<a href="AnnoStd%EF%B9%96Frame=Literature&amp;Page=kwic.html">keyword-in-title-context</a>
index or, if the article was published by a MUG or an MTA, by
<a href="AnnoStd%EF%B9%96Frame=Literature&amp;Page=publication.html">publication</a>,
in which the article appeared.</p>

<p><b>Please note</b>: The list of publications by MUGs and MTAs was composed
using the tables of contents of those issues that I have. I am aware that my
collection is quite extensive, but still far from complete. If anyone is in
possession of back-issues that are not currently listed in this section,
please provide me with a copy of the journal(s) in question, so that I
may add the information to the list. Mail can be sent to "Ed de Moel,
57 Magnolia Street, Arlington, Massachusetts,
02474, USA" or electronically to

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>The survey of M[UMPS] related literature that can be accessed
through the above links
has been compiled from a number of sources.</p>

<p>In the past Dr. Harvey from Robert Morris College and
Dr. Kirsten from the J.W. Goete Universit&auml;t published their
literature lists, and I have gratefully incorporated the
wealth of material in their lists in this document.
I am also grateful to the people at the MTA office who allowed
me the use of their compiled documentation of articles in the
various publications of the MUMPS User's Group and the M Technology
Association.</p>

<p>Of course, having combined all these references into one set of
hypertext documents, I am still aware that there must be a lot more
M[UMPS] related literature around.<br/>
If anyone knows of additional literature, please
<a href="mailto:demoel@jacquardsystems.com">let me know</a> too.</p>

<p>One tender point is always the spelling of the names of authors.
Please notify me of any typos I have introduced, I will correct those
immediately.<br/>
However, authors tend to use a different spelling of their names for
different publications, or just because a particular spelling was
<i>the fashion</i> in a specific period (note: this list spans a period
of over 40 years by now). Also, some authors have publications in
this list that they wrote "way back when" when they were novice students,
and currently their names carry respectable titles with them.<br/>
In order to make it possible to group articles by author, I have made
an effort to use the same spelling of a name, regardless of the date
of the publication and I have left out all titles.
In those cases where I know that authors have changed their names
over time, I have used their current names for the older publications
as well.<br/>
Please <a href="mailto:demoel@jacquardsystems.com">let me know</a>
if a different spelling is preferred.</p>

<p>I set up a "keyword-in-context" index based on the titles of the articles.
In such an index, one-letter words are usually omitted. In order to
be able to maintain cross-references to occurrences to M, where this letter
represents the name of the language, I spelled it as M[UMPS].</p>

<p>I included e-mail addresses for those authors of whom I know this
information.
Please <a href="mailto:demoel@jacquardsystems.com">let me know</a>
any updates.</p>
