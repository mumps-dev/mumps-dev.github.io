<p>Buchan had another copy, sent him in manuscript by a young
lady in Aberdeen, in which the Earl Marischal was made prominent:
Ballads, II, 321. Aytoun, I, 139, had a copy which had been
annotated by C.K. Sharpe, and from this he seems to have derived
a few variations. The New Deeside Guide [1832], p. 5 (nominally
by James Brown, but written by Dr. Joseph Robertson), gives 
<b>A</b>, with a few trifling improvements which seem to be 
editorial.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, 1-8. The ballad is accurate as to the
date, not commonly a good sign for such things. On Tuesday, the
eighteenth of June, 1639, Montrose began an attack on the bridge
of Dee, which had been fortified and manned by the royalists of
Aberdeen to stop his advance on the city. The bridge was bravely
defended that day and part of the next by Lieutenant - Colonel
Johnston (not Middleton; Middleton was of the assailants). The
young Lord of Aboyne, just made the king's lieutenant in the
north, had a small body of horse on the north side of the river.
Montrose's cavalry were sent up the south side as if to cross
(though there was no ford), and Aboyne's were moved along the
opposite bank to resist a passage. This exposed the latter to
Montrose's cannon, and the Covenanters let fly some shot at them,
one of which killed "a gallant gentleman, John Seton of
Pitmeddin, most part of his body above the saddle being carried
away." Johnston's leg was crushed by stones brought down from one
of the turrets of the bridge by a cannon-shot, and he had to be
carried off. The loss of their commander and the disappearance of
Aboyne's horse discouraged the now small party who were holding
the bridge, and they abandoned it. Aboyne rode off, and left
Aberdeen to to shift for itself.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d198_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>A</b> 9-12, <b>B</b> 9-13. The spoiling of John Seton by
order of Sir William Forbes of Craigievar is not noticed by
Gordon and Spalding, though other matters of not greater
proportion are.</p>

<p><b>A</b> 1315. The reference is to the affair called the Raid
of Stonehaven, June 15, three days before that of the Bridge of
Dee. Aboyne's Highlanders, a thousand or more, were totally
unused to artillery, and a few shots from Montrose's cannon
lighting among them so frightened them that " they did run off,
all in a confusion, never looking behind them, till they were got
into a moss."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d198_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>B</b> 14-17. "When Montrose entered Aberdeen," says James
Gordon, "the Earl Marischal and Lord Muchall pressed him to burn
the town, and urged him with the Committee of Estates' warrant
for that effect. He answered that it were best to advise a night
upon it, since Aberdeen was the London of the north, and would
prejudice themselves by want of it. So it was taken to
consideration for that night, and next day the Earl Marischal and
Lord Muchall came protesting he would spare it. He answered he
was desirous so to do, but durst not except they would be his
warrant. Whereupon they drew up a paper, signed with both their
hands, declaring that they had hindered it, and promising to
interpose with the Committee of Estates for him. Yet the next
year, when he was made prisoner and accused, this was objected to
Montrose, that he had not burned Aber deen, as he had orders from
the Committee of Estates. Then he produced Marischal and
Muchall's paper, which hardly satisfied the exasperated
committee."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d198_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
