the ballad there in her infancy. She mentions

<i>The four stanzas which follow,</i> "produced 
and handed about in manuscript," <i>in consequence of an
advertisement, were introduced into his copy by Percy.</i><br/>

<i>After</i> 26:<br/>

<br/>
His hair was like the threeds of gold,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Drawne frae Minerva's loome;<br/>
His lipps like roses drapping dew,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His breath was a' perfume.<br/>
<br/>
His brow was like the mountain snae,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gilt by the morning beam;<br/>
His cheeks like living roses glow,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His een like azure stream.<br/>
<br/>
The boy was clad in robes of grene,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sweete as the infant spring,<br/>
And like the mavis on the bush<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He gart the vallies ring.<br/>
<br/>
<i>After</i> 27:

<br/>
That sweetly wavd around his face,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That face beyond compare;<br/>
He sang sae sweet, it might dispel<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A' rage but fell dispair.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The following stanzas were appended to the<br/>
ballad in the edition reprinted by Percy:</i><br/>
<br/>
'Obraid me not, my Lord Barnard,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Obraid me not for shame!<br/>
With that saim speir O pierce my heart,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And put me out o pain.<br/>
<br/>
'Since nothing bot Gill Morice head<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy jelous rage could quell,<br/>
Let that saim hand now tak hir life<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That neir to thee did ill.<br/>
<br/>
'To me nae after days nor nichts<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will eir be saft or kind;<br/>
I'll fill the air with heavy sighs,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And greet till I am blind.'<br/>
<br/>
'<br/>Enouch of blood by me 's bin spilt,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seek not your death frae mee;<br/>
I rather lourd it had been my sel<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than eather him or thee.<br/>
<br/>
'With waefo wae I hear your plaint;<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sair, sair I rew the deid,<br/>
That eir this cursed hand of mine<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had gard his body bleid.<br/>
<br/>
'Dry up your tears, my winsom dame,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ye neir can heal the wound;<br/>
Ye see his head upon the speir,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His heart's blude on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
'I curse the hand that did the deid,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The heart that thocht the ill,<br/>
The feet that bore me wi sik speid<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The comely youth to kill.<br/>
<br/>
'I'll ay lament for Gill Morice,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As gin he were my ain;<br/>
I'll neir forget the dreiry day<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On which the youth was slain.'<br/>
