<h3>Glasgerion</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Glasgerion,' Percy Manuscript, p. 94; Hales and Furnivall, I, 248. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d06701.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
<li>'Glenkindie,' Jamieson's Popular Ballads, I, 93. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d06702.html"><i>Version B</i></a></li>
<li>Kinloch Manuscripts, III, 139. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d06703.html"><i>Version C</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>'Glasgerion' was first printed in Percy's Reliques, III, 43,
1765, and was not thought by the editor to require much
correction. Certainly the English ballad is one which it would be
hard to mend. Scottish <b>B</b> is mainly of good derivation (a
poor old woman in Aberdeenshire), and has some good stanzas, but
Jamieson unfortunately undertook to improve a copy in which the
story was complete, but "the diction much humbled," by combining
with it a fragment of another version. Dr. John Hill Burton
seems, in turn, to have compounded a portion of the ballad as
printed by Jamieson with a fragment from tradition (<b>C</b>):
Kinloch Manuscripts, III, 147.</p>

<p>Cunningham, Songs of Scotland, II, 32, has fused Percy's and
Jamieson's copies, as Motherwell remarks, "in a flux of his own
which has disfigured and quite changed the features of each."</p>

<p>The grete Glascurion is joined in Chaucer's House of Fame,
III, 13-18, with the harper Orpheus, Orion (Arion), and Chiron,
and with Orpheus again by Gavin Douglas, copying Chaucer, in his
Palice of Honour, I, 21, vv 15, 16, ed. Small.</p>

<p>Y Bardd Glas Keraint, in English Keraint the Blue Bard (Blue
Bard being an appellation of a chief bard, who wore an official
robe of blue), is recorded, as Mr. Edward Williams informs us, to
have been an eminent poet of distinguished birth, son of Owain,
Prince of Glamorgan. The English name Glasgerion, Mr. Williams
further remarks, differs not so much from Glasgeraint as most
Welsh names, as written by Englishmen, do from their true
orthography. There is, therefore, at least no absurdity in the
suggestion that the Glascurion of Chaucer and the Glasgerion of
the ballad may represent the Welsh Glas Keraint.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d067_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A peasant lad, tailor's lad, who had overheard the
troth-plight of a knight and lady, anticipates the lover in 'Den
fule Bondedreng,' Kristensen, II, 25-27; 'Torpardr&auml;ngen,'
Hazelius, Ur de Nordiska Folkens Lif, p. 138; 'Die Betrogene,'
Norrenberg, Des d&uuml;lkener Fiedlers Liederbuch, p. 79. The
adventure is jocosely treated in the first two, and does not
amount to a tragedy in the other. A groom forestalls Agilulf,
King of the Lombards, in the Decameron, III, 2, again without a
bloody conclusion.</p>

<p>The marvellous power of the harp in <b>B</b> 2, <b>C</b> 1 is
precisely paralleled in the Scandinavian 'Harpans Kraft,'
Arwidsson, No 149, II, 311-17; Afzelius, No 91, III, 144-47;
Grundtvig, No 40, II, 65-68; Landstad, No 51, p. 475;
&Iacute;s1enzk Fornkv&aelig;&eth;i, No 3, p. 18 f. In these the
fish is harped out of the water, the young from folk and from
fee, the bairn from its mother's womb, the water from the brook,
the hind from the wood, the horns from the hart's head, the bark
from the tree, the dead out of the mould, etc., etc. These
effects are of the same nature as those produced by the harp of
Orpheus, and it is to be observed that in the ballad of 'Harpans
Kraft ' the harper is a bridegroom seeking (successfully) to
recover his bride, who has been carried down to the depths of the
water by a merman. We have had something like these effects in
the 'Twa Brothers,' No 49, <b>B</b> 10, I, 439, where Lady
Margaret harps the small birds off the briers and her true love
out of the grave.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d067_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> There is a fisherman in the Gesta
Romanorum who has a harp so sweet that all the fish in the water
come to his hand: Oesterley, No 85, p. 413, Madden, No 35, p.
116, No 8, p. 293. Equally potent is pipe, flute, or song in many
ballads of various nations; the fish come up from below, the
stars are stopped, the brook rises, the pines vail their top, the
deer stops in its leap, etc., the musician being sometimes an
elf, sometimes an inspired mortal: 'Hr. T&ouml;nne af Als&ouml;,'
Grundtvig, No 34, II, 15, 19, Afzelius, No 7, I, 33, 128;
'Elveh&ouml;j,' Grundtvig, No 46, II, 107-109, Afzelius, No 95,
III, 170, Arwidsson, No 147, II, 301; Kudrun, ed. Bartsch, sts
379, 381, 388; the Roumanian 'Salga,' 'Mihu Copilul,' 'Vidra,'
Stanley, p. 29, Alecsandri, pp 58, 66, 98 f, the same, Ballades
et Chants populaires, pp 118, 168, Murray, pp 44, 53 f, 83; 'El
Poder del Canto,' Mil&aacute;, Romancerillo, No 207, p. 165,
Nigra, Rivista Contemporanea, XX, 78; 'Conde Arnaldos,' Wolf and
Hofmann, No 153, II, 80. For the soporific effect of such music,
as shown in <b>B</b> 5, <b>C</b> 2, there are parallels in
'Albred Lykke,' who sings a ballad which sets everybody asleep
but the young bride who had been stolen from him, Kristensen, I,
281, No 105, sts 11, 12, II, 259 f, No 76, sts 13, 14; 'Den
fortryllende Sang,' Grundtvig, No 243, IV, 470, Danish <b>A</b>
12, 473, Swedish <b>G</b> 25, 26; 'El Rey marinero,' Mil&aacute;,
No 201, p. 151, Briz, I, 117, IV, 15, V, 75; Campbell's West
Highland Tales, I, 291 f.</p>

<p>The oath by oak, ash, and thorn, <b>A</b> 18, is a relic or
trait of high antiquity. We have an oath by the thorn in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_64.html">Fair Janet</a>,'
<b>G</b> 13, '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_68.html">Young Hunting</a>,' <b>K</b> 26; by corn,
grass
sae green and corn, in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_68.html">Young Hunting</a>,' <b>A</b> 16, <b>D</b> 19,
<b>G</b> 7. It is to be supposed that the tree, thorn, corn, was
touched while swearing, a sod taken up in the hand. See Grimm's
Rechtsalterth&uuml;mer, 2d ed., p. 896 f, p. 117 f.</p>

Musgrave and Lady Bernard.'</p>

und Romanzen Alt-Englands, No 59, after Allingham, p. 358.</p>
