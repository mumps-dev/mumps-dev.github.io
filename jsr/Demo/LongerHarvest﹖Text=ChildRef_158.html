<h3>High Spencer's Feats in France</h3>

<p>The king of England, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, sends Hugh Spencer as
ambassador to France, to know whether there is to be peace or war
between the two lands. Spencer takes with him a hundred
men-at-arms, <b>A</b>; twenty ships, <b>B</b>. The French king,
Charles, <b>A</b> 30, declares for war, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>; says
that the last time peace was broken it was not along of him,
<b>B</b>. The queen, Maude, <b>B</b> 9, is indignant that the
king should parley with traitors, <b>A</b>, with English
shepherds, <b>B</b>. She proposes to Spencer a joust with one of
her knights. The Englishman has no jousting-horse. Three horses
are brought out for him, all of which he rejects, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>; in <b>C</b>, two. In <b>A</b> he calls for his old hack
which he had brought over sea; in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, he accepts
a fourth [third], a fiery-eyed black. Spencer breaks his spear, a
French shaft, upon his antagonist; three spears [two] are tied
together to make something strong enough for him to wield. He
unhorses the Frenchman, then rides through the French camp and
kills some thirteen or fourteen score of King Charles's men,
<b>A</b>. The king says he will have his head, <b>A</b>, with
some provocation certainly; the queen says as much in <b>B</b>,
though Spencer has only killed her champion in fair fight.
Spencer has but four true brethren left, <b>A</b> 33; we are not
told what had become of the rest of his hundred. With these, or,
in <b>B</b>, with two, he makes a stand against the royal guard,
and kills scores of them. The French king begs him to hold his
hand, <b>A</b> 34, <b>B</b> 35. There shall never be war with
England while peace may be kept, <b>A</b>; he shall take back
with him all the ships he brought, <b>B</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d158_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Hugh is naturally turned into a Scotsman in the Scottish
version, <b>C</b>. The shepherd's son that he is matched with, 7,
15, is explained by traditional comment to be the queen's
cousin.</p>

<p>These feats of Hugh Spencer do not outstrip those of the
Breton knight Les Aubrays, when dealing with the French, Luzel,
I, 286-305, II, 564-581; nor is his <i>fanfaronnerie</i> much
beyond that of Harry Fifth. The Breton knight was explicitly
helped by St. Anne, but then Spencer and Harry have God and St.
George to borrow.</p>

<p>Liebrecht well remarks, G&ouml;ttinger Gelehrte Anzeigen,
1868, p. 1900, that Spencer's rejecting the three French horses
and preferring his old hack is a characteristically traditional
trait, and like what we read of Walter of Aquitania in the
continuation of his story in the chronicle of the cloister of
Novalesa. After Walter, in his old age, had entered this
monastery, he was deputed to obtain redress for a serious
depredation on the property of the brethren. Asking the people of
the cloister whether they have a horse serviceable for fight in
case of necessity, he is told that there are good strong
cart-horses at his disposal. He has these brought out, mounts one
and another, and condemns all. He then inquires whether the old
steed which he had brought with him is still alive. It is, but
very old, and only used to carry corn to the mill. "Let me see
him," says Walter, and, mounting, cries, "Oh, this horse has not
forgotten what I taught him in my younger days." Grimm u.
Schmeller, Lateinische Gedichte des X. u. XI. Jahrhunderts, p.
109.

<p>Of the many Hugh Spensers if we select the younger of the
favorites of Edward II, his exploits, had they any foundation in
reality, would necessarily fall between 1322, when Charles IV
came to the French throne, and 1326, when the Spensers, father
and son, ended their career. The French king says in <b>B</b> 8
that Spenser had sunk his ships and slain his men. Hugh Spenser
the younger (both, according to Knyghton, col. 2539, but the
father was a very old man) was engaged in piracy in 1321. The
quarrel between Edward II and Charles IV, touching the English
possessions in France, was temporarily arranged in 1325, but not
through the mediation of the younger Spenser, who never was sent
on an embassy to France. Another Sir Hugh Spenser was a commander
in the Earl of Arundel's fleet in the operations against the
French in Charles VI's time, 1387, and was taken prisoner in
consequence of his ship grounding: Knyghton, col. 2693; Nicolas,
History of the Royal Navy, II, 322f. No one of the three queens
of Charles IV bore the name of Maude, which is assigned to the
French queen in B, neither did the queen of Charles VI.</p>
