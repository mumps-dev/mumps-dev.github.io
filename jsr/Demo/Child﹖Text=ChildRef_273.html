<p>1600, October 6, William White, by the consent of Widow
Danter, 'A merye, pleasant and delectable history betwene Kinge
Edward the IIIJ<sup>th</sup> and a Tanner of Tamworthe,' and, by
like consent of the Widow Danter, "the bal[l]ad of the same
matter that was printed by her husband John Danter." Arber, III,
173.</p>

<p>1615, December 9, John Trundle, for a ballad of 'The King and

<p>1624, December 14, Master Pavier, John Wright, and others, a
ballad, 'King and Tanner.' Arber, IV, 131.</p>

<p>The ballad mentioned in the entry under the year 1600 is
unquestionably our ballad, or an earlier form of it. No copy from
the first half of the seventeenth century is known to be
preserved. The "delectable history" entered under the same date
is extant in an edition of 1596, printed by John Danter, and in
one of 1613, printed by William White,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The ballad, as we
have it, was made by abridging the fifty-six stanzas of the
history to thirty-nine, with other changes. The history itself
has its predecessor, and, as Ritson remarks, its undoubted
original, in 'The King and the Barker,'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> between which and
the history, though the former has come down to us in a sadly
mutilated condition, and has been freely treated in the
remodelling, there still remain a few verbal correspondences.
Several good points are added in the history, and one or two
dropped.</p>

<p>'King Edward the Fourth and Tanner of Tamworth,' in Percy's
Reliques, 1765, II, 75, was compounded from Danter's history,
1596, and a copy "in one sheet folio, without date, in the Pepys
collection."</p>

<p>King Edward, while out a-hunting, sees a tanner coming along
the way, and takes a fancy to accost him. Leaving his lords under
a tree, he rides forward and asks the tanner the way to Dray ton
Basset; the tanner directs him to turn in at the first pair of
gallows. The king presses for a civil answer; the tanner bids him
be gone; he himself has been riding all day and is fasting. The
king promises meat and drink of the best for his company to
Drayton Basset; the tanner makes game of the offer, and tries to
get away, but in vain. The king now proposes to change his horse
for the tanner's mare; the tanner demands a noble to boot, nor
shall a cowhide which he is riding on go with the mare. The
cowhide thrown on to the king's saddle frightens the horse and
the tanner is pitched off; after this he will not keep the horse,
but the king in turn exacts a noble to boot. Then the king sounds
his horn, and his attendants come riding in; the tanner takes the
whole party to be strong thieves, but when he sees the suite fall
on their knees he would be glad to be out of the company. 'A
collar! a collar!' cries the king (to make the tanner esquire,
but this is inadvertently left out in the ballad). 'After a
collar comes a halter,' exclaims the unhappy tanner. But the king
is graciously pleased to pay for the sport which he has had by
conferring on the tanner an estate of three hundred pound a
year;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in return for which his grateful liegeman engages to
give him clouting-leather for his shoon if ever he comes to
Tamworth.</p>

<p>Next to adventures of Robin Hood and his men, the most
favorite topic in English popular poetry is the chance-encounter
of a king, unrecognized as such, with one of his humbler
subjects. Even in the Robin Hood cycle we have one of these
meetings (in the seventh and eighth fits of the Little Gest), but
there the king visits Robin Hood deliberately and in disguise,
whereas in the other tales (except the latest) the meeting is
accidental.</p>

<p>The most familiar of these tales are 'The King and the
Tanner,' and 'The King and the Miller;' the former reaching back
beyond the sixteenth century, the latter perhaps not beyond the
seventeenth, but modelled upon tales of respectable antiquity, of
which there is a specimen from the early years of the thirteenth
century.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>In the history or "ballad" of 'The King and the Miller,' or,
more specifically, '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_32.html">King Henry</a> Second and the Miller of
Mansfield,' the king, while hunting in Sherwood, loses his nobles
and is overtaken by night; he meets a miller, and after some
colloquy is granted a lodging; is entertained with bag-puddings
and apple-pies, to which is added a course of 'light-foot,' a
pasty of the king's deer, two or three of which, the miller tells
his guest in confidence, he always keeps in store. The nobles
recover the king at the miller's the next morning; the miller
looks to be hanged when he sees them fall on their knees; the
king dubs him knight. The king has relished his night with the
miller so much that he determines to have more sport out of him,
and commands the attendance of the new knight with his lady and
his son Dick at court on St. George's day. The three jet down to
the king's hall on their mill-horses. In the course of the dinner
the king expresses a wish for some of their light-foot; Dick
tells him that it is knavery to eat of it and then betray it. Sir
John Cockle and Dick dance with the court-ladies, and the
buffoonery ends by the king's making the miller overseer of
Sherwood, with a stipend of three hundred pound, to which he
attaches an injunction to steal no more deer.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Of the older poems, 'John the Reeve' (910 vv.) may be noticed
first, because it has a nearly complete story, and also
resemblance in details with 'The King and the Tanner,' or 'The
King and the Miller,' which two others of perhaps earlier date
have not. 'John the Reeve' is now extant only in the Percy
Manuscript (p. 357, Hales and Furnivall, II, 550). Since there
had been but three kings of the name of Edward (v. 16), it must
have been composed, as Mr. Hales has remarked, between the death
of Edward III and the accession of Edward IV, 1376-1461, and
forms of language show that the Percy text must be nearer the end
than the beginning of this period.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Edward Longshanks, while hunting, is separated from all his
train but a bishop and an earl. Night comes on, and they know not
where they are, and the weather is cold and rough. As they stand
considering which way to turn, a stout carl rides by; they beg
him to take them to some harbor. The fellow will at first have
nothing to do with them, but finally shows a disposition to be
accommodating if they will swear to do him no harm; all that he
can promise them, however, is beef and bread, bacon a year old,
and sour ale; as for a good fire, which the king would
particularly like, they cannot have that, for fuel is dear. They
ride on to a town, light at a comely hall, and are taken into a
room with a bright fire and candles lighted. The carl, who has
already described himself as John the Reeve, husbandman and the
king's bondman, inquires of the earl who the long fellow may be,
and who the other in the sark: the first, he is told, is Piers,
the queen's chief falconer, the other a poor chaplain, and the
earl himself a sumpterman. 'Proud lads, and I trow penniless,' is
John's comment; he himself, though not so fine, has a thousand
pound and more. They move on to the hall, and are civilly
received by the goodwife. John marshals the company, now
increased by two daughters of the house, and by Hodge and Hob,
two neighbors, setting the three strangers and his wife at the
head of the table, his daughters farther down, and taking the end
himself with his neighbors. Bean-bread, rusty bacon, lean salt
beef a year old, and sour ale are brought in, and every one has a
mess. The king murmurs, John says, Thou, gettest no other; the
king coaxes, John will not give them a morsel unless they swear
never to tell of him to Edward. All three pledge their troth, and
then come in fine bread, wine red and white, in silver cups, the
boar's head, capons, venison, everything that king could have or
crave. After the supper, John, Hob, and Hodge perform a rustic
dance; King Edward (who gets his shins kicked) never had so merry
a night. In the morning they hear mass and eat a good breakfast,
for which they promise warison, and then the king takes leave and
rides to Windsor. The lords have a good story to tell the queen;
she prays the king to send for the reve. John is convinced that
he has been beguiled by his guests, but arms himself with such as
he has, and, after a huge libation with Hodge and Hob, sets
forth. The porter at the palace will not let him in; John knocks
him over the crown and rides into the hall. Neither before this
nor then will he vail hat or hood. [The passage in which the reve
discovers that Piers falconer was the king has dropped out.] John
bears himself sturdily; the king can punish him, but the king is
honorable and will keep his word, and may remember the promised
warison. The king gives thanks for the hot capons and good wine,
the queen urges that the reve should be promoted. The king,
nothing loath, makes John a gentleman, and gives him his manor, a
hundred pound and a tun of wine yearly, then takes a collar and
creates him knight. John blenches a little at the collar; he has
heard that after a collar comes a rope; but he recovers his nerve
after supping off a gallon of wine at the table. It is now the
bishop's turn to do something; he promises his good offices for
John's two sons and two daughters; these, in the end, are well
disposed of, and Hodge and Hob are made freemen. John ever after
keeps open board for all guests that God sends him.</p>

<p>The tale of Rauf Coilyear,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> shortly after 1480, has for
its personages Charles the Great and a charcoal-burner. Charles,
on his way to Paris from St. Thomas, is isolated from his cortege
by a fierce storm; night has come on and he is in a strait for
shelter. By good luck Rauf makes his appearance, a churl of
prodigious inurbanity, but ready to take in any good fellow that
is 'will of his way.' Arrived at his house, Rauf calls to his
wife to make a fire and kill capons. When supper is dight, the
guest is told to give the goodwife his hand and take the head of
the table. Charles hangs back; the churl, who has once before
criticised his manners, hits him under the ear and sends him
sprawling to the floor. There is a plenteous supper, in which
venison is not lacking. The carl tells the king that the
foresters have threatened to send him to Paris for deer stealing,
but he means to have enough for himself and a guest in spite of
them. Then after wine they sit by the fire and the collier tells
many a tale. Charles is affable; Rauf asks him his name and where
he lives; Wymond is his name, and he lives with the queen, in
fact, is of her bed-chamber; if Rauf will come to court he shall
have the better sale for his fuel. Charles is put to bed in a
handsome room, and rises so early that he has to waken his host
to take leave. He is urged not to go so soon, but to-morrow is
Yule and every officer of the court must be at his post. He
wishes to pay the goodwife for her good entertainment; Rauf will
not hear of such a thing. Come to court to-morrow, says the king;
I want coals myself. Roland and Oliver and a thousand more have
been wandering all night in search of their lord, and thank God
when they recover him on the road to Paris. Rauf sets out for the
court with his coals, according to appointment; the king has him
in mind, and sends out Roland to bring in such man as he may
meet. Roland finds the collier intractable, and has to return
without him. The king is displeased, and Roland is on the point
of going again, when he learns from a porter that there is a man
with a horse and baskets at the gate who will not be turned away.
Rauf is let in; he gives his horse in charge to the porter, and
pushes into the hall to find Wymond, and after being shoved about
a good deal, gets sight of him, dressed in cloth of gold, and
clearly a much greater man than he had called himself; he is
daunted by all the splendor; if he could but get away, nothing
should bring him to the court again. The king then tells the
story of his night at Rauf's, not pretermitting the carl's rough
behavior. The lords laugh, the knights are for hanging him; the
king thinks he owes better thanks, and dubs Rauf knight, assigns
him three hundred a year, and promises him the next fief that
falls vacant.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>'King Edward Third and the Shepherd,' Manuscript of about
1450, Cambridge University Library, Ff. 5. 48 b, 1090
vv.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The king, while taking his pleasure by a river-side one
morning, meets Adam, a shepherd, and engages in talk with him.
The shepherd complains of the king's men, who help themselves to
his beasts, sheep, hens, and geese, and at best pay with a tally.
Edward is concerned for the king's good fame; he is a merchant,
but has a son with the queen who can get any boon of her, and the
shepherd shall have what is due him. That is four pound two, says
Adam, and you shall have seven shillings for your service. It is
arranged that the shepherd shall come to court the next day and
ask the porter for Joly Robyn. The king is kept a long time by
the shepherd's stories, but not too long, for when he is invited
to come home and take a bit to eat he accepts with pleasure. They
see many a coney, hart, and hind, on their way, and the king
tries to put up Adam, who has been bragging of his skill with the
sling, to kill a few; but the man, as he says, knows very well
the danger of poaching, and never touches anything but wild fowl.
Of these they have all sorts at their meal, and two-penny ale.
Before they set to drinking, Adam instructs the king in an
indispensable form: he that drinks first must call out
'passilodion,' and the respondent 'berafrynd.'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_13.html">Edward</a> praises the
dinner, but owns to a hankering for a little game. Can you keep a
secret? asks the shepherd; indeed he can. Upon this assurance,
Adam fetches pasties of rabbits and deer; of these he is wont to
kill more than he himself needs, and sends presents to gentlemen
and yeomen, who in return furnish him with bread, ale, and wine.
Wine follows: Edward calls 'passilodion;' Adam is ready with
'berafrynd.' The king now takes leave, but before he goes the
shepherd shows him a room underground well stored with venison
and wine, and they have one draught more. The next day the
shepherd goes to court and asks the porter for Joly Robyn. The
king has prepared his lords for the visit, and directed them to
call him by that name. Adam is paid his four pound two, and
offers Robyn the promised seven shillings for his mediation.
Robyn will take nothing; he would do much more than that for
love; Adam must dine with him, and is placed at the head of a
table. The king sends the prince to Adam for a bout of
passilodion; Adam says the merchant has betrayed him, and wishes
he were out of the place. A squire is now ordered to tell Adam
that Joly Robyn is the king. Adam puts down his hood, which up to
this time he would do for nobody,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> falls on his knees, and
cries mercy. The rest is wanting, but we may be certain that Adam
was knighted and presented with an estate.</p>

<p>'King Edward and the Hermit,' Manuscript Ashmole 6922, of
about 1450, a fragment of 522 vv.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The king, hunting in Sherwood, follows a remarkably large deer
till he loses himself. By the favor of St. Julian, he discovers a
hermitage; he asks quarters for the night; the hermit lives on
roots and rinds, and such a lord would starve with him, but he
yields to urgency. The guest must take such as he finds, and that
is bread and cheese and thin drink. King Edward expresses his
surprise that the hermit should not help himself out with the
deer; the hermit is much too loyal for that, and besides, the
peril is to be considered. Still the king presses for venison; no
man shall know of it; the hermit, convinced that he is safe with
his company, brings out venison, salt and fresh, and then a
four-gallon pot. The king is taught to drink in good form; when
one calls 'fusty bandyas,' the other must come in with 'stryke
pantere;' and thus they lead holy life. Such cheer deserves
requital; if the hermit will come to court, where his guest is
living, he has only to ask for Jack Fletcher, and they two will
have the best that is there; the 'frere,' though not eager to
close with this proposal, says he will venture a visit. To show
Jack more of his privity he takes him into his bedroom and gives
him a bow to draw; Jack can barely stir the string; the frere
hauls to the head an arrow an ell long. Then, wishing that he had
a more perfect reliance on Jack's good faith, the hermit exhibits
his stock of venison, after which they go back to their drinking,
and keep it up till near day. They part in the morning; the king
reminds his host of the promised visit, and rides straight for
home. His knights, who have been blowing horns for him all night
in the forest, are made happy by hearing his bugle, and return to
the town. This is all that is preserved, but again we may be
confident that King Edward made the hermit an abbot.</p>

<p>That the hermit had some habilitation for such promotion
appears from a story told by Giraldus Cambrensis two hundred
years be fore the apparent date of any of these poems.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>King Henry Second, separated from his men in hunting, came to
a Cistercian house at nightfall and was hospitably received, not
as king (for this they knew not), but as a knight of the king's
house and retinue. After a handsome supper, the abbot asked his
help in some business of the fraternity on which he was to visit
the king the next day, and this was readily promised. The abbot,
to improve his guest's good disposition, had his health drunk in
many a cup of choice wine, after the English fashion; but instead
of the customary salutation or challenge 'wes heil!'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> called
'pril!' The king, who would have answered 'drinc heil!' was at a
loss how to respond; he was told that 'wril!' was the word. And
so with 'pril' and 'wril' they pursued their compotation, monks,
freres, guests, servants, deep into the night. The next morning
the king rejoined his party, who had been much alarmed at losing
him. Order was given that when the abbot came he should be
immediately admitted, and it was not long before he made his
appearance, with two of his monks. The king received him
graciously, all that he asked was granted; the abbot begged leave
to retire, but the king carried him off to luncheon and seated
him by his side. After a splendid meal, the king, lifting a big
cup of gold, called out, 'Pril, father abbot!' The abbot,
staggering with shame and fear, begged his grace and forgiveness.
The king swore by God's eyes that as they had eaten and drunk
together in good fellowship the night before, so should it be
to-day; and it should be 'pril' and 'wril' in his house as it had
been at the convent. The abbot could not but obey, and stammered
out his 'wril,' and then king and abbot, knights and monks, and,
at the king's command, everybody in hall and court, kept up
unremittingly a merry and uproarious interchange of 'pril' and
'wril.' Of all the four old poems we may repeat what Percy has
said of 'John the Reeve,' that "for genuine humor, diverting
incidents, and faithful pictures of rustic manners, they are
infinitely superior to all that have been since written in
imitation," meaning by these the broadside ballads or
histories.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_016','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A brief account of such of these as have not
been spoken of (all of very low quality) is the utmost that is
called for.</p>

<p>'The Shepherd and the King.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_017','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> King Alfred, disguised in
ragged clothes, meets a shepherd, and all but demands a taste of
his scrip and bottle. The shepherd will make him win his dinner,
sword and buckler against sheephook. They fight four hours, and
the king cries truce; 'there is no sturdier fellow in the land
than thou,' says the king; 'nor a lustier roister than thou,'
says the shepherd. The shepherd thinks his antagonist at best a
ruined prodigal, but offers to take him as his man; Alfred
accepts the place, is equipped with sheep-hook, tar-box, and dog,
and accompanies his master home. Dame Gillian doubts him to be a
cut-throat, and rates him roundly for letting her cake burn as he
sits by the fire.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_018','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Early the next morning Alfred blows his horn,
to the consternation of Gill and her husband, who are still abed.
A hundred men alight at the door; they have long been looking for
their lord. The shepherd expects to be hanged; both he and his
wife humbly beg pardon. Alfred gives his master a thousand
wethers and pasture ground to feed them, and will change the
cottage into a stately hall.</p>

<p>'King James and the Tinker.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_019','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> King James, while chasing
his deer, drops his nobles, and rides to an ale-house in search
of new pleasures, finds a tinker there, and sets to drinking with
him. The tinker has never seen the king, and wishes he might;
James says that if he will get up behind him he shall see the
king. The tinker fears that he shall not know the king from his
lords; the nobles will all be bare, the king covered. When they
come to the greenwood the nobles gather about the king and stand
bare; the tinker whispers, 'they are all gallant and gay, which,
then, is the king?' 'It must be you or I,' answers James, for the
rest are all uncovered. The tinker falls on his knees, beseeching
mercy; the king makes him a knight with five hundred a year.
(Compare the story of James Fifth of Scotland and John Howieson,
Scott's Tales of a Grandfather, ch. 27.)</p>

<p>'The King and the Forester.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_020','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> King William the Third,
forbidden to hunt by a forester who does not recognize him, tries
in vain to bribe the man, makes himself known, presents the
forester with fifty guineas, and appoints him ranger.</p>

<p>'The Royal Frolick, or, King William and his Nobles'
Entertainment at the Farmer's House on his return from the Irish
wars.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_021','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> King William, 'returning to London from Limerick
fight,' stops at a farm-house 'for merriment sake,' and asks
country cheer for himself and his nobles. The farmer and his wife
have gone to the next market-town to see the king pass, and their
daughter alone is at home. She serves bacon and eggs, all that
she has; the king throws her ten guineas, and one of his lords
adds two for loyal sentiments which the girl had expressed. In a
Second Part the farmer and his wife, when they return, learn that
the king is at their house, are ordered into his presence, and
are rewarded for the meal which had been furnished.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_022','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>'The King and the Cobbler' (a prose his-tory).<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_023','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> King
Henry Eighth, visiting the watches in the city, makes
acquaintance with a cobbler, and is entertained in the cobbler's
cellar; invites the cobbler to court, directing him to inquire
for Harry Tudor, etc.; settles upon him land in the Strand worth
fifty pound a year, which land is to be called Cobler's Acre.</p>

<p>Campbell, West Highland Tales, IV, 142, says that he has a
Gaelic tale like 'The Miller of Mansfield.'</p>

<p>A Belgian story of the Emperor Charles Fifth and a broom-maker
has all the typical points of the older cycle, and, curiously
enough, Charles Fifth instructs the broom-maker to bring a load
of his ware to the palace to sell, as Charles the Great does in
the case of Rauf Coilyear: Maria von Ploennies, Die Sagen
Belgiens, p. 251.</p>

<p>The same collection, p. 246 f., has the story of the man who
wished to see the king (an anecdote of Charles Fifth and a
peasant). This story turns up again in Thiele's 'Kongen og
Bonden,' Danmarks Folkesager, I, 62 (1843). Christian the Fourth,
after a long walk, takes a seat in the cart of a countryman who
is on his way to the castle. The countryman wishes that he might
see the king; the king will be the only man to keep his hat on;
the countryman says, It must be you or I.</p>

<p>After the older pattern is this Russian story, Afanasief, VII,
233, No 32 (given me by Professor Wollner). A tsar who has lost
himself while hunting passes the night with a deserter in a
robbers-hut in a wood. They draw lots who shall stand guard, and
the lot falls to the tsar, to whom the soldier gives his
side-arms. Notwithstanding many warnings, the tsar dozes on his
post, and at last the soldier, first punishing him a little,
packs him off to sleep. The robbers come, one by one, and are
shot by the soldier. The next day the deserter shows the tsar his
road, and afterwards pays the tsar a visit at court, discovers
who his comrade was, and is made general.</p>

<p>The Emperor Maximilian Second, while walking in a wood, comes
upon a charcoal-burner; they have a talk, and the emperor is
invited to share the man's dumplings. Maximilian asks the
charcoal-burner to pay him a visit when he comes to the city,
lets him see the princes and the empress, and gives him a
luncheon. There is no <i>&eacute;claircissement</i> at the time.
In the end the charcoal-burner and his family are employed in the
imperial garden.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d273_024','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Robert Dodsley made a very pleasing little sentimental drama
out of 'The King and the Miller of Mansfield ' (1737), and from
this play (perhaps through a translation, 'Le Roi et le Meunier,'
made before 1756), S&eacute;daine took the substance of 'Le Roi
et le Fermier,' 1762, and Coll&eacute; the idea of 'La Partie de
Chasse de Henri IV, 1774.' Goldoni's musical drama, 'Il re alia
caccia'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_32.html">King Henry</a> IV of England), produced a year after
S&eacute;daine's play, seems to have been suggested by it: vol.
37 of the edition of Venice, 1794.</p>

<p>Percy's ballad is translated by Bodmer, I, 172.</p>
