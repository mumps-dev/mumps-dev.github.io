<i>Motherwell sent this copy to C.K. Sharpe in a letter 
dated October</i> 8, 1825, <i>in which he says:</i> I also 
send rather a curious song, which perchance 
you may have seen, entitled 'The Turkish Galley,'
the air of which pleased me much. But as 
I learn there are two other different sets of the 
words more complete than my copy, and with 
different airs, I shall defer sending the musick 
till I can send also that which belongs to the 
other copies.</td></tr>
