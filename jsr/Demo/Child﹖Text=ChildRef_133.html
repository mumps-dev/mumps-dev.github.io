</ol>

<p><b>a</b> is printed, with changes, by Ritson, Robin Hood,
1795, II, 122. Evans, Old Ballads, 1777, 1784, 1, 180, agrees
with the Aldermary garland.</p>

<p>There is a copy in the Roxburghe Collection, III, 20.</p>

<p>Robin Hood, riding towards Nottingham, comes upon a beggar,
who asks charity. Robin says he has no money, but must have a
bout with him. The beggar with his staff gives three blows for
every stroke of Robin's with his sword. Robin cries truce, and at
the suggestion, we might almost say upon the requisition, of the
beggar, exchanges his horse and finery for the beggar's bags and
rags. Thus equipped, he proceeds to Nottingham, and has the
adventure with the sheriff and three yeomen which is the subject
of No 140.</p>

<p>The copy in the Wood and in the Roxburghe collections is
signed T.R., like Robin Hood and the Butcher, <b>B</b>, and, like
the latter ballad, this is a rifacimento, with middle rhyme in
the third line. It is perhaps made up from two distinct stories;
the Second Part, beginning at stanza 20, from Robin Hood rescuing
Three Squires, and what precedes from a ballad resembling Robin
Hood and the Beggar, II.</p>

<p>But no seventeenth-century version of Robin Hood and the
Beggar, II, is known, and it is more likely that we owe the fight
between Robin Hood and the Beggar to the folly and bad taste of
T.R. Robin has no sort of provocation to fight with the beggar,
and no motive for changing clothes, the proposition actually
coming from the beggar, st. 15, and it is an accident that his
disguise proves useful (cf. Guy of Gisborne). The beggar should
have reported that three men were to be hanged, but instead of
this is forced into a fight, in order that one more ignominious
defeat may be scored against Robin.</p>

<p>occur also in Robin Hood and the Bishop, No 143,
