<h3>266. John Thomson and the Turk</h3>

<p>This ridiculous ballad is a seedling from the ancient and
widespread story of King Solomon and his wife. A typical version,
preserved in a Russian prose tale, may be summarized as follows:
The wife of Solomon is stolen from him by his brother Kitovras,
through the agency of a magician, who, in the character of a
merchant, excites Solomon's admiration for a magnificent purple
robe. Solomon buys the robe, and invites the seeming merchant to
his table. During the repast the magician envelops the king and
his people in darkness, brings a heavy slumber upon the queen and
her people, and carries her off in his arms to his ship. Solomon
proceeds against Kitovras with an army, which he orders to come
to his help when they shall hear his horn sound the third
time.</p>

<p>Clad as an old pilgrim or beggar, lie enters Kitovras's
garden, where he comes upon a girl with a gold cup, who is about
to draw water. He asks to drink from the king's cup. The girl
objects, but the gift of a gold ring induces her to consent. The
queen sees the ring on the girl's hand, and asks who gave it to
her. 'An old pilgrim,' she replies. 'No pilgrim,' says the queen,
'but my husband, Solomon.' Solomon is brought before the queen,
and asked what he has come for. 'To take off your head,' he
answers. 'To your own death!' rejoins the queen. 'You shall be
hanged.' Kitovras is sent for, and pronounces this doom. Solomon
reminds Kitovras that they are brothers, and asks that he may die
in regal style; that Kitovras and the queen shall attend the
execution, with all the people of the city; and that there shall
be ample provision of food and drink: all which is granted. At
the gallows he finds a noose of bast; he begs that two other
nooses may be provided, one of red silk, one of yellow, so that
he may have a choice, and this whim is complied with. Always
urging their brotherhood, Solomon, at three successive stages,
asks the privilege of blowing his horn. The army is at hand upon
the third blast, and is ordered to kill everybody. Kitovras and
the queen are hanged in the silken nooses, the magician in the
bast. (Jagi&eacute;, Archiv fur slavische Philologie, 1, 107 f.;
Vesselofsky, the same, vi, 406.)</p>

<p>Other versions of the Solomon story are found in the old
German poems of Salman und Morolf, Salomon undMorolf,and Kduig
Rother, in the Cliges of Crestien de Troies, in the romance of Li
Bastars de Buillon, in the Portuguese legem! of Don Ramiro, and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Two versions of the Scottish ballad are known, <b>A</b> and
<b>B</b>, the latter a fragment of four stanzas. Leyden, to whom
we owe <b>B</b>, says that he "had heard the whole song when
very young.</p>
