<p><b>C</b> was furnished Jamieson from Herd's Manuscripts by
Scott, and underwent a few slight changes in publication.
Jamieson inquired through the Scots Magazine, October, 1803, p.
699, for the conclusion, which is wanting, but unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>The only variation of much moment in the five versions of this
tragedy is that, in <b>C</b>, the bridegroom and the lover are
not brothers, but uncle and nephew. Some inconsistencies have
been created in the course of tradition. The bride's insisting on
having twenty men before her and twenty on each side, ere she
will go to kirk, not to mention the extravagance of twenty
milk-white doves above her head, <b>C</b> 22,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d066_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> is
incompatible with her aversion to the "weary wedding," and with
her language about the bridegroom's gifts in <b>C</b> 4, 5,
<b>D</b> 4-6, <b>E</b> 8-10. There is much confusion at the end.
After the death of the two rivals the lady, in <b>E</b>, imposes
on herself the penance of begging her bread as a pilgrim for the
rest of her days. This penance we find also in the two last
stanzas of <b>A</b>, and a trace of it in <b>B</b> 20, <b>D</b>
10. Another, and probably later, representation is that she went
mad, <b>A</b> 30, <b>B</b> 19, <b>D</b> 9. The two are blended in
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>; unless we are to suppose that
Maisry's adopting a beggar's life was a consequence of her
madness, which is not according to the simplicity of old ballads.
That something was due the unfortunate Lord Ingram, especially if
he was disposed to relinquish his wife to his brother, <b>B</b>
17, the modern sense of justice will admit; but that Maisry's
remorse on account of the handsome wedding Ingram had given her
should exceed her grief for Chiel Wyet, <b>A</b> 32, <b>B</b> 20,
<b>D</b> 10, <b>E</b> 43, 44, is as little natural as romantic,
and is only to be explained as an exhibition of imbecility,
whether on her part or on the part of some reciter who gave that
turn to the story. <b>B</b> confounds confusion by killing Maisry
on the top of all.</p>

<p>The sword laid in bed between man and woman, <b>B</b> 14,
<b>E</b> 30, as a sign or pledge of continence, does not occur
often in popular ballads. We have it in 'S&uuml;deli,' Uhland, I,
275, No 121, st. 11, and in two of the Swedish forms of
Grundtvig's 'Brud i Vaande,' Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, V, 345,
No. 277, D, sts 26, 27, and Arwidsson, II, 248, No 132, sts 21,
22, 'Fru Margaretha.' In popular tales: Grimms, K. u. H.
m&auml;rchen, No 60; Asbj&oslash;rnsen og Moe, Norske
Folkeeventyr, No 3; II Pentamerone, I, 9; Hahn's Griechische
M&auml;rchen, I, 171, No 122. In Norse poetry and saga:
V&ouml;lsunga saga, 27, Rafn, Fornaldar S&ouml;gur, I, 187;
S&aelig;mund's Edda, Sigur&eth;arkvi&eth;a, III, 65, L&uuml;ning,

<p>Lord Wayets, in <b>C</b> 17, kicks up the table and sends the
silver cup into the fire. Young Beichan takes the table with his
foot and makes the cups and cans to flee, <b>B</b> 18, <b>D</b>
23, <b>F</b> 28, <b>J</b> 5, <b>N</b> 42, or makes the table
flee, <b>H</b> 42; so the knight in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_63.html">Child Waters</a>,' <b>G</b> 18,
the baron in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_83.html">Child Maurice</a>,' <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, and the mother
in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_91.html">Fair Mary of Wallington</a>,' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. Kinmont Willie,
st. 9, takes the table with his hand and gars the red wine spring
on hie. The table, being of boards laid on trestles, would be
easy to ding over or make flee. Being also narrow, it might be
jumped over, and those in whose way it might be seem to have
preferred to clear it in that fashion, at least out of Britain.
So the Danish Lord Lovel on hearing of his love's death, spilling
the mead or wine, Kristensen, II, No 20, <b>A</b> 6, <b>B</b> 10,
<b>C</b> 3, <b>D</b> 4; Sir Peter in Afzelius, No 9, I, 50,
Grundtvig, No 210, IV, 220, etc. The king in the Icelandic
Ribbalds kv&aelig;&eth;i, to be sure, kicks the table away and
spills the mead and wine, &Iacute;slenzk Fornkv&aelig;&eth;i, No
16, <b>B</b> 8, <b>C</b> 2, so that Lord Wayets, Young Beichan,
and others may have taken their cue from that island. But against
this we may put Hervarar saga, c. 3, Fornaldar S&ouml;gur, I,
516; Olafs saga hins Helga, c. 50, Keyser and Unger, p. 36;
Grundtvig, Danmarks Folkeviser, No 11, <b>A</b> 23, No 13,
<b>B</b> 18, <b>G</b> 15, <b>I</b> 16; etc. In 'Magnus
Algots&oslash;n,' Grundtvig, No 181, <b>D</b> 18, the bride jumps
over the table and goes off with her old love; in Su&#353;il's
Bohemian ballads, No 135, p. 131, the bride jumps over four
tables and on to a fifth to get at her first betrothed; in the
Novella della Figlia del Re di Dacia, ed. Wesselofsky, p. 38, the
duke jumps over the table to get to his wife; in a German ballad
in Schr&ouml;er's Ausflug nach Gottschee, p. 210 f, the
bridegroom, who has lost the bride, jumps over the table to get
out of the room as soon as possible; a French gentleman takes a
vault over the table before him, Gautier, Les
&Eacute;pop&eacute;es Fran&ccedil;aises, I, 508, ed. 1865, and a
lady in a ludicrous anecdote told in the Zimmerische Chronik, ed.
Barack, 1881, II, 132 f. But Torello's wife, on the other hand,
Decameron, X, 9, throws down the table which bars her way to her
lord, and so does the steward in 'Sir Orfeo,' v. 576, ed.
Zielke.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d066_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Ebbe Skammels&oslash;n, being obliged to absent himself from
his plighted maid for a considerable time, loses her through the
artifices of his brother [and mother], who pretends first that
Ebbe is unfaithful, and then that he is dead. Ebbe is warned by a
dream that his brother is about to wed his mistress, goes home in
great haste, and arrives on the wedding-day. He kills the bride,
and then his brother, who, at the last moment, offers to cede the
bride to him, as Lord Ingram, in <b>B</b> 17, says he meant to
do. Ebbe after this begs his bread, or goes on a pilgrimage
weighted with iron on his hands and loins; wherein his part
resembles Maisry's. Danske Viser, III, 75, No 120, translated by
Prior, II, 380; Arwidsson, No 33, I, 216, 224, 412; Atterbom's
Poetisk Kalender, 1816, p. 55.</p>

<p>It may be worth noting that Maisry's wedding, according to
<b>B</b> 20, was "in good kirk-door," like the five of The Wife
of Bath.</p>
