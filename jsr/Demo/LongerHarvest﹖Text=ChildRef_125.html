<p>Ritson, Robin Hood, 1795, II, 138; Evans, Old Ballads, 1777,
1784, I, 204. There is a bad copy in a Robin Hood's Garland of
1749.</p>

<p>"This ballad," says Ritson, "is named in a schedule of such
things under an agreement between W. Thackeray and others in
1689, Col. Pepys, vol. 5." It occurs in a list of ballads printed
for and sold by William Thackeray at the Angel in Duck-Lane (see
The Ballad Society's reprint of the Roxburghe Ballads, W.
Chappell, I, xxiv, from a copy in the Bagford collection), but by
some caprice of fortune has not, so far as is known, come down in
the broadside form, neither is it found in the older garlands.</p>

<p>Robin Hood and Little John belongs to a set of ballads which
have middle rhyme in the third line of the stanza, and are
directed to be sung to one and the same tune. These are: R.H. and
the Bishop, R.H. and the Beggar, R.H. and the Tanner, to the tune
of R.H. and the Stranger; R.H. and the Butcher, R.H.'s Chase,
Little John and the Four Beggars, to the tune of R.H. and the
Beggar; R.H. and Little John, R.H. and the Ranger, to the tune of
Arthur a Bland (that is, R.H. and the Tanner). There is no ballad
with the title Robin Hood and the Stranger. Ritson thought it
proper to give this title to a ballad which uniformly bears the
title of Robin Hood Newly Revived, No 128, because Robin's
antagonist is repeatedly called "the stranger" in it. But Robin's
antagonist is equally often called "the stranger" in the present
ballad (eleven times in each), and Robin Hood and Little John has
the middle rhyme in the third line, which Robin Hood Newly
Revived has not (excepting in seven stanzas at the end, which are
a portion of a different ballad, Robin Hood and the Scotchman).
Robin Hood and Little John (and Robin Hood Newly Revived as well)
would naturally be referred to as Robin Hood and the Stranger,
for the same reason that Robin Hood and the Tanner is referred to
as Arthur a Bland. The fact that the middle rhyme in the third
line is found in Robin Hood and Little John, but is lacking in
Robin Hood Newly Revived, gives a slightly superior probability
to the supposition that the former, or rather some older version
of it (for the one we have is in a rank seventeenth-century
style), had the secondary title of Robin Hood and the
Stranger.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d125_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Like Robin Hood's Progress to Nottingham, this ballad affects,
in the right apocryphal way, to know an adventure of Robin's
early life. Though but twenty years old, Robin has a company of
threescore and nine bowmen. With all these he shakes hands one
morning, and goes through the forest alone, prudently enjoining
on the band to come to his help if he should blow his horn. He
meets a stranger on a narrow bridge, and neither will give way.
Robin threatens the stranger with an arrow, which, as he requires
to be reminded, is cowardly enough, seeing that the other man has
nothing but a staff. Recalled to ordinary manliness, Robin Hood,
laying down his bow, provides himself with an oaken stick, and
proposes a battle on the bridge, which he shall be held to win
who knocks the other into the water in the end. In the end the
stranger tumbles Robin into the brook, and is owned to have won
the day. The band are now summoned by the horn, and when they
hear what the stranger has done are about to seize and duck him,
but are ordered to forbear. Robin Hood proposes to his antagonist
that he shall join his men, and John Little, as he declares his
name to be, accedes. John Little is seven foot tall.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d125_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Will
Stutely says his name must be changed, and they rebaptize the
"infant" as Little John.</p>

<p>'A pastorall plesant commedie of Robin Hood and Little John,
etc.,' is entered to Edward White in the Stationers' Registers,
May 14, 1594, and 'Robin Hood and Litle John' to Master Oulton,
April 22, 1640. (Arber, II, 649, IV, 507.)</p>
