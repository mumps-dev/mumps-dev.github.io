<p>The four copies of <b>A</b> differ but very slightly:
<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b> are broadsides, and <b>d</b> is evidently 
of that derivation, <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are of the 17th 
century. There is another broadside in the 
Euing collection, formerly Halliwell's, No 
253. The version in The Borderer's Table 
Book, VII, 83, was compounded by Dixon 
from others previously printed.</p>

<p>Riddles, as is well known, play an important part in popular
story, and that from very remote times. No one needs to be
reminded of Samson, &OElig;dipus, Apollonius of Tyre. Riddle-tales,
which, if not so old as the oldest of these, may be carried in
all likelihood some centuries beyond our era, still live in
Asiatic and European tradition, and have their representatives in
popular ballads. The largest class of these tales is that in
which one party has to guess another's riddles, or two rivals
compete in giving or guessing, under penalty in either instance
of forfeiting life or some other heavy wager; an example of
which is the English ballad, modern in form, of 'King John and
the Abbot of Canterbury.' In a second class, a suitor can win a
lady's hand only by guessing riddles, as in our '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_46.html">Captain Wedderburn's Courtship</a>'
and '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_47.html">Proud Lady Margaret</a>.' There is
sometimes a penalty of loss of life for the unsuccessful, but not
in these ballads.

Thirdly, there is the tale (perhaps an
offshoot of an early form of the first) of The Clever Lass, who
wins a husband, and sometimes a crown, by guessing riddles,
solving difficult but practicable problems, or matching and
evading impossibilities; and of this class versions <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> of
the present ballad and <b>A-H</b> of the following are specimens.</p>

<p>Ballads like our 1, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, 2, <b>A-H</b>, are very 
common in <b>German</b>. Of the former variety 
are the following:</p>

<p><b>A</b>.
'R&auml;thsellied,' B&uuml;sching, W&ouml;chentliche Nachrichten, I, 65,
from the neighborhood of Stuttgart. The same, Erlach, in, 37;
Wunderhorn, IV, 139; Liederhort, p. 338, No 153; Erk u. Irmer, H.
5, p. 32, No 29; Mittler, No 1307 (omits the last stanza);
Zuccalmaglio, II, 574, No 317 [with change in st. 11]. A knight
meets a maid on the road, dismounts, and says, "I will ask you a
riddle; if you guess it, you shall be my wife." She answers,
"Your riddle shall soon be guessed; I will do my best to be your
wife;" guesses eight pairs of riddles, is taken up behind him,
and they ride off.

<b>B</b>.
'R&auml;thsel um R&auml;thsel,' Wunderhorn, II, 407 [429, 418] =
Erlach, I, 439. Zuccalmaglio, II, 572, No 316, rearranges, but
adds nothing. Mittler, No 1306, inserts three stanzas (7, 9, 10).
This version begins: "Maid, I will give you some riddles, and if
you guess them will marry you." There are

pairs, and, these
guessed, the man says, "I can't give you riddles; let 's marry;"
<a name="Page_I_2"/>
to which she gives no coy assent: but this conclusion is said not
to be genuine (Liederhort, p. 341, note).
<b>C</b>.
'R&auml;thsellied,' Erk, Neue Sammlung, Heft 3, p. 64, No 57, and
Liederhort, 340, No 153<sup>a</sup>, two Brandenburg versions, nearly
agreeing, one with six, the other with five, pairs of riddles. A
proper conclusion not having been obtained, the former was
completed by the two last stanzas of <b>B</b>, which are suspicious. <b>C</b>
begins like <b>B</b>.
<b>D</b>.
'R&auml;thselfragen,' Peter, Volksth&uuml;mliches aus
&Ouml;sterreichisch-Schlesien, I, 272, No 83. A knight rides by where
two maids are sitting, one of whom salutes him, the other not. He
says to the former, "I will put you three questions, and if you
can answer them will marry you." He asks three, then six more,
then three, and then two, and, all being answered, bids her,
since she is so witty, build a house on a needle's point, and put
in as many windows as there are stars in the sky; which she
parries with, "When all streams flow together, and all trees
shall fruit, and all thorns bear roses, then come for your
answer."
<b>E</b>.
'R&auml;thsellied,' Tschischka u. Schottky, Oesterreichische
Volkslieder, 2d ed., p. 28, begins like <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, has only three
pairs of riddles, and ends with the same task of building a house
on a needle's point.
<b>F</b>.
'R&auml;thsellied,' Hocker, Volkslieder von
der Mosel, in Wolf's Zeits. f&uuml;r deutsche Myth., I, 251, from
Trier, begins with the usual promise, has five pairs of riddles,
and no conclusion.
<b>G</b>.
'R&auml;thsel,' Ditfurth, Fr&auml;nkische V. L., II,
110, No 146, has the same beginning, six pairs of riddles, and
no conclusion.

</p>

<p>Some of the riddles occur in nearly all the versions, some in
only one or two, and there is now and then a variation also in
the answers. Those which are most frequent are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which is the maid without a tress? <b>A-D, G</b>.<br/>
And which is the tower without a crest? <b>A-D, F, G.</b><br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; (Maid-child in the cradle; tower of Babel.)</li>

<li>Which is the water without any sand? <b>A, B, C, F, G.</b><br/>
And which is the king without any land? <b>A, B, C, F, G.</b><br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; (Water in the eyes; king in cards.)</li>

<li>Where is no dust in all the road? <b>A-G.</b><br/>
Where is no leaf in all the wood? <b>A-G.</b><br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; (The milky way, or a river; a fir-wood.)</li>

<li>Which is the fire that never burnt? <b>A, C-G.</b><br/>
And which is the sword without a point? <b>C-G.</b><br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; (A painted fire; a broken sword.)</li>

<li>Which is the house without a mouse? <b>C-G.</b><br/>
Which is the beggar without a louse? <b>C-G.</b><br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; (A snail's house; a painted beggar.)<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d001_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></li>

<a name="Fionn"/>
<p>Among the Gaels, both Scotch and Irish, a ballad of the same
description is extremely well known. Apparently only the
questions are preserved in verse, and the connection with the
story made by a prose comment. Of these questions there is an
Irish form, dated 1738, which purports to be copied from a
manuscript of the twelfth century. Fionn would marry no lady whom
he could pose. Graidhne, "daughter of the king of the fifth of
Ullin," answered everything he asked, and became his wife.
Altogether there are thirty-two questions in the several
versions. Among them are: What is blacker than the raven? (There
is death.) What is whiter than the snow? (There is the truth.)
'Fionn's Questions,' Campbell's Popular Tales of the West
Highlands, III, 36; 'Fionn's Conversation with Ailbhe,' Heroic
Gaelic Ballads, by the same, pp. 150, 151.</p>

<p>The familiar ballad-knight of <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> is converted in <b>C</b> into an
"unco knicht," who is the devil, a departure from the proper story
which is found also in 2 <b>J</b>. The conclusion of <b>C</b>,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; As soon as she the fiend did name,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; He flew awa in a blazing flame,</p>

<p>reminds us of the behavior of trolls and nixes 
under like circumstances, but here the naming 
amounts to a detection of the Unco Knicht's 
quiddity, acts as an exorcism, and simply 
obliges the fiend to go off in his real character.
<b>D</b> belongs with <b>C</b>: it was given by the 
reciter as a colloquy between the devil and a 
maiden.</p>

<p>The earlier affinities of this ballad can be 
better shown in connection with No 2.</p>

<p>Translated, after <b>B</b> and <b>A</b>, in Grundtvig's 
Engelske og skotske Folkeviser, p. 181: Herder,
Volkslieder, I, 95, after <b>A</b> <b>d</b>.</p>
