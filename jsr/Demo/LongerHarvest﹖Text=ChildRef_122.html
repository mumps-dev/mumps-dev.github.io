<p>Other copies, of the second class, are in the Roxburghe
collection, III, 259, and the Douce collection, III, 114.
<b>B</b> <b>a</b> was printed, with changes, by Ritson, Robin
Hood, 1795, II, 23; a copy resembling the Douce by Evans, Old
Ballads, 1777, 1784, I, 106.</p>

<p>The story is a variation of Robin Hood and the Potter.
According to <b>A</b>, the sheriff of Nottingham has resolved to
have Robin's head. A butcher is driving through the forest, and
his dog flies at Robin, for which Robin kills the dog. The
butcher undertakes to let a little of the yeoman's blood for
this, and there is a bout between staff and sword, in which we
know that the butcher must bear himself well, though just here
the first of three considerable gaps occurs. Robin buys the
butcher's stock, changes clothes with him, and goes to Nottingham
to market his flesh. There he takes up his lodging at the
sheriff's, having perhaps conciliated the sheriff's wife with the
present of a fine joint. He sells at so low a rate that his stock
is all gone before any one else has sold a bit. The butchers ask
him to drink, and Robin makes an appointment with them at the
sheriff's. A second gap deprives us of the knowledge of what
passes here, but we infer that, as in <b>B</b>, Robin is so
reckless of his money that the sheriff thinks he can make a good
bargain in horned beasts with him. Robin is ready; we see that he
has come with a well-formed plan. The next day the sheriff goes
to view the livestock, and is taken into the depth of the forest;
it turns out that the wild deer are the butcher's horned beasts.
Robin's men come in at the sound of his horn; the sheriff is
lightened of all his money, and is told that his head is spared
only for his wife's sake. All this the sheriff tells his wife, on
his return, and she replies that he has been served rightly for
not tarrying at home, as she had begged him to do. The sheriff
says he has learned wisdom, and will meddle no more with Robin
Hood.</p>

<p><b>B</b> <b>a</b> omits the brush between Robin and the
butcher, mostly wanting, indeed, in <b>A</b> also, but only
because of the damage which the manuscript has suffered.</p>

<p>The passage in which the sheriff is inveigled into Robin's
haunts has, as already mentioned, close affinity with the Gest,
181 ff.</p>

<p>The first three stanzas of <b>A</b> would not be missed, and
apparently belong to some other ballad.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d122_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>B</b> <b>a</b> is signed T.R., as is also Robin Hood and
the Beggar in two editions, and these we may suppose to be the
initials of the person who wrote the story over with middle rhyme
in the third line of the stanza, a peculiarity which
distinguishes a group of ballads which were sung to the tune of
Robin Hood and the Stranger: see Robin Hood and Little John, No
125, and also No 128.</p>
