<h3>The Death of Parcy Reed</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'A song of Parcy Reed and the Three False Halls,' 
the late Robert White's papers. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d19301.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
<li>'The Death of Parcy Reed,' Richardson's Borderer's
Table Book, 1846, VII, 361; J. H. Dixon, Ancient Poems,
Ballads and Songs of the Peasantry of 
England, p. 99, Percy Society, vol. xvii, 1846. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d19302.html"><i>Version B</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Of <b>B</b>, which purports to have been taken down from an
old woman's singing by James Telfer, Mr. Robert White, from whom
I received <b>A</b>, said in a letter to Mr. J.H. Dixon: "Parcy
Reed, as you suspect, is not genuine, for it bears marks of our
friend's improvements. I have a copy of the original somewhere,
but may not be able to find it." And again, Telfer himself, "in a
letter to the late Robert Storey, the Northumbrian poet," wrote,
"I will send Mr. Dixon the real verses, but it is but a droll of
a ballad." (J.H. Dixon, in Notes and Queries, Fourth Series, J,
108, V, 520.)</p>

<p>Comparison will show that almost the whole of <b>A</b> is
preserved in <b>B</b>, and in fairly good form. <b>B</b> has also
some stanzas not found in <b>A</b> which may be accepted as
traditional. Telfer may have added a dozen of his own, and has
retouched others.</p>

<p>Mr. White, after remarking that there is no historical
evidence to show when the event on which the ballad was founded
occurred, informs us that almost every circumstance in the
narrative has been transmitted to the present century by local
tradition.</p>

<p>"Percival, or Parcy, Reed," in the words of Mr. White, "was
proprietor of Troughend, an elevated tract of land lying on the
west side and nearly in the centre of Redesdale, Northumberland.
The remains of the old tower may still be seen, a little to the
west of the present mansion, commanding a beautiful and most
extensive view of nearly the whole valley. Here he resided, and
being a keen hunter and brave soldier, he possessed much
influence, and was appointed warden or keeper of the district.
His office was to suppress and order the apprehension of thieves
and other breakers of the law; in the execution of which he
incurred the displeasure of a family of brothers of the name of
Hall, who were owners of Girsonsfield, a farm about two miles
east from Troughend. He also drew upon himself the hostility of a
band of moss troopers, Crosier by name, some of whom he had been
successful in bringing to justice. The former were, however,
artful enough to conceal their resentment, and under the ap
pearance of friendship calmly awaited an opportunity to be
avenged. Some time after wards, they solicited his attendance on
a hunt ing expedition to the head of Redesdale, and unfortunately
he agreed to accompany them. His wife had some strange dreams
anent his safety on the night before his departure, and at
breakfast, on the following morning, the loaf of bread from which
he was supplied chanced to be turned with the bottom up wards, an
omen which is still accounted most unfavorable all over the north
of England. Considering these presages undeserving of notice,
Reed set out in company with the Halls, and, after enjoying a
good day's sport, the party withdrew to a solitary hut in
Batinghope, a lonely glen stretching westward from the Whitelee,
whose little stream forms one of the chief sources of Reedwater.
The whole of this arrangement had been previously planned by the
Halls and Crosiers, and when the latter came down, late in the
evening, to execute their purpose of vengeance, they found Parcy
Reed altogether a defenceless man. His companions not only
deserted him, but had previously driven his sword so firmly in
its scabbard that it could not be drawn, and had also moistened
the powder with which the very long gun he carried with him was
charged, so as to render both useless when he came to rely upon
them for protection. Accordingly the Crosiers instantly put him
to death; and so far did they carry out their sanguinary
measures, even against his lifeless body, that tradition says the
fragments thereof had to be collected together and conveyed in
pillow-slips home to Troughend. Public indignation was speedily
aroused against the murderers; the very name of Crosier was
abhorred throughout Redesdale, and the abettors were both driven
from their residence and designated as the fause-hearted Ha's, an
appel lation which yet remains in force against them."
(Richardson's Borderer's Table Book, VII, 361.)</p>

<p>The farm of Girsonsfield, according to the ballad, <b>A</b> 3,
18, belonged to the Halls. But that place has been the property
of others, says Mr. White, "ever since the reign of Elizabeth;"
whence he concludes that the story is not to be dated later than
the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Parcy Reed is famed to have had a favorite dog named Keeldar,
and, though a "peerless archer," to have killed him by an unlucky
shot while hunting. Sir Walter Scott has celebrated this mishap
and its consequence in 'The Death of Keeldar' (Table Book, as
above, p. 240); and he alludes to the treacherous murder of Reed
(with which he became acquainted through Robert Roxby's 'Lay of
the Reedwater Minstrel,' 1809) in Rokeby, written in 1812, Canto
I, xx.</p>
