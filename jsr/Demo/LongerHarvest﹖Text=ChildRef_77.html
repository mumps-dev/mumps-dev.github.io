<p>Ramsay's copy, <b>A</b>, was reprinted by Percy, Reliques,
1765, III, 128, and by Herd, 1769, p. 194, 1776, I, 76. Percy
remarks that the concluding stanza seems modern. There can be no
doubt that both that and the one before it are modern; but, to
the extent of Margaret's dying on her lover's grave, they are
very likely to represent original verses not remembered in form.
<b>B</b> constitutes, in Herd's Manuscripts, and <b>F</b>, in
Jamieson's Popular Ballads, the termination of a copy of 'Clerk
Saunders.' Scott appended the three stanzas given as <b>G</b> to
the later edition of his <i>rifacimento</i> of the copies of
'Clerk Saunders' in Herd's Manuscripts, and says of them: "I am
informed by the reciter that it was usual to separate from the
rest that part of the ballad which follows the death of the
lovers, as belonging to another story." The first part of
<b>F</b> was evidently derived from '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_47.html">Proud Lady Margaret</a>,' No.
47.</p>

<p>Motherwell notes, Minstrelsy, p. lxiii, 6, that in recited
copies he had heard this stanza repeated, "which does not occur
in printed copies" (and can easily be spared), after <b>A</b>
14.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d077_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The story of this ballad seems to have become disordered in
most of the versions. <b>A</b> alone, the first published, has
perhaps retained the original form. The principal idea is,
however, preserved in all the full versions, <b>A</b>-<b>E</b>;
the dead lover returns to ask back his unfulfilled troth-plight.
His mistress, not knowing that he is dead, demands that he shall
first come within her bower and kiss her, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>. He answers that if he does this her days will not be
long. She persists; he shall take her to kirk,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d077_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and wed her
with a ring, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>. He then tells her distinctly
that he is dead, and she returns to him his faith and troth. She
streaks her troth on a long wand and gives it to him through a
window, <b>B</b>. In <b>A</b> she stretches out her white hand,
"to do her best;" in <b>C</b> "takes up" her white hand, and
strikes him on the breast; in <b>E</b> takes her white hand and
smooths it on his breast; all of which are possibly corruptions
of the ceremony performed in <b>B</b>. In <b>D</b> she takes a
silver key and strikes him three times on the breast. She follows
the dead till he comes to his grave, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b> (?) <b>F</b>, which is wrongly said in
<b>A</b>, <b>E</b> to be far beyond the sea. She asks if there is
room for her in his grave, and is told there is not, <b>A</b>,
<b>F</b> [there is room, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>]. She dies at his
grave, <b>A</b>; is told that her days will not be long,
<b>F</b>; in <b>G</b>, goes weeping away.</p>

<p>Margaret will not give William back his faith and troth, in
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, unless he resolves certain
questions about the state of the dead; what becomes of women that
die in travail; where the women go who hang themselves for sin;
where unbaptized children. Mere curiosity does not sort well with
this very seriously conceived ballad, and these passages have
probably grown out of a not unnatural inquiry on the part of
Margaret as to her lover's personal state, extended in <b>E</b>
12 to "tell me the pleasures o heaven, and pains o hell how they
be." The scene at the grave in <b>C</b> 11-13 may be judged
grotesque, but is not trivial or unimpressive. These verses may
be supposed not to have belonged to the earliest form of the
ballad, and one does not miss them from <b>A</b>, but they cannot
be an accretion of modern date.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott informs us, in the Advertisement to The
Pirate, that the lady whose affections had been engaged by Goff,
the historical prototype of Cleveland, "went up to London to see
him before his death, and that, arriving too late, she had the
courage to request a sight of his body; and then touching the
hand of the corpse, she formally resumed the troth-plight which
she had bestowed." "Without going through this ceremony," Scott
goes on to say, "she could not, according to the superstition of
the country, have escaped a visit from the ghost of her departed
lover, in the event of her bestowing upon any living suitor the
faith which she had plighted to the dead."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d077_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>'Sweet William's Ghost' has much in common with one of the
most beautiful and celebrated of the Scandinavian ballads, and
may well be a different development of the same story:</p>

<p><b>Danish</b>. 'F&aelig;stemanden i Graven' ('Aage og Else'),
Grundtvig, No 90, II, 492-97, III, 870-74, <b>A</b> from a
manuscript of the seventeenth century, <b>B</b> from about 1700,
<b>C</b> from recent tradition. <b>Swedish</b>. 'Sorgens Magt,'
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, Afzelius, No 6, I, 29, II, 204; <b>C</b>,
Arwidsson, No 91, II, 103; <b>D</b>, Wigstr&ouml;m, Sk&aring;nska
Visor, No 8, the same, Folkdiktning, I, 17, No 6, 'Den dode
brudgummen:' all from recent tradition.</p>

<p>According to the oldest version, Danish <b>A</b>,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d077_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> from
which the others do not materially vary, a man dies just as he is
to be married. His love grieves for him passionately. The dead
hears her under the ground, comes to her bower with his coffin on
his back, and knocks. She lets him in after he has proved himself
to be "a spirit of health" by uttering the name of Jesus, combs
his hair, and asks him how it is under the black earth (cf.
English, <b>E</b> 12). It is like the bliss of heaven. May she
follow him into his grave? It is like blackest hell. Every time
she weeps for him his coffin is filled with lappered blood. But
when she sings and is happy, his grave is all hung with
rose-leaves. The cock crows, the white, the red, the black; he
takes up his coffin and goes wearily back to the graveyard. His
love follows through the mirk wood (so Swedish <b>A</b> 9, cf.
English <b>B</b> 11), to the churchyard, and into the church.
Then his yellow hair falls away, his rosy color wans. He bids her
go home and never weep for him more. "Look up at the sky, the
night is going;" and as she looks he slips into his grave. She
goes sadly home, prays God that she may not live out a year and a
day, falls sick, and dies within a month.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian ballad agrees in many particulars with the
conclusion of the second lay of Helgi Hundingsbani in the older
Edda. Helgi, having been slain by Sigr&uacute;n's brother, is
bitterly be wailed by Sigr&uacute;n. He quits his barrow to come
to her. Sigr&uacute;n will kiss him, but his hair is thick with
hoar-frost, he is drenched in blood, and how is this? These are
the grim tears that Sigr&uacute;n has shed, every one of which
falls on his breast. Sigr&uacute;n says she will sleep in his
arms as though he were alive, and goes into the barrow with him.
The end of the story is lost; according to a prose tradition
which professes to supply the close, Sigr&uacute;n soon died of
grief. The source of the later ballads is perceptible here.</p>

<p>In the English ballad the dead lover returns of his own
motion, simply to ask back his troth; in the Scandinavian, his
betrothed grieves him out of his grave, "hon s&ouml;rjer sin
f&auml;steman ur graf,' and the object of his visit is to
admonish her to restrain her tears, which prevent his happy
repose. A fragmentary story with this turn, which perhaps may
even have been a variety of 'Sweet William's Ghost,' will be
found in the ballad which fol- lows this.</p>

<p>In a somewhat popular German ballad, 'Der todte Freier,' a
dead man comes to the window of his betrothed in the night and
calls her. She does not recognize him; says he smells of the
ground. He has been eight years in the ground, and that may be.
He bids her summon father, mother, and friends, for her
bridegroom has come. She is decked as for her wedding; at the
first sound of the bell makes her will or receives the sacrament,
and dies at the second.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d077_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A young man goes to the grave of his betrothed and asks his
love-tokens back; she refers him to her mother, and tells him she
will join him in a year: Haupt u. Schmaler, I, 88, No 55. This
returning of gifts by the dead is not an infrequent phenomenon:
