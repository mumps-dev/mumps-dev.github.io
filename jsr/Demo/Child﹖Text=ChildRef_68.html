<p><b>J</b>, Scott's version, and naturally the best known, is
described by the editor as made up from the best verses of Herd's
copies, <b>A</b>, <b>G</b>, with some trivial alterations adopted
from tradition. This account is far from being exact, for there
are many lines in the edition of 1802 which are not found in
Herd's copies, and in the edition of 1833 four additional
stanzas, 11, 12, 13, 28. Such portions of Scott's version as are
not found in Herd are here distinguished by a larger type.
<b>K</b> is perhaps a stall copy, and certainly, where it is not
taken from other versions, is to a considerable degree a modern
manufacture by a very silly pen.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d068_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The copy in Pinkerton's Tragic Ballads, p. 84, is only the
first five stanzas of <b>G</b>, a little altered.</p>

<p>A Scandinavian ballad begins somewhat like 'Young Hunting,'
but ends like 'Elveskud' or 'Clerk Colvil.' A young man who has
made up his mind to marry is warned by his mother against the
wiles of a former mistress. He rides to his old love's honse and
is welcomed to beer and wine. He tells her that he is on the way
to his bride. She wants a word with him, or a kiss, and as he
leans over to her on his horse, stabs him to the heart. He rides
home bleeding, pretends that he has hurt himself by running
against a tree, asks that his bed may be made and a priest sent
for, and dies. <b>Danish</b>, 'Frillens H&aelig;vn,' Grundtvig,
IV, 203 f, No 208, <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>, <b>A</b> from a manuscript
of the 17th century. <b>Swedish</b>, <b>A</b>, 'Herr Magnus,'
Afzelius, No 13, I, 67, an imperfect copy; <b>B</b>, from
Cavallius and Stephens' manuscript collection, <b>C</b>-<b>H</b>,
fragments in the same collection, Grundtvig, IV, 203; <b>I</b>,
'Herr Samsing,' Eva Wigstr&ouml;m, in Hazelius, Ur de nordiska
Folkens Lif, p. 124. <b>Norwegian</b>, 'Herre Per og
Gj&ouml;&eth;alin,' a mixed form, Landstad, p. 564, No 68, and
the first stanza in Lindeman, No 132, No 178.</p>

<p>The place where the dead body of the knight lies at the bottom
of the river is discovered by candles burning bright, <b>A</b> 22
f, <b>C</b> 19 f, <b>H</b> 8, <b>K</b> 31, 35. Sir Walter Scott
supposed these candles to mean "the corpse-lights ... which are
sometimes seen to illuminate the spot where a dead body is
concealed." He had been informed that the body of a man drowned
in the Ettrick had been discovered by means of these candles.
Though the language in the ballad is not quite explicit, owing
perhaps to the fact that the method of detection practised was
more familiar formerly than now, the meaning is as likely to be
that a candle, floated on the water, would burn brighter when it
came to the spot where the body lay. A candle (a consecrated one
in Catholic countries) stuck in a loaf of bread, or supported by
cork, is still believed to be efficient for indicating the place
of a drowned body; in England, Henderson, Notes on the Folk Lore
of the Northern Counties, ed. 1879, p. 60; in Bohemia, Wuttke,
Deutscher Volksaberglaube der Gegenwart, ed. 1869, p. 239, No
371; in Brittany, Bl&auml;tter f&uuml;r literarische
Unterhaltung, 1837, p. 892; in Portugal, Vasconcellos,

<p>That the body of a murdered man will emit blood upon being
touched, or even approached, by the murderer is a belief of
ancient standing, and evidence of this character was formerly
admitted in judicial investigations. See especially Grimm,
Rechtsalterth&uuml;mer, 1854, p, 930 f, Bahrgericht, who cites
from literature the Nibelungenlied (1043-45, Bartsch) Hartmann's
Iwein, 1355-64, Shakespeare's Richard III, I, 2, besides
instances of legal or historical description; to which may be
added others furnished by Sir W. Scott, Minstrelsy III, 190-83,
ed. 1833, and Kinloch, Ancient Scottish Ballads, pp 10-12. See
further Schmidt, Die M&auml;rchen des Straparola, pp 229, 346 ff,
Holinshed's Chronicle of Scotland, p. 235, ed. 1808, Matthew
Paris, Chronica Majora, ed. Luard, II, 344 f, Brand's
Antiquities, ed. Ellis, II, 542-44.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d068_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>There is a sort of <i>judicium ignis</i> in <b>A</b> 26-28,
<b>B</b> 23 f, <b>C</b> 24, <b>K</b> 37 f: the fire which does
not burn the innocent bower-woman consumes her guilty
mistress.</p>

and corn, <b>G</b> 7, thorn, <b>K</b> 26, see '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_67.html">Glasgerion</a>.'</p>
