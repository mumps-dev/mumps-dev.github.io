<h3>Glossary</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding every effort to make this glossary as complete
as possible, there remain not a few words and phrases with which
I can do nothing satisfactory. This is the case not only with
ballads from recent tradition, but with some that were taken down
in writing three hundred years ago or more.</p>

<p>At every stage of oral transmission we must suppose that some
accidental variations from what was delivered would be
introduced, and occasionally some wilful variations. Memory will
fail at times; at times the listener will hear amiss, or will not
understand, and a perversion of sense will ensue, or absolute
nonsense, nonsense which will be servilely repeated, and which
repetition may make more gross. Dr. Davidson informs me that one
of his female relatives rendered 'an echo shrill did make' (in
Chevy Chace, 10) 'an achish yirl did make,' and that he took
'aching or frightened earl' to be the meaning until he read the
piece. Happy are we when we are sure of the nonsense; as when, in
The Gypsy Laddie, 'they cast their glamourie owre her' is turned
into 'they called their grandmother over.' "The combination of
two words into one," says Dr. Davidson, "is not rare in Scotch,
nor is the reverse process. For example, the word 'hypochondriac'
is turned into 'keepach and dreeach,' and the two parts often
used separately. 'I'm unco keepach' and 'I'm unco dreeach' are
common expressions among old people. Imagine an etymologist,
ignorant of the facts, trying to discover the etymology of
'keepach' or of 'dreeach.'" Words of one or two syllables are
long enough for the simple; a laboring man of my acquaintance
calls rheumatism 'the tisrn': what are the other syllables to
such, who understand no one of the three? Learned words do not
occur in ballads; still an old native word will be in the same
danger of metamorphosis. But, though unfamiliarity naturally ends
in corruption, mishearing may have the like effect where the
original phrase is in no way in fault; hence, perhaps, 'with a
bretther a degs ye'll clear up my nags,' 'a tabean briben kame,'
'I'll have that head of thine, to enter plea att my iollye,'
etc.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, however, that as to nonsense the
burden of proof rests always upon the expositor. His personal
inability to dispose of a reading is not conclusive; his
convictions may be strong, but patience and caution are his part
and self-restraint as to conjectures.</p>

<p>It is with a strong feeling of what 'a kindly Scot' signifies
that I offer my thanks to many gentlemen who have favored me with
comments on lists of words submitted to them. Especial
acknowledgment is due to Dr. Thomas Davidson, a native of Old
Deer, who has made his home in the United States, and to Mr.
William Walker, of Aberdeen. Besides these, I have to mention
with gratitude the Rev. Robert Lippe, Rev. Dr. Walter Gregor, the
late Dr. William Alexander, Principal Sir W.D. Geddes, Dr. James
Mori, Messrs. William Forbes, James Aiken, David Scott, W.
Carnie, W. Cadenhead, and William Murison, all of Aberdeenshire;
Dr. James Burgess, Messrs. J. Logic Robertson and William
Macmath, of Edinburgh; Professor A.F. Murison, of London, and Dr.
Robert Wallace, M.P.; Professor James Cappen, Queen's University,
Kingston, Ontario; Rev. Professor J. Clarke Murray and Principal
Dr. W.M. Barbour, of Montreal; Rev. Dr. Alexander McDonald, St.
Francis Xavier's College, Antigonish, N.S.; Rev. Dr. Waters, of
Newark, N.J. For some difficult English words help has been given
by Dr. W. Hand Browne of Johns Hopkins University, Professor
Manly of Brown University, and Professor Kittredge of Harvard
College.</p>

<p>It will be observed that ballads in the Skene Manuscript which
were derived from the "Old Lady's Collection" are not glossed,
but the originals, which should be substituted for Skene's more
or less incorrect copies.</p>

<p>[References are usually to volume, page, and stanza.]</p>
