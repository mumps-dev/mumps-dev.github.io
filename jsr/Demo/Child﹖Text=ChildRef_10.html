<p>This is one of the very few old ballads which are not extinct
as tradition in the British Isles. Even drawing-room versions are
spoken of as current, "generally traced to some old nurse, who
sang them to the young ladies."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It has been found in
England, Scotland,
<a name="Page_I_119"/>
Wales, and Ireland, and was very early in
print. Dr. Rimbaulfc possessed and published a broadside of the
date 1656<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> (<b>A</b> <b>a</b>), and the same copy is included
in the miscellany called Wit Restor'd, 1658. Both of these name
"Mr. Smith" as the author; that is, Dr. James Smith, a well-known
writer of humorous verses, to whom the larger part of the pieces
in Wit Restor'd has been attributed. If the ballad were ever in
Smith's hands, he might possibly have inserted the three
burlesque stanzas, 11-13; but similar verses are found in another
copy (<b>L</b> <b>a</b>), and might easily be extemporized by any
singer of sufficiently bad taste. Wit and Drollery, the edition
of 1682, has an almost identical copy of the ballad, and this is
repeated in Dryden's Miscellany, edition of 1716, Part III, p.
316. In 1781 Pinkerton inserted in his Tragic Ballads one with
the title 'Binnorie,' purporting to be from Scottish tradition. Of
twenty-eight couplets, barely seven are genuine. Scott printed in
1802 a copy (<b>C</b>) compounded from one "in Mrs. Brown's
Manuscript" (<b>B</b> <b>b</b>) and a fragment of fourteen
stanzas which had been transcribed from recitation by Miss
Charlotte Brooke, adopting a burden found in neither,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
Jamieson followed, four years after, with a tolerably faithful,
though not, as he says, verbatim, publication of his copy of Mrs.
Brown's ballad, somewhat marred, too, by acknowledged
interpolations. This text of Mrs. Brown's is now correctly given,
with the whole or fragments of eleven others, hitherto
unpublished.</p>

<p>The ballad is as popular with the Scandinavians as with their
Saxon cousins. Grundtvig, 'Den talende Strengeleg,' No 95, gives
nine Danish versions and one stanza of a tenth; seven,
<b>A</b>-<b>B</b>, in II, 507 ff, the remainder,
<b>H</b>-<b>K</b>, in III, 875 ff. One more, <b>L</b>, is added
by Kristensen, No 96, I, 253. Of these, only <b>E</b> had been
previously printed. All are from tradition of this century.</p>

<p>There are two Icelandic versions, <b>A</b> from 
the 17th, <b>B</b> from the 19th, century, printed 
in &Iacute;slenzk Fornkv&aelig;&eth;i, No 13, 'H&ouml;rpu 
kv&aelig;&eth;i.'</p>

<p>Of twelve Norwegian versions, A<b>,</b> by Moe, "is printed in
Norske Universitets og Skole-Annaler for 1850, p. 287," and in
Moe's Samlede Skrifter, II, 118, 'Dae bur ein Mann h&aelig;er
utm&aelig; Aa;' <b>B</b>, by Lindeman, Annaler, as before, "p.
496," and in his Norske Fjeldmelodier, vol. I, Tekst-Bilag, p. 4,
No 14, 'Dei tv&aelig;e Systa; ' <b>C</b>, by Landstad, 'Dei tvo
systar,' No 53, p. 480; <b>D</b>-<b>L</b> are described by
Professor Bugge in Grundtvig, III, 877 f; <b>M</b> "is printed in
Illustreret Nyhedsblads Nytaarsgave for 1860, p. 77,
Christiania."</p>

<p>Four F&auml;r&ouml;e versions are known: <b>A</b>,
'Horpurima,'."in Svabo's Manuscript, No 16, I, 291," incorrectly
printed by Afzelius, I, 86, and accurately, from a copy furnished
by Grundtvig, in Bergstr&ouml;m's edition of Afzelius, II, 69;
<b>B</b>, a compound of two versions taken down by Pastor Lyngbye
and by Pastor Schroter, in Nyeste Skilderie af Kj&oslash;benhavn,
1821, col. 997 ff; <b>C</b>, a transcript from recitation by
Hammershaimb (Grundtvig); <b>D</b>, 'in Fugloyjarb&oacute;k, No
31."</p>

<p>Swedish versions are: <b>A</b>, 'Den underbara Harpan,'
Afzelius, No 17, I, 81, new ed., No 16, i, I, 72: <b>B</b>, 'De
tva Systrarne,' Afzelius, No 69, in, 16, new ed., No 16, 2, i,
74: <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, imprinted copies in Cavallius
and Stephens's collection: <b>F</b>, 'De tva Systrarne,'
Arwidsson, No 99, II, 139: <b>G</b>, 'Systermordet,' <b>E</b>.
Wigstr&ouml;m, Skanska Visor, p. 4, and the same, Folkdiktning,
etc., No 7, p. 19: <b>H</b>,
<a name="Page_I_120"/>
Rancken, N&aring;gra Prof af
Folks&aring;ng, No 3, p. 10. Afzelius, moreover, gives variations
from four other copies which he had collected, in, 20 if, new
ed., II, 74 ff; and Rancken from three others. Both of the
editors of the new Afzelius have recently obtained excellent
copies from singers. The ballad has also been found in Finnish,
Bergstr&ouml;m's Afzelius, II, 79.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable agreement between the Norse and English
ballads till we approach the conclusion of the story, with a
natural diversity as to some of the minuter details.</p>

<p>The sisters are king's daughters in English <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>O</b>(?), <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>,
<b>R</b> <b>a</b>, and in Swedish <b>B</b> and two others of
Afzelius's versions. They are an earl's daughters in Swedish
<b>F</b>, and sink to farmer's daughters in English <b>R</b>
<b>b</b>, <b>c</b>,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>G</b>, Norwegian
<b>C</b>.</p>

<p>It is a thing made much of in most of the Norse ballads that
the younger sister is fair and the older dark; the younger is
bright as the sun, as white as ermine or as milk, the elder black
as soot, black as the earth, Icelandic <b>A</b>, Swedish
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>G</b>, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, etc.;
and this difference is often made the ground for very unhandsome
taunts, which qualify our compassion for the younger; such as
Wash all day, and you will be no whiter than God made you, Wash
as white as you please, you will never get a lover,
F&auml;r&uml;oe <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>
etc. This contrast may possibly be implied in "the youngest was
the fairest flower," English <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>Q</b>
["sweetest," <b>D</b>], but is expressed only in <b>M</b>, "Ye
was fair and I was din" (dun), and in <b>P</b> <b>a</b>, "The old
was black and the young ane fair."</p>

<p>The scene of action is a seashore in Icelandic and
F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, Swedish
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, and in all the Danish
complete copies: a seashore, or a place where ships come in, in
English <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> <b>a</b>, <b>D</b>-<b>I</b>, <b>Q</b>,
<b>R</b> <b>a</b>, <b>T</b>, but in all save the last of these
(the last is only one stanza) we have the absurdity of a body
drowned in navigable water being discovered floating down a
mill-stream.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> <b>B</b> <b>c</b> has "the deep mill-dam;"
<b>C</b> "the river-strand," perhaps one of Scott's changes;
<b>M</b>, "the dams;" <b>L</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>R</b>
<b>b</b> <b>c</b>, a river, Tweed mill-clam, or the water of
Tweed. Norwegian <b>B</b> has a river.</p>

<p>The pretence for the older sister's taking the younger down to
the water is in English <b>A</b>-<b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>Q</b>, to see their father's ships come
in; in Icelandic <b>B</b> to wash their silks;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> <b>J</b> in most
of the Norse ballads to wash themselves, so that, as the elder
says, "we may be alike white," Danish <b>C</b>-<b>H</b>,
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, Swedish <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>,
F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. Malice prepense is attributed
to the elder in Swedish <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, Norwegian <b>C</b>,
Danish <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>: but in F&auml;r&ouml;e
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and perhaps
some other cases, a previous evil intent is not certain, and the
provocations of the younger sister may excuse the elder so
far.</p>

<p>The younger is pushed from a stone upon which she sits,
stands, or steps, in English <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>B</b>-<b>H</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>Q</b>, Icelandic
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, Norwegian
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, Danish <b>A</b>-<b>E</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>L</b>, Swedish <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, and Rancken's other
copies.</p>

<p>The drowning scene is the same in all the ballads, except as
to one point. The younger sister, to save her life, offers or
consents to renounce her lover in the larger number, as English
<b>B</b>-<b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>M</b>,
<b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, Danish <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>I</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>; and in
Icelandic <b>B</b> and "all the F&auml;r&ouml;e" ballads she
finally yields, after first saying that her lover must dispose of
himself. But Swedish <b>F</b>, with more spirit, makes the girl,
after promising everything else, reply:</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Help then who can, help God above!<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But ne'er shalt thou get my dear true-love.'</p>

<p>In this refusal concur Icelandic <b>A</b>, Danish <b>E</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, and all the Norwegian versions except
<b>L</b>.</p>

<p>Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>G</b>, and Rancken's versions (or
<a name="Page_I_121"/>
two of
them) make the younger sister, when she sees that she must drown,
send greetings to her father, mother, true-love [also brother,
sister, Rancken] , and^ add in each case that she is drinking, or
dancing, her bridal in the flood, that her bridal-bed is made on
the white-sand, etc.</p>

<p>The body of the drowned girl is discovered, in nearly all the
English ballads, by some member of the miller's household, and is
taken out of the water by the miller. In <b>L</b> <b>b</b>,
which, however, is imperfect at the beginning, a harper finds the
body. In the Icelandic ballads it is found on the seashore by the
lover; in all the Norwegian but <b>M</b> by two fishermen, as
also in Swedish <b>D</b> [fishermen in Swedish <b>B</b>]; in all
the F&auml;r&ouml;e versions and Norwegian <b>M</b> by two
"pilgrims;"<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in Danish <b>A</b>-<b>F</b>, <b>L</b>, and
Swedish <b>C</b> by two musicians, Danish <b>H</b>, Swedish
<b>A</b>, <b>G</b>, one. Danish <b>G</b>, which is corrupted at
the close, has three musicians, but these simply witness and
report the drowning.</p>

<p>According to all complete and uncorrupted forms of the ballad,
either some part of the body of the drowned girl is taken to
furnish a musical instrument, a harp or a viol,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> or the
instrument is wholly made from the body. This is done in the
Norse ballads by those who first find the body, save in Swedish
<b>B</b>, where fishermen draw the body ashore, and a passing
"speleman" makes the instrument. In English it is done by the
miller, <b>A</b>; by a harper, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>L</b> <b>b</b> (the Icing's harper in <b>B</b>); by a fiddler,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b> <b>a</b>(?), <b>O</b>,
<b>P</b> (the king's fiddler, <b>O</b>(?), <b>P</b>); by both a
fiddler and the king's harper, <b>H</b>; in <b>F</b> by the
father's herds man, who happens to be a fiddler.</p>

<p>Perhaps the original conception was the simple and beautiful
one which we find in English <b>B</b> and both the Icelandic
ballads, that the king's harper, or the girl's lover, takes three
locks of her yellow hair to string his harp with. So we find
three tets of hair in <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, and three
links in <b>F</b>, <b>P</b>, used, or directed to be used, to
string the fiddle or the fiddle-bow, and the same, apparently,
with Danish <b>A</b>. Infelicitous additions were, perhaps,
successively made; as a harp-frame from the breast bone in
English <b>C</b>, and fiddle-pins formed of the finger-joints,
English <b>F</b>, <b>O</b>, Danish <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>, <b>L</b>. Then we have all three: the frame of the
instrument formed from the breast (or trunk), the screws from the
finger-joints, the strings from the hair, Swedish <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>G</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>M</b>. And
so one thing and another is added, or substituted, as fiddle-bows
of the arms or legs, Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, Danish <b>H</b>,
English <b>L</b> <b>a</b>; a harp-frame from the arms, Norwegian
<b>B</b>, F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>A</b>; a fiddle-frame from the
skull, Swedish <b>C</b>, or from the back-bone, English <b>L</b>
<b>b</b>; a <i>plectrum</i> from the arm, F&auml;r&ouml;e
<b>B</b>; strings from the veins, English <b>A</b>; a bridge from
the nose, English <b>A</b>, <b>L</b> <b>a</b>;
"h&oslash;rp&oslash;nota" from the teeth, Norwegian <b>B</b>;
till we end with the buffoonery of English <b>A</b> and <b>L</b>
<b>a</b>.</p>

<p>Swedish <b>H</b> has nothing about the finding of the body.
Music is wanted for the bridal, and a man from another village,
who undertakes to furnish it, looks three days for a proper tree
to make a harp of. The singer of this version supplied the
information, lost from the ballad, that the drowned sister had
floated ashore and grown up into a linden, and that this was the
very tree which was chosen for the harp. (See, further on, a
Lithuanian, a Slovak, and an Esthonian ballad.)</p>

<p>All the Norse ballads make the harp or fiddle to be taken to a
wedding, which chances to be that of the elder sister with the
drowned girl's betrothed.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Unfortunately, many of the
<a name="Page_I_122"/>
English
versions are so injured towards the close that the full story
cannot be made out. There is no wedding-feast preserved in any of
them. The instrument, in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>,
is taken into the king's presence. The viol in <b>A</b> and the
harp in <b>H</b> are expressly said to speak. The harp is laid
upon a stone in <b>C</b>, <b>J</b>, and plays "its lone;" the
fiddle plays of itself in <b>L</b> <b>b</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> <b>B</b> makes
the harper play, and <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>O</b>,
which say the fiddle played, probably mean that there was a
fiddler, and so perhaps with all the Norse versions; but this is
not very material, since in either case the instrument speaks
"with most miraculous organ."</p>

<p>There are three strings made from the girl's hair in Icelandic
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, English <b>B</b> [veins, English <b>A</b>],
and the three tets or links in English <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>P</b> were no doubt taken to make three
strings originally. Corresponding to this are three enunciations
of the instrument in English <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
Icelandic <b>A</b>, F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>A</b>,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> <b>B</b>,
Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>. These
are reduced to two in Icelandic <b>B</b>, Danish <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, Swedish <b>D</b>, and even to one
in English <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>O</b>, but
some of these have suffered injury towards the conclusion. The
number is increased to four in Norwegian <b>B</b>, to five in
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, and even to six in Norwegian
<b>C</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>M</b>. The increase is, of course, a later
exaggeration, and very detrimental to the effect. In those
English copies in which the instrument speaks but once,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
<b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>O</b>, and we may add <b>P</b>,
it expresses a desire for vengeance: Hang my sister, <b>D</b>,
<b>F</b>, <b>K</b>; Ye'll drown my sister, as she 's dune me,
<b>O</b>; Tell him to burn my sister, <b>P</b>. This is found in
no Norse ballad, neither is it found in the earliest English
versions. These, and the better forms of the Norse, reveal the
awful secret, directly or indirectly, and, in the latter case,
sometimes note the effect on the bride. Thus, in Icelandic
<b>B</b>, the first string sounds, The bride is our sister; the
second, The bride is our murderer. In Danish B the first fiddle
plays, The bride is my sister; the second, The bridegroom is my
true-love; in <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, the first strain is, The bride
has drowned her sister, the second, Thy sister is driven [blown]
to land. F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, have: (1) The bride
was my sister; (2) The bride was my murderer; (3) The bridegroom
was my true-love. The bride then says that the harp disturbs her
much, and that she lists to hear it no more. Most impressive of
all, with its terse, short lines, is Icelandic <b>A</b>:</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first string made response:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The bride was my sister once.'</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bride on the bench, she spake:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The harp much trouble doth make.'</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second string answered the other:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'She is parting me and my lover.'</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Answered the bride, red as gore:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The harp is vexing us sore.'</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The canny third string replied:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I owe my death to the bride.'</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He made all the harp-strings clang;<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bride's heart burst with the pang.</p>

<p>This is the wicked sister's end in both of the Icelandic
ballads and in F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. In Swedish
<b>A</b>, <b>G</b>, at the first stroke on the harp she laughs;
at the second she grows pale [has to be undressed]; upon the
third she lay dead in her bed [falls dead on the floor]. She is
burned in Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>G</b>, Swedish <b>B</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>M</b>. In Norwegian <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>,
the younger sister (who is restored to life) begs that the elder
may not be burned, but sent out of the country (cf. English
<b>B</b> <b>b</b> <b>c</b>); nevertheless, she is buried alive in
<b>L</b>, which is her fate also in <b>E</b>, and in other
unprinted versions. A prose comment, upon Danish <b>I</b> has her
stabbed by the bridegroom.</p>

<a name="Page_I_123"/>
<p>Norwegian <b>B</b> 21 makes the bride, in her confusion at the
revelations of the harp, ask the bridegroom to drive the fiddler
out of the house. So far from complying, the bride groom orders
him mead and wine, and the bride to the pile. In Norwegian
<b>C</b> the bride treads on the harper's foot, then orders the
playing to stop; but the bridegroom springs from the table, and
cries, Let the harp have its song out, pays no regard to the
lady's alleging that she has so bad a head that she cannot bear
it, and finally sends her to the pile. So, nearly, Norwegian
<b>A</b>. In Danish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>L</b>, vainly in the first two, the bride tries to hush the
fiddler with a bribe. He endeavors to take back what he has said
in <b>D</b>, <b>L</b>, declaring him self a drunken fool (the
passage is borrowed from another ballad): still in L, though suc
cessful for the nonce, she comes to the stake and wheel some
months after. In <b>H</b> the fiddler dashes the instrument
against a stone, seemingly to earn his bribe, but this trait
belongs to versions which take the turn of the Norwegian. In
<b>C</b> 15 the bride springs from the table, and says, Give the
fiddlers a trifle, and let them go. This explains the last stanza
of English <b>A</b> (cf., Norwegian <b>B</b> 21):</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now pay the miller for his payne,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And let him bee gone in the divel's name.</p>

<p>Swedish <b>F</b> has an entirely perverted and feeble
conclusion. "A good man" takes the younger sister from the water,
carries her to his house, revives her, and nurses her till the
morrow, and then restores her to her father, who asks why she is
so pale, and why she had not come back with her sister. She
explains that she had been pushed into the water, "and we may
thank this good man that I came home at all." The father tells
the elder that she is a disgrace to her country, and condemns her
to the "blue tower." But her sister intercedes, and a cheerful
and handsome wedding follows.</p>

<p>Swedish C and nearly all the Norwegian ballads<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> restore
the drowned girl to life, but not by those processes of the
Humane Society which are successfully adopted by the "arlig man"
in Swedish <b>F</b>. The harp is dashed against a stone, or upon
the floor, and the girl stands forth "as good as ever." As
Landstad conceives the matter (484, note 7), the elder sister is
a witch, and is in the end burned as such. The white body of the
younger is made to take on the appearance of a crooked log, which
the fishermen (who, by the way, are angels in <b>C</b>, <b>B</b>)
innocently shape into a harp, and the music, vibrating from her
hair "through all her limbs, marrow and bone," acts as a
disenchantment. However this may be, the restoration of the
younger sister, like all good endings foisted on tragedies,
emasculates the story.</p>

<p>English <b>F</b> 9 has the peculiarity, not noticed elsewhere,
that the drowning girl catches at a broom-root, and the elder
sister forces her to let go her hold.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In Swedish <b>G</b>
she is simply said to swim to an alder-root. In English <b>G</b>
8 the elder drives the younger from the land with a switch, in
<b>I</b> 8 pushes her off with a silver wand.</p>

<p>English <b>O</b> introduces the ghost of the drowned sister as
instructing her father's fiddler to make a string of her hair and
a peg of her little finger bone, which done, the first spring the
fiddle plays, it says,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Ye'll drown my sister as she 's dune me.'</p>

<p><b>P</b>, which is disordered at the end, seems to have agreed
with <b>O</b>. In <b>Q</b> the ghost sends, by the medium of the
miller and his daughter, respects to father, mother, and
true-love, adding a lock of yellow hair for the last. The ghost
is found in <b>N</b>, Pinkerton's copy, as well, but there
appears to the lover at dead of night, two days after the
drowning. It informs him of the murder, and he makes search for
the body. This is a wide departure from the original story, and
plainly a modern per version. Another variation, entirely wanting
<a name="Page_I_124"/>
in ancient authority, appears in <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>. The girl is
not dead when she has floated down to the mill-dam, and, being
drawn out of the water by the miller, offers him a handsome
reward to take her back to her father [<b>S</b>, to throw her in
again!]. The miller takes the reward, and pushes the girl in
again, for which he is hanged.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>Q</b> has a burden partly Gaelic,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .... ohone and aree (alack and O Lord),<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the banks of tlhe Banna (White Kiver),<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ohone and aree,</p>

<p>which may raise a question whether the Scotch burden Binnorie
(pronounced B&iacute;nnorie, as well as Binn&oacute;rie) is
corrupted from it, or the corruption is on the other side. Mr.
Campbell notices as quaint the reply in stanza 9:</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I did not put you in with the design<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just for to pull you out again.'</p>

<p>We have had a similar reply, made under like circumstances, in
Polish versions of No 4: see p. 40, note.</p>

<p>All the Norse versions of this ballad are in two-line stanzas,
and all the English, except <b>L</b> <b>b</b> and in part
<b>L</b> <b>a</b>.</p>

<p>Some of the traits of the English and Norse 
story are presented by an Esthonian ballad, 
'The Harp,' Neus, Ehstnische Volkslieder, No 
13, p. 56. Another version is given in Rosenpl&auml;nter's Beitrage zur genauern Kenntniss 
der ehstnischen Sprache, Heft 4, 142, and a 
third, says Neus, in Ch. H.J. Schlegel's Reisen 
in mehrere russische Gouvernements, V, 140. 
A young woman, who tells her own story, is 
murdered by her sisters-in-law and buried in 
a moor. She comes up as a birch, from which, 
with the jaw-bone of a salmon, the teeth of a 
pike, and her own hair (the account is some 
what confused) a harp is made. The harp is 
taken to the hall by the murdered girl's brother, and responds to his playing with tones of 
sorrow like those of the bride who leaves father and mother for the house of a 
husband.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_016','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A Slovak ballad often translated (Talvj, Historical View,
etc., p. 392; Wenzig's Slawische Volkslieder, p. 110,
Westslawischer Marchenschatz, 273, and Bibliothek Slavischer
Poesien, p. 134; Lewestam, Polnische Volksagen und Marchen, p.
151) comes nearer in some respects. A daughter is cursed by her
mother for not succeeding in drawing water in frosty weather. Her
bucket turns to stone, but she to a maple. Two fiddlers come by,
and, seeing a remarkably fine tree, propose to make of it fiddles
and fiddle-sticks. When they cut into the tree, blood spirts out.
The tree bids them go on, and when they have done, play before
the mother's door, and sing, Here is your daughter, that you
cursed to stone. At the first notes the mother runs to the
window, and begs them to desist, for she has suffered much since
she lost her daughter.</p>

<p>The soul of a dead girl speaks through a tree, again, in a
Lithuanian ballad, Nesselmann, Littauische Volkslieder, No 378,
p. 320. The girl is drowned while attempting to cross a stream,
carried down to the sea, and finally thrown ashore, where she
grows up a linden. Her brother makes a pipe from a branch, and
the pipe gives out sweet, sad tones. The mother says, That tone
conies not from the linden; it is thy sister's soul, that hovers
over the water. A like idea is met with in another Lithuanian
ballad, Rhesa, Dainos, ed. Kurschat, No 85, p. 231. A sister
plucks a bud from a rose-bush growing over the grave of her
brother, who had died from disappointed love. How fragrant ! she
exclaims. But her mother answers, with tears, It is not the rose
bud, but the soul of the youth that died of grief.</p>

<p>Though the range of the ballad proper is somewhat limited,
popular tales equivalent as to the characteristic circumstances
are very widely diffused.</p>

<p>A Polish popular tale, which is, indeed, half song, Wojcicki,
Klechdy, ed. 1851, II, 15 (Lewestam, p. 105), Kolberg, Piesni
ludu
<a name="Page_I_125"/>
Polskiego, p. 292, No 40 <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>,
approaches very close to the English-Norse ballad. There were
three sisters, all pretty, but the youngest far surpassing the
others. A young man from the far-off Ukraine fell in with them
while they were making garlands. The youngest pleased him best,
and he chose her for his wife. This excited the jealousy of the
eldest, and a few days after, when they were gather ing berries
in a wood, she killed the youngest, notwithstanding the
resistance of the second sister, buried her, and gave out that
she had been torn to pieces by wolves. When the youth came to ask
after his love, the murderess told him this tale, and so won him
by her devoted consolations that he offered her his hand. A
willow grew out of the grave of the youngest, and a herdsman made
a pipe from one of its boughs. Blow as he would, he could get no
sound from the pipe but this:</p>

<p>'Blow on, herdsman, blow ! God shall bless thee so.<br/>
The eldest was my slayer, the second tried to stay her.'</p>

<p>The herdsman took the pipe to the house of the murdered girl.
The mother, the father, and the second sister successively tried
it, and the pipe always sang a like song, Blow, mother, blow,
etc. The father then put the pipe into the eldest sister's hands.
She had hardly touched it, when blood spattered her cheeks, and
the pipe sang:</p>

<p>'Blow on, sister, blow: God shall wreak me now.<br/>
Thou, sister, 't was didst slay me, the younger tried to stay thee,'<br/>
etc.</p>

<p>The murderess was torn by wild horses.</p>

<p>Professor Bugge reports a Norwegian tale, Grundtvig, in, 878,
which resembles the ballad at the beginning. There were in a
family two daughters and a son. One sister was wasteful, the
other saving. The second complained of the first to her parents,
and was killed and buried by the other. Foliage covered the
grave, so that it could not be seen, but on the trees under which
the body lay, there grew " strings." These the brother cut off
and adapted to his fiddle, and when he played, the fiddle said,
My sister is killed. The father, having heard the fiddle's revela
tion, brought his daughter to confess her act.</p>

<p>There is a series of tales which represent a king, or other
personage, as being afflicted with a severe malady, and as
promising that whichever of his children, commonly three sons,
should bring him something necessary for his cure or comfort
should be his heir: (1) 'La Flor del Lilil&aacute;,' Fernan
Caballero, Lagrimas, cap. 4; (2) 'La ca&ntilde;a del riu de
arenas,' Mil&aacute;, Observaciones sobre la poesia popular, p.
178, No 3; (3) 'Es kommt doch einmal an den Tag,' M&uuml;llenhof,
Sagen, u.s.w., p. 495, No 49; (4) 'Vom singenden Dudelsack,'
Gonzenbach, Sicilianische Marchen, I, 329, No 51. Or the
inheritance is promised to whichever of the children finds
something lost, or rich and rare, a griffin's feather, a golden
branch, a flower: (5) 'Die Greifenfeder,' Schneller, M&auml;rchen
und Sagen aus Walschtirol, p. 143, No 51; (6) 'La Flauuto,'
Blad&eacute;, Contes et proverbes populaires recueillis en
Armagnac, p. 3, No 1; (7) Wackernagel, in Haupt's Zeitschrift,

M&auml;rchen u. Sagen, p. 193, No 71, = Sutermeister,
Kinder-u.-Hausm&auml;rchen aus der Schweiz, p. 119, No 39. Or a
king promises his daughter to the man who shall capture a
dangerous wild beast, and the exploit is undertaken by three
brothers [or two]: (8) 'Der singende Knochen,' Grimms, K. u. H.
m&auml;rchen, I, 149, No 28 (1857); (9) 'Die drei Br&uuml;der,'
Curtze, Volks&uuml;berlieferungen aus dem Furstenthum Waldeck, p. 53,
No 11; (10) 'Der Rohrstengel,' Haltrich, Deutsche
Volksm&auml;rchen aus dem Sachsenlande, u.s.w., p. 225, No 42.
With these we may group, though divergent in some respects, (11)
'Der goldene Apfel,' Toeppen, Aberglauben aus Masuren, p.
139.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d010_017','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In all these tales the youngest child is successful,
and is killed, out of envy, by the eldest or by the two elder.
[There are only two children in (6), (7), (8); in (4) the second
is innocent, as in the Polish tale.] Reeds grow over the spot
where the body is buried (1), (2), (10), (11), or an
<a name="Page_I_126"/>
elder bush
(3), out of which a herdsman makes a pipe or flute; or a white
bone is found by a herdsman, and he makes a pipe or horn of it
(5-9); or a bag-pipe is made of the bones and skin of the
murdered youth (4). The instrument, whenever it is played,
attests the murder.</p>

<p>Among the tales of the South African Bechuana, there is one of
a younger brother, who has been killed by an older, immediately
appearing as a bird, and announcing what has occurred. The bird
is twice killed, and the last time burnt and its ashes scattered
to the winds, but still reappears, and proclaims that his body
lies by a spring in the desert. Grimms, K. u. H. m. Ill, 361.
Liebrecht has noted that the fundamental idea is found in a
Chinese drama, ' The Talking Dish,' said to be based on a popular
tale. An innkeeper and his wife kill one of their guests for his
money, and burn the body. The innkeeper collects the ashes and
pounds the bones, and makes a sort of mortar and a dish. This
dish speaks very distinctly, and denounces the murderers. Journal
Asiatique, 1851, 4th Series, vol. 18, p. 523.</p>
