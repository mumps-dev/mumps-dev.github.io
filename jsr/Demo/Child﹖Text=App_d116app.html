<h3>Adam Bell, Clim of the Clough and William of Cloudesly</h3>

<h3>Appendix</h3>

<h3>The Second Part of Adam Bell</h3>

<p>August 16, 1586, there was entered to Edward White, in the
Stationers' Registers, 'A ballad of William Clowdisley neuer
printed before:' Arber, II, 455. This was in all probability the
present piece, afterwards printed with 'Adam Bell' as a Second
Part. The Second Part of Adam Bell was entered to John Wright,
September 24, 1608: Arber, III, 390. The ballad is a pure
manufacture, with no root in tradition, and it is an absurd
extravaganza besides. The copy in the Percy Folio, here collated
with the earliest preserved printed copy, has often the better
readings, but may have been corrected, a has such monstrosities
as y-then, y-so.</p>
