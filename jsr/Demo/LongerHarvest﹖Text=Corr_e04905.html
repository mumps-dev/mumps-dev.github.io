<h3>49. The Twa Brothers</h3>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>P. 435, V, 217. Communicated by Mr. J.K. Hudson of Manchester.
Sung after a St. George play regularly acted on All Souls' Day at
a village a few miles from Chester, and written down for Mr.
Hudson by one of the performers, a lad of sixteen. The play was
introduced by a song called Souling (similar to a Stephening, see
I, 234), and followed by two songs, of which this is the last,
the whole dramatic company singing.</p>

<p>P. 436 a, 3d paragraph. It ought to have been remarked that it
was a William Somerville that killed John. The names being the
same as in the ballad, "unusually gratuitous" is not
warranted.</p>

<p>438. <b>A</b> was derived by Sharpe from Elizabeth Kerry. The
original copy was not all written at one time, but may have been
written by one person. The first and the last stanza, and some
corrections, are in the same hand as a letter which accompanied
the ballad. The paper has a watermark of 1817. A few trifling
differences in the Manuscript may be noted:</p>

of Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe. This fragment has some
resemblances to <b>F</b>. "Copied 1823" is endorsed on the sheet

out.</p>
