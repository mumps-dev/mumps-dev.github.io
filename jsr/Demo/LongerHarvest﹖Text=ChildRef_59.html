<p>This ballad, one of the most important of all that the Percy
manuscript has saved from oblivion, was first given to the world
in the Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, II, 48, ed. 1765, II,
49, ed. 1767, with conjectural emendations by the editor, and the
insertion of some stanzas to complete the story. A second
version, very much humbled in diction, and otherwise corrupted,
but of indubitable antiquity, as Scott remarks, was published in
the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border in 1803, as communicated by
Mr. Williamson Burnet, of Monboddo, from the recitation of an old
woman. The story which this version relates was then, we are
informed, universally current in the Mearns, and was supposed to
be authenticated by the sword of the hero, preserved nearly down
to that time by his reputed descendants.</p>

<p>Tales of the same general description &mdash; of a noble lady
accused to her husband of infidelity, believed by him to be
guilty, and in process of time demonstrated to have been
faultless, to his entire conviction &mdash; are, as might be
expected, extremely often to be met with in ballad, romance,
chronicle, or saga; nor is the number small of those which have
the special traits that the accusation is made by a trusted
officer of the husband, who has attempted to seduce the lady, and
has failed, and that the wife is cleared by a judgment of God.
Our ballad belongs with a very distinct Scandinavian variety of
these last, but has adopted one characteristic trait fr0111
auother source.</p>

<p>The English version, as written down about the middle of the
seventeenth century, narrates that Sir Aldingar, steward of King
Henry, repulsed by the queen whom he has sought to make his
paramour, cannot rest till he has revenge. He takes a lazar that
happens to come to the king's gates, and lays him in the queen's
bed, promising that in two hours the blind and lame shall be
whole and sound; he then goes to fetch the king. The king,
convinced by his eyes, says he will hang the lazar and burn his
wife, and immediately proceeds to tell the queen his discovery.
The queen sees the hand of Aldingar in this, and also the meaning
of a dream she has had: 'how a vulture, or griffin, had carried
her crown away, and would have taken her to his nest<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> had it
not been for a merlin, a little hawk, that came flying from the
east and struck the big bird down. She claims the right to
maintain her innocence by battle, and the king gives her forty
days to provide herself with a champion, which failing she shall
be burnt. No man in all the south country will undertake her
cause, but a messenger who rides into the east meets what seems
to be a child, who interrogates him, and, getting a slow answer,
bids the queen by him to remember her dream and be of good cheer,
for when bale is highest boot shall be nighest. The days of grace
being out, and no champion found, the queen is put into a tun to
burn, and looks only for death. At this moment a child is seen
riding from the east, who, when he comes to the fire, orders the
brands to be withdrawn and Aldingar to be produced. Aldingar, a
very large man, would not have minded fifty such. The child
claims the first stroke, and if Aldingar can give a second he
need not spare him. Aldingar's legs are cut off at the knee with
this stroke. Aldingar asks for a priest to shrive him, confesses
everything, and begs the queen's forgiveness. The child enjoins
King Harry to take back his wife and love her, for she is true as
stone; the lazar under the gallows becomes a sound man at the same
instant, and is made steward in Aldingar's place.</p>

<p>The Scottish ballad repeats the main part of this story,
dropping all that is miraculous save the simple judgment of God.
Rodingham, who represents Aldingar, does not cajole the leper
with the promise of being restored to health, but intoxicates him
with sweet liquors, and lays him asleep in the queen's bed. The
king wishes to believe the queen guiltless, and proposes that she
shall find a champion. The champion is an ordinary knight; the
leper is neither better nor worse for the part he is made to
play; and the knight is rewarded with a gift of lands. That the
Scottish ballad is the original of the English is a singularly
unhappy idea of Sir Walter Scott's, and it is hard to conceive
what suggested such a notion, unless it were the allegation that
the sword with which Sir Hugh defended the queen's honor was
until a late day producible by his posterity, whereas no one
pretends to have the other. But Sir Walter could not seriously
have credited this tradition, for he himself observes that there
is no instance in history in which the honor of a queen of
Scotland was committed to the chance of a duel.</p>

<p>Cousin to the English ballad is the Scandinavian 'Ravengaard
og Memering,' Grundtvig, No 13, I, 177-213, 426 f, II, 640-45,
III, 779-82, IV, 722-31. There are eleven versions in all,
besides a <b>Norwegian</b> copy, extant at the end of the last
century, of which now only the story is at our command. Eight of
the eleven texts are Danish, <b>A</b>-<b>C</b>,
<b>G</b>-<b>L</b>. <b>A</b> is from a manuscript of the middle of
the sixteenth century, and so a hundred years older than 'Sir
Aldingar.' The other Danish copies are from recent
tradition,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and so are F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>. An
Icelandic version, <b>F</b>, is from a seventeenth-centnry
manuscript.</p>

<p>The old Danish ballad affords the following story. Gunild
[Gunder] lives at Spire, and many nobles from all quarters of the
compass sue for her hand, which Henry, Duke of Brunswick and
Schleswig, obtains. Henry, going to the wars, commits to
Ravengaard the protection of his land, and especially of his
wife. But no sooner is the duke fairly away than Ravengaard goes
to "the queen," and demands of her the sword Adelring, which she
has in keeping. This being refused, Ravengaard threatens that he
will tell false tales of her, but the lady is not intimidated.
The duke comes home, and asks Ravengaard how things are. The
country remains as it was, but Gunild has been acting ill. The
duke will not believe anything wrong of Gunild; but Ravengaard
affirms that he has seen the archbishop with her with his own
eyes. Henry, after repeating this charge to Gunild, beats her
severely, and nobody dares come to the rescue, or to speak for
her, save two ladies of the court, who maintain that Ravengaard
has lied. Then let her find a man who will fight with him, says
the duke. Bare-headed and bare-foot Gunild goes to the hall where
the knights are drinking. They all rise; but when she asks, Is
there anybody here who will fight for a woman? there is no
response except from Memering. He had served her father fifteen
years; never had he seen her so wretched, bare-shouldered,
bare-foot. Ravengaard had had more of her father's bounty than
anybody, and he has been the first to betray her. Memering had
always been last when gifts were giving; but he will go into the
lists for her if he can have the sword Adelring, and this Gunild
promises him. A ring is marked on the ground for the fight.
Ravengaard requires Memering to swear that he knows not of the
sword Adelring. Memering (who has thrust the blade into the
earth) swears that he does not know of more than the hilt being
above ground, and exacts in turn that Ravengaard shall swear that
he has no knowledge of the sword Sudevind [Saadering], to which
Ravengaard makes oath without qualification. With the first blow
Ravengaard cuts Memering's sword in two. This shows, says the
duke, what deeds you have been doing. Memering strikes, and cuts
Ravengaard's sword in two. Ravengaard asks his adversary to wait
a moment till he can tie his shoe, stoops, and picks up the sword
Sudevind; for which perjury, says Memering, thy foul soul is
lost. Ravengaard now cuts a second sword of Memering's in two.
Memering asks for time to tie his shoe, stoops down, and produces
the sword Adelring; for which perjury, says Ravengaard, thy foul
soul is lost. But Memering had been careful to swear with
circumstance: he had sworn that he knew of nothing but the hilt
being above ground. With one stroke he cuts Sudevind in two, and
with a second Ravengaard's neck. And now Gunild may say to the
duke, You see Ravengaard lied. Henry begs forgiveness. Memering,
who has a broken head and leg, demands nothing more than bread
the rest of his days, but Gunild says she will herself be his
leech, and he shall have both bread to eat and scarlet to
wear.</p>

<p>The trick of reserving a peculiarly formidable sword is a
commonplace in northern sagas,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and we are not obliged to
suppose that it belonged to the ballad from the beginning. No
trace of it is found in the other Scandinavian versions.</p>

<p>The Danish versions from recent oral tradition, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>G</b>-<b>L</b>, relate that Henry, going off on an
expedition, commits Gunild to the care of Ravnlil, who forthwith
demands that she shall do his will, otherwise he will tell a
great lie about her. She trusts in the triumph of honesty, and
defies him. Henry comes back, and inquires of Ravnlil about his
wife, and Ravnlil tells his great lie: Gunild spares neither monk
nor priest; he has seen the archbishop with her, <b>C</b>. Henry
seizes Gunild by the hair, throws her to the ground and beats
her; thus shall she be served till she find a kemp that will
fight for her. Gunild goes to the kemp-house, and asks if there
is any man that will fight for a woman. None who will fight for a
whore, <b>H</b>, <b>K</b>. Memering jumps over the table,
<b>B</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, and offers to be her champion. At
the first shock in the lists Memering's horse is brought to his
knees; in the second encounter Memering takes off Ravnlil's head.
Henry offers tons of gold to redeem Gunild. Shame befall him that
sells her, says Memering, and rides off with Gunild, leaving
Henry wringing his hands.</p>

<p><b>K</b>, like <b>A</b>, represents that Gunild was wooed from
all quarters before she was won by Henry. Memering, who sits
lowest at the board, says to Gunild, as in <b>A</b> 20-23, that
he had served her father eleven years, and never seen her with
bare feet. In <b>C</b> Memering finds Gunild weeping, and,
learning the reason, asks the loan of her father's horse,
receives horse and armor of proof, goes where the kemps are
drinking, and challenges the slanderer. The burly villain says he
will take him in his left hand and chuck him out of the country,
crush all his limbs with his little finger. After the fight,
Memering presents Gunild with "the head that has belied her," and
she carries it to Henry, who asks in wonder, Who in all my land
has hewn down a man so big? Memering, the least of men, she says.
Henry offers him his Sudselille, his Strudselille, his Spire, but
will have Gunild for his own. Memering bids him keep his gifts;
he will not resign Gunild, whom he has won. The diminutive size of
Memering is noted also in <b>B</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>,
and the hugeness of Ravnlil in <b>B</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>. In
<b>H</b> Memering knocks off his opponent's hat in the first
bout, and the head follows in the second. Now we will ride off,
says Memering to Gunild; but Gunild will not budge till she has
had vengeance on Henry.</p>

<p>The Norwegian story has lost the beginning, but agrees well
with the Danish so far as it goes. Gunild goes into the kemps'
hall, and asks if any man dare fight for a woman against huge
Ronnegaar. All are silent but Mimmer, smallest of Christian men,
who offers himself. Gunild holds him cheap for his low stature,
and says he had better stay at home and keep his sheep; but he,
not rebuffed, mounts his horse, seeks out Ronnegaar, and, after a
three days' fight, vanquishes him and cuts off his head, which he
ties to his saddle-bow and brings back in triumph.</p>

<p>The Icelandic ballad is in accord with the Danish until we
come to the judicium dei, and then an ordeal by hot iron takes
the place of the combat. So with the two F&auml;r&ouml;e copies,
which, however, mix both forms, and inconsistently bring in
Memering, with nothing for him to do. King Diderik replaces Henry
in all three, but Spire remains the place of the action. When the
returning king asks after Gunild, he is told that the archbishop
has been seen lying with her, or the bishop's brother, and others
besides. He seizes her by the hair and drags her from her bed,
<b>F</b>, beats her for two days, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, and a
third, and no one dares interfere. At last two of his children
beg him to stop, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>; ask what their mother has
done, <b>F</b>. She has been untrue. Then let her carry iron and
walk on steel. Nine times she carries iron and ten times she
walks on steel, <b>F</b>. The conclusion is very much injured in
all these copies. In the Icelandic, <b>F</b>, "all her iron bands
fall off;" her accuser goes to infernal punishment, and she to
heaven. In <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, after the children have asked for
the ordeal by fire, Gunild goes to the strand, or along the
street, and meets Mimmering, smallest of Christian men, <b>E</b>,
who says he has served her father eight years, and never saw her
in such wretched plight. She then goes to another land, <b>D</b>;
Mimmering takes her from heathen land (which at least makes him
of some use), <b>E</b>; when she enters a church her iron bands
burst. She is making gifts of a Yule day, aud gives her traducer
a red ring, meaning a rope round his neck.</p>

<p>The names of the four actors in the Scandinavian versions are:
Henry, as in English, in all the Danish copies,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> replaced by
King Diderik in F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, Icelandic
<b>F</b>; Gunild, or Gunder, Gunni, Gunde, in all copies,
including the Norwegian; Memering, Mimmering, in all but the
Norwegian and Danish <b>H</b>, which have the slight
modifications Mimmer, Nimmering, these last, as also
F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, adding the suffix Tand. There
is considerable variety, always with some likeness, in the fourth
name: Raffuengaard, Danish <b>A</b>; R&ouml;ng&aring;rd,
<b>H</b>; Ronnegaar, the Norwegian; Ravnlil, <b>B</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, Ravnhild, <b>I</b>; Rundkrud Hagensgaard,
<b>C</b>; Roysningur. F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>;
R&ouml;gnvaldr, Icelandic <b>F</b>. Ravengaard,
R&ouml;ng&aring;rd, Ronnegaar, with the Anglo-Latin Rodingar,
presently to be mentioned, are evidently the forerunners of the
English Aldingar (Sir Raldingar) and Rodingham.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The English
Eleanor is probably a later substitution for Gunild, become
unfamiliar. Eleanor may have been meant or understood for Henry
Second's queen (less likely for Henry Third's, though she went
into a monastery), but considering how freely the name is dealt
with in English ballads, the question is hardly worth raising,
and assuredly it never was raised except by editors.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Memering is of diminutive size in <b>B</b>-<b>E</b>,
<b>H</b>-<b>K</b>, the smallest of Christian men in <b>E</b>, and
also in the Norwegian copy.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The large size of his antagonist
is noted in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, and the
Norwegian copy. His representative in English <b>A</b> seems no
more in a man's likeness than a child of four years old. Aldingar
would not have recked had there been half a hundred such; and
Aldingar is as big as a fooder, "a tun of man," like Falstaff,
though not so unwieldy.</p>

<p>Gunhild, daughter of Cnut the Great and Emma, was married in
1036 to King Henry, afterwards the Emperor Henry III, and died of
the plague at Ravenna two years later, never having had any
trouble with her husband. William of Malmesbury, who died only a
little more than a hundred years after Gunhild, 1142 or 1143,
writes of her as follows: She was a girl of extraordinary beauty,
and had been sighed for in vain by many suitors before her hand
was bestowed upon Henry. She was attended to the ship which was
to take her to her husband by a procession so splendid that it
was still in William's day the theme of popular song. After many
years of married life she was denounced for adultery, and offered
as her champion against her accuser (who was a man of gigantic
bulk), others refusing, a mere boy that she had brought with her
from England, who by miracle hamstrung her defamer. Gunhild then
could not be induced by threats or blandishments to live longer
with her husband, but took the veil, and passed the remainder of
a long life in the service of God.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>It will be recognized that we have in this narrative many
points of the English and Danish ballad: the beauty of the queen,
English <b>A</b> 2; her numerous suitors, Danish <b>A</b>,
<b>K</b>; the youth or under size of the queen's champion, who
had previously been in the service of her family, and the huge
dimensions of the other party; the triumph of weakness and
innocence, and Gunhild's separating herself from Henry, Danish
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>-<b>L</b>. Nor can we well doubt that
William of Malmesbury was citing a ballad, for the queen's
wonderful deliverance in so desperate an extremity would be even
more likely to be celebrated in popular song than her magnificent
wedding, and a ballad is known to have been made upon a similar
and equally fabulous adventure which is alleged in chronicle to
have occurred to Gunhild's mother.</p>

<p>Malmesbury does not mention the names of the combatants,
though he may very well have known them. These names are supplied
by a French metrical life of Edward the Confessor,
"translat&eacute;e du Latin," of which the manuscript must have
been written before 1272, and may, perhaps, be dated as early as
1245. In this poem we are told that Gunhild, having been
calumniated to her husband, the Emperor Henry, was obliged by the
custom of the empire to purge herself by battle, and with
difficulty could find a champion, because her accuser was of
gigantic size. But a dwarf, whom she had brought up, by name
Mimecan,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> undertook to fight for her, hamstrung the giant at
the first blow, and at the second cut off his feet, "as the
history says." The lady, thus acquitted, declined to have the
emperor for her lord. The other name is given in verses
describing a picture of the combat, one of many illustrations
which adorn the manuscript: How the dwarf Mimecan, to redeem the
honor of his mistress, fights with the huge old Rodegan, and cuts
off his feet; where Rodegan is, perhaps, an adaptation of
Rodingar, for rhyme's sake;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> but we have Rodyngham in
English <b>B</b>.</p>

<p>In The Chronica Majora of Matthew Paris, I, 515, ed. Luard,
manuscript of the beginning of the fourteenth century, the
passage in Malmesbury is repeated, with additions from other
sources. The name of Gunhild's champion is given as Mimecan, and
the dwarf is further said to have cut off the giant's head, as in
the Norwegian version of the ballad and Danish <b>C</b>, and to
have presented it to his mistress, as in Danish <b>C</b>.
Brompton's Chronide, of the second half of the fourteenth
century, reiterates the story of the duel, giving the names of
both combatants, Mimecan (misprinted or misread Municon) and
Roddyngar.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>It is highly probable that this story became connected with
Gunhild, wife of Henry III, in consequence of her bearing the
name Cunigund after her marriage, owing to which circumstance she
might become confused with the consort of the Emperor St. Henry
II, St. Cunigund, in whose legendary history there is a passage
essentially similar. St. Cunigund's married life extended from
1002 to 1024. After Henry's death she retired to a nunnery, and
she died "in the service of God," 1033, which corresponds with
what Malmesbury says of Gunhild. Notwithstanding the mutual
asceticism of the imperial pair, reports obtained, instigated by
the devil, that Cunigund had doubly broken her vows, nor did
these fail to make an impression on her husband's mind. To
justify herself, Cunigund offered to walk barefoot over red-hot
ploughshares, or, according to another account, to carry red-hot
iron in her hands, and she went through the test without
injury.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This form of ordeal is of the nature of what is
suggested in the F&auml;r&ouml;e and the Icelandic ballad, and
executed in the latter, where Gunild both walks over hot steel
and carries hot iron in her hands.</p>

<p>Emma, Gunhild's mother, had the misfortune to be subjected to
the same aspersions as her daughter and the Empress Cunigund, and
was favored with the like glorious vindication. Accused of having
a bishop for her lover, she asked to be submitted to the ordeal
of hot iron, and walked over nine glowing ploughshares, in the
church of St. Swithin, Winchester, not only without injury, but
even without the consciousness of what she had done.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> We are
expressly informed tbat a ballad on the subject was sung by a
minstrel in the hall of the prior of St. Swithin on the occasion
of a visit of the Bishop of Winchester in 1338, in conjunction

<p>Earlier instances of a miraculous exoneration, under similar
circumstances, are those of Richarda, or Richardis, wife of the
Emperor Charles III, 887, and of Gundeberg, wife of the Lombard
king Arioald, c. 630.</p>

<p>Richarda, accused of adultery with a bishop, protests, like
Cunigund, not only her innocence of crime, but her intact
virginity after a marriage of ten or twelve years, and offers
herself to the judgment of God, either by duel or hot
ploughshares; or actually proves her integrity by some form of
ordeal, divino [aquino] judicio, or by passing through fire in a
waxed shift, or donning a wax shift, which is set on fire at her
hands and feet. Disculpated thus, she goes, like Cunigund, into a
monastery for the rest of her days.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Gundeberg happening to praise a certain nobleman's figure, he
solicited her in shameless style, and was most contemptuously
rejected. Upon this he tells the king that Gundeberg means to
poison her busband and take another man, and the queen is put
under confinement. Remonstrance is made by the king of the
Franks, to which race Gundberg belongs, and Arioald consents to
allow her to clear herself by a champion. One Pitto (otherwise
Carellus) fights with the accuser and kills him.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_016','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> If Pitto,
as Bugge has suggested, and as seems more than plausible, be
Little (old Italian pitetto, etc.), then the root of the
Scandinavian-English story is found in the early part of the
seventh century. The name Carellus may also be a significant
diminutive.</p>

<p>Henry, in the Scandinavian ballad, accepts the testimony of
the man in whose charge he had left Gunild, without asking for
proof. Circumstantial evidence is offered in the English ballad;
the false steward shows the king a leper lying in the queen's
bed. Aldingar induces the leper to conform to his orders by
promising that he shall be a sound man in two hours. Rodyngham
gives the leper a drink, and lays him in the bed asleep. The
queen, to the advantage of good taste, but to the detriment of
the proof, is not there in either case.</p>

<p>We have here a link with the story of Oliva, or Sibilla, in
the Charlemagne cycle of fictions. We may begin with the second
section of the Karlamagnus saga, because we know that it was
translated from an English copy brought home by a Norseman
resident in Scotland in 1287.</p>

<p>Olif is here sister to Charles, and married to King Hugo.
Going to the chase, Hugo leaves his wife in the care of his
steward, Milon, who bad long had a passion for her, and takes
advantage of this occasion to declare it. The queen threatens to
have him hanged. Milon goes home, puts a potion in a mazer,
returns to the queen, and, pretending that what he had said was
only a jest and meant to try her virtue, asks her, in token of
reconciliation, to drink the cup with him. He feigns to begin; the
queen follows in earnest, and falls into a dead sleep. He lays
her in her bed, administers the same drink to a black beggar,
and, when it has had its effect, lays him by the queen, putting
the arms of each about the other's neck. When the king comes back
he wonders that his wife does not come to meet him, and asks
where she is. The steward answers, as in <b>A</b> 8, that the
queen has taken a new love, and conducts the king to his chamber.
Hugo cuts off the black man's head. Every drop of his blood turns
to a burning candle, which makes the king think that he has
killed a holy man. But the steward says, Not so; rather she is a
witch, that can make stones float and feathers sink, and urges
the king, now that his sword is out, to take off the queen's head,
too. The king refuses. Olif wakes, and is astounded at what her
eyes behold. What means this black man in her bed! God wot, says
Milon, he has long been your leman. The queen demands an ordeal,
according to the law of the land; and successively proposes that
she shall be put naked into a copper over a hot fire, or be
thrown from a high tower on sword and spear points, or be taken in
a boat out of sight of land and thrown into the water. The king
is each time disposed to let her have her way, but is always
dissuaded by Milon, who tells him that no such trial would
signify anything with a witch of her powers. Hereupon a knight
leaps up and knocks Milon down for a liar, and offers to fight
him on these terms: Milon to be fully armed and on his best horse,
and the challenger to have no armor, a mule for a steed, and a
wooden wand for a weapon. Milon is immediately thrown, but the
king is still induced to think this to be more of his wife's
magic, calls his best men to council, and bids them determine
what death she shall die. There is no further resemblance to our
ballad. Karlamagnus Saga, Af Frn Olif ok Landres, Unger, p.
51.</p>

<p>A F&auml;r&ouml;e ballad, '&Oacute;luvu kv&aelig;&eth;i,'
Hammershaimb, in Antiquarisk Tidsskrift, 1846-48, p. 281, repeats
this story with variations, and as we are informed by Grundtvig,
I, 201, so do Icelandic rimes, 'Landres r&iacute;mur,' as yet
unprinted. In the F&auml;r&ouml;e ballad, after &Oacute;luva's
champion (who had come with her from home, like Memering) has
unhorsed her accuser, she passes the ordeal of water and fire
triumphantly, and still another.</p>

<p>In the Spanish prose romance of Oliva (printed in 1498) and
the French chanson de geste of Doon l'Alemanz (fifteenth-century
manuscript), the heroine, who is now Pepin's sister, becomes the
victim of slander, not in consequence of her having rebuffed an
overweening lover, but because the father or uncle of the
arch-traitor Ganelon had been thwarted in his plan to match his
daughter or sister with the nobleman upon whom Pepin has bestowed
Oliva. It is an ordinary young lad who is put into the lady's
bed, and no loathsome leper or beggar. The injured woman asks for
the ordeal of fire or of water, and, in the Spanish romance, when
these are refused her, to be thrown from a tower. After much
difficulty this right is conceded in the latter, and, like
Richardis,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_017','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> she walks through a blazing fire, in simple

not. F. Wolf, Ueber die neuesten Leistungen der Franzosen,

<p>According to other forms of the same story, it is Sibilla,
wife of Charles the Great, that is temporarily repudiated by her
husband, owing to a false suspicion of unfaithfulness, seemingly
justified by an ugly dwarf being found in bed with her. A French
romance, which narrated this story, is described in the Chronicle
of Alberich, a monk of the cloister of Trois Fontaines, in the
diocese of Li&egrave;ge, writing in the first half of the
thirteenth century.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_018','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A fragment of the latter half of such a

and queen are nameless in the last two, and the queen bears the
name of Blan&ccedil;iflor in 'Macaire.' In the two German
versions the false marshal repeats the part of the false steward
in the English and Norse story; having failed with the queen, he
lays a sleeping dwarf in her bed. The dwarf is principal in the
Spanish and Dutch story, and after a discomfiture in which he
loses some of his teeth at the vigorous hand of the queen, creeps
into her bed while she is asleep. He does the same in the
Venetian-French romance, thinking to get vengeance for rough
handling from his mistress when acting as Pandarus for Macaire,
of whose spite against the queen for, rebuking his inordinate
passion he is all the while the tool.</p>

<p>Sibilla appears again as Sisibe, daughter of a Spanish king,
married to Sigmundr, father of Sigur&eth;r F&aacute;fnisbani. The
king, summoned to arms, entrusts her to two of his nobles, one of
whom, Hartvin, proposes that she shall accept him as a husband,
and is threatened with the gallows. The two represent to the
king, on his return, that the queen has had a handsome thrall for
her partner during his absence. Hartvin advises that she be
relegated to a desolate forest and have her tongue cut out, to
which Sigmundr assents. &THORN;i&eth;riks Saga, Unger, p. 159 ff,

<p>The first part of the English romance of Sir Triamour, or a
little more than 600 verses, is derived from some French form of
Sibilla. A king going on a crusade to the holy land commits his
queen to the care of his steward; the steward sues the queen to
accept him as a paramour, and is threatened with hanging; the
steward pretends that he has only been proving her, but when the
king comes home tells him that he has seen a man lying with the
queen, and has slain the traitor; the king is minded to burn his
wife, but is advised by the steward rather to banish her; three
days are allowed the queen to quit the country, and if found
after that she is to die in the fire. Percy Society, vol. XVI,

<p>In like manner, Genoveva's husband is persuaded by the false
Golo, who has been charged with the care of her and has abused
his trust, that his wife has admitted a cook to her favor; and
Octavian's mother, in the English romance, excites her son's
resentment against his innocent queen by inducing a scullion,
"lothly of face," to get into the empress's bed: Weber, III 163.

<p>Another series of tales, that has likeness in parts with the
story of Gunhild and of Sibilla, is represented in English by the
pleasing romance of The Ed of Tolous,{22} dating from about
1400.</p>

<p>We read in this lay of Britain, as it is called in the last
stanza, that Barnard, Earl of Toulouse, has become enamored of
the Empress of Germany, with whose lord he is at strife, and has
excited a certain interest in the mind of the lady. Tbe emperor
selects two knights to guard his wife; these conceive a violent
passion for her, and declare it, one after the other, after
having obtained from her a promise of secrecy. She tells the
first that he is a traitor and deserves to be hanged, and the
second that he should be hanged had she not hight to hold
counsel. These knights, who have been in collusion from the
first, think themselves unsafe, notwithstanding the empress's
promise, and conspire to be her ruin. They induce a young
gentleman, for a jest, to strip himself all but bare, and hide
behind a curtain in her chamber while she is sleeping; then
summon "lords of bed" to help take a traitor who is with their
lady in her bower, find the young man where they had put him, and
bear him through the body. The lady is cast into prison. Her
husband, who is far off, has a dream of two wild bears tearing
his wife to pieces, and returns home with all haste. The knights
tell their story. A council is called the next day, and it is
decided that the empress must die (be burned). An old knight
calls attention to the circumstance that the young man's tongue is
stopped, and that none ever found a fault in the lady before; he
advises that proclamation be made for a champion, to which the
king, who loves his wife tenderly, gladly assents. The Earl of
Toulouse hears of the lady's peril, and resolves to go to Germany
and fight for her. This, as being on hostile terms with the
emperor, he must do in disguise. By the help of an abbot, who is
the empress's uncle, he obtains admission to the lady in a monk's
dress, hears her shrift, and assures himself of her innocence;
and then, monk as he seems, offers to do battle with the
accusers. One is run through, the other yields as recreant and
confesses the plot, and both are burned. The monk is revealed by
the abbot, under a pledge that he shall receive no injury, to be
Sir Barnard of Toulouse. The emperor treats his late foe
graciously, and rewards him, even to the extent of dying in three
years, when the earl is chosen his successor and weds the
empress.</p>

<p>Of this story the following are repetitions, with variations:

Paris et Robert, Miracles de Notre Dame, II, 121 ff; (2) the
German Volksbuch, Eine sch&ouml;ne und liebliche History vom

which Hans Sachs founded his play Der Ritter Galmi mit der

Den kydske Dronning, by Jeppe Jensen, 1483, Brandt, Romantisk
Digtning, II, 89 ff; (4) a tale of Bandello, Second Part, No 44,
Amore di Don Giovanni di Mendozza e della Duchessa di Savoia,
printed 1554; (5) the French proseromance L'Histoire de Palanus,
Comte de Lyon, ed. A. de Terrebasse, 1833, put before 1539. In
(1) a dwarf is made to conceal himself in the lady's chamber; in
(2) a scullion to boast that he is the object of her passion; in
(3) a servitor is the instrument of treachery; in (4) a young
gentleman; in (5) this machinery is dropped, and a slanderous
letter does the mischief. In none of these is the lady a German
empress; in (5) she is an English queen; in (2) of British birth.
In all there is a reciprocal predilection on the part of the lady
and her champion.</p>

<p>Spanish and Proven&ccedil;al chroniclers and a Spanish ballad
relate a story substantially according with what we find in The
Earl of Toulouse, the injured heroine being an empress of
Germany, and her champion a count, in all cases but one Count
Ramon of Barcelona.</p>

<p>In the Spanish ballad 'Romance de c&oacute;mo el conde don
Ramon de Barcelona libr&oacute; &aacute; la emperatriz de
Alema&ntilde;a que la tenian para quemar,' Duran, Romancero, II,
210, No 1228, Wolf y Hofmann, Primavera, II, 102, from the Silva
de Romances of 1550, two knights, with no motive given but their
own wickedness, tell the emperor that they have seen the empress
toying with her chamberlain. The empress is imprisoned, and casts
about for two knights to defend her life against the accusers. In
all the chivalry of the court there is none that will venture
against appellants so redoubtable, and she is to be burned in
three days. The Count of Barcelona hears the distressing
intelligence, and sets out to the rescue. No one being admitted
to the lady except her confessor, the count makes known to the
holy father that he has come for the defence, and begs, if
possible, that he may first have a word with her majesty. He has
an interview, in the guise of a monk, and is properly welcomed by
the empress, who expresses her confidence that he will succeed in
establishing her innocence, but will not permit him even to kiss
hands. Asking only to take his adversaries one at a time, the
count speedily disposes of the first, when the other surrenders.
The emperor, delighted with the result, wishes to show due honor
to the champion, who, however, is not to be found, having
returned to his estates immediately after the fight; nor is the
empress at liberty to tell who he is until the third day, He is
then revealed to be the flower of chivalry, the lord of
Catalonia. The empress, with the approval of her husband, goes to
Barcelona, attended by a magnificent train and under conduct of
two cardinals, to express her gratitude in person, and is very
splendidly received and entertained.</p>

<p>The oldest of the chroniclers, the Catalan Bernart Desclot,
writing about 1300, ascribes the misfortune of the empress to a
harmless partiality for a young nobleman, which was
misrepresented to the emperor by two of his councillors, out of
envy and spite.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_023','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The empress is allowed a year and a day to
find a champion, in default of which she is to be burned. None of
the knights to whom she has shown kindness dare offer themselves
in her cause, on account of the high favor in which her accusers,
who engage to make good their charge by battle, stand with their
master. But a minstrel attached to the court takes it in hand to
find her a defender, goes to Barcelona, and so interests the
count in the case that he sets out immediately for Germany.
Carbonell, c. 1500, Beuter, c. 1530, and Pujades, &#8224; 1635,
all of whom rely in part on popular tradition, make the count to
be Ramon Berengar III, and Beuter says that, according to the
Catalans, the empress was Matilda, daughter of Henry I of
England, who was married to the emperor Henry V in 1114.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_024','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Proven&ccedil;al chronicles, C&aelig;sar de Nostradamus's
Histoire et chronique de Provence, 1614, and La Royalle Couronne
des Roys d'Arles, 1641, return to the baffled steward or
ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel and his revenge. The empress is
Matilda in Nostradamus, as in Beuter, and the steward simply
accuses her of adultery, and offers to sustain the charge by
battle. No one dares to defend the lady, because the accuser is
un fort rude et dangereux champion. The steward is hanged after
his defeat. In La Royalle Couronne des Roys d'Arles the emperor
is said to be Henry III and the empress Matilde, fille de Camet,
qui avoit est&eacute; roy de Dannemarc et estoit roy
d'Angleterre. The emperor Henry V was as king of Arles Henry III.
Camet, whether miswritten or not, can mean only Canut, and there
is an obvious confusion between Gunild, daughter of Cnut, wife of
Henry III of Germany, and Matilda, daughter of Henry I of England,
wife of Henry III of Arles and V of Germany.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d059_025','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This may be an
