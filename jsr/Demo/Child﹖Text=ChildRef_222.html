<p>Mrs. Brown was not satisfied with <b>A</b> <b>b</b>, which
Jamieson had taken down from her mouth, and after a short time
she sent him <b>A</b> <b>a</b>. The verbal differences are
considerable. We need not suppose that Mrs. Brown had heard two
"sets" or "ways," of which she blended the readings; the fact
seems to be that, at the time when she recited to Jamieson, she
was not in good condition to remember accurately.</p>

<p><b>A</b> <b>a</b>. Glenlion carries off Barbara Livingston
from Dundee and takes her to the Highlands, She is in a stupor of
grief. Glenlion folds her in his arms, and says that he would
give all his flocks and herds for a kind look. She tells him that
he shall never get look or smile unless he takes her back to
Dundee; and he her that she shall never see Dundee till he has
married her. His brother John tries to dissuade him; he himself
would scorn a hand without a heart; but Glenlion has long loved
her, and is resolved to keep her, nevertheless. Glenlion's three
sisters receive Baby kindly, and the youngest begs her to
disclose the cause of her grief. Baby tells the sympathetic Jean
that she has been stolen from her friends and from her lover, and
obtains not only the means of writing a letter to Johny Hay, the
lover, but a swift-footed boy to carry it to Dundee. Johny Hay,
with a band of armed men, makes all speed to Glenlion's castle.
He calls to Baby to jump, and he will catch her; she, more
prudently, slips down on her sheets; her lover takes her on his
horse and rides away. Glenlion hears the ring of a bridle and
thinks it is the priest come to marry him. His brother corrects
the mistake; there are armed men at the castle-gate, and if turns
out that there are enough of them to deter Glenlion's Highlanders
from an attack. So Johny Hay conveys Baby Livingstone safely back
to Dundee.</p>

<p>The other versions give the story a tragical catastrophe. In
B, Barbara is forced into Glenlion's bed. Afterwards she exclaims
that if she had paper and pen she would write to her lover in
Dundee. No difficulty seems to be made; she writes her letter,
and sends it by the ever-ready boy. Geordie, lying in a window,
sees the boy, asks for news, and is told that his love is stolen
by Glenlion. He orders his horse, in fact three horses, and also
a mourning hat and cloak; but though he tires out all three
horses, his love is dead be fore he reaches Glenlion. This copy
is pieced out with all sorts of commonplaces from other ballads:
see 9 (which is nonsense), 10, 13, 14, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29,
30.</p>

<p><b>C</b> is a briefer, that is, an unfarced, form of <b>B</b>.
Glenlion is corrupted to Linlyon.</p>

<p><b>D</b> has its commonplaces again. For Barbara we have
Annie, and Glendinning for Glenlion, and a brother Jemmy instead
of a lover. In <b>B</b> the ravisher is Lochell.</p>

<p>Dr. Joseph Robertson in his Adversaria, Manuscript, p. 87,
gives these two lines of 'Baby Livingston:'</p>

<p>The kidnapping of women for a compulsory marriage was a
practice which prevailed for hundreds of years, and down to a
late date, and, of course, not only in Great Britain. The
unprotected female, especially if she had any property, must have
been in a state of miserable insecurity, and even a convent was
far from furnishing her an asylum. See for England, in the first
half of the fifteenth century, Beamont's Annals of the Lords of
Warrington, pp. 256-61 and 265 f.; for Scotland, in the same
century and the two following, Sharpe's Ballad Book, p. 99 ff.,
R. Chambers's Domestic Annals of Scotland, 1858, I, 223-5, 415
f.; for Ireland, Fronde, The English in Ireland in the Eighteenth
Century, 1872, I, 417 ff. Other Scottish ballads celebrating
similar abductions are '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_223.html">Eppie Morrie</a>,' '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_224.html">The Lady of Arngosk</a>,'
and
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_225.html">Rob Roy</a>,' which immediately follow.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d222_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
