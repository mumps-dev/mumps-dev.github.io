<h3>96. The Gay Goshawk</h3>


<p>P. 856 a, III, 517 a. Add: (18) 'La Fille dans la Tour,'
Daymard, Vieux Chants p. rec. en Quercy, p. 174; (19) 'La belle
dans la Tour,' Pas de Calais, communicated by M.G. Doncieux to
Revue des Traditions populaires, VI, 603; (20) 'Belle Idoine,'
Questionnaire de Folklore, public par la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; du
Folklore Wallon, p. 79.</p>

<p>M. Doucieux has attempted a reconstruction of the text in
M&eacute;lusine, V, 265 ff. He cites M. Gaston Paris as having
lately pointed out a striking similitude between the first half
of the French popular ballad and that of a little romance of Bele
Ydoine composed in the twelfth century by Audefrois le Bastars
(Bartsch, Altfranz&ouml;sische Romanzen und Pastourellen, p. 59,
No 57). This resemblance has, I suppose, occasioned the title of
'Belle Idoine' to be given editorially to No 20 above, for the
name does not occur in the ballad.</p>

<p>356 b, in, 517 a. Add: 'Au Jardin des Olives,' Guillon, p. 83,
'Dessous le Rosier blanc,' Daymard, p. 171 (Les trois
Capitaines). A girl feigns death to avoid becoming a king's
mistress, 'Hertig Henrik och Konungen,' Lagus, Nyl&auml;ndska
Folkvisor, I, 117, No 37.</p>

<p>363. <b>E</b>. The following is the Manuscript copy, "of some
antiquity," from which <b>E</b> was in part constructed. (Whether
it be the original or a transcript cannot be determined, but Mr.
Macmath informs me that the paper on which it is written "seems
about the oldest sheet in the volume.") The text was freely
handled. 'Lord William' does not occur in it, but the name is
found in another version which follows this.</p>

<p>The Ettrick Shepherd sent Scott the following stanzas to be
inserted in the first edition at places indicated. Most of them
are either absolutely base metal or very much worn by
circulation. The clever contrivance for breathing (found also in
<b>G</b> 39, <b>H</b> 19) and the bribing of the surgeon provoke
scorn and resentment.</p>
