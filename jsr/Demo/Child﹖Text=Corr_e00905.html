<h3>9. The Fair Flower of Northumberland</h3>


<p>P. 116. <b>D</b>. In a copy sent by Motherwell to C.K. Sharpe
with a letter, October 8, 1825, this version is said to have been
obtained from Mrs. Nicol, of Paisley.</p>

<p>117, 493 a.</p>

<h3>G</h3>

<p>'The Heiress of Northumberland,' from C.K. Sharpe's first
collection, p. 7.</p>

<p>Sir W. Scott, commenting on this copy (to which he by mistake
gives the title of The Stirrup of Northumberland), says: "An
edition considerably varied both from Ritson's and the present I
have heard sung by the Miss Tytlers of Woodhouselee. The tune is
a very pretty lilt." Sharpe's Ballad Book, ed. 1880, p. 142.</p>

<p>At the end of the ballad we are told: Tradition's story is
that the hero of this song was one of the Earls of Douglass, who
was taken captive and put in prison by Percy, Earl of
Northumberland.</p>
