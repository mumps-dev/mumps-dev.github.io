<h3>Eppie Morrie</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Eppie Morrie,' Maidment's North Countrie Garland, p. 40, 18. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d22301.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>"This ballad," says Maidment, "is probably much more than a
century old, though the circumstances which have given rise to it
were unfortunately too common to preclude the possibility of its
being of a later date." He does not tell us where the ballad came
from, and no other editor seems to know of it. Two stanzas, 10,
11, occur in a copy of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_225.html">Rob Roy</a>' (No 225, <b>J</b>) which had
once been in Maidment's hands, and perhaps was obtained from the
same region.</p>

<p>Four-and-twenty Highlanders, the leader of whom is one Willie,
come to Strathdon from Carrie (Carvie?) side to steal away Eppie
Morrie, who has refused to marry Willie. They tie her on a horse
and take her to a minister, whom Willie, putting a pistol to his
breast, orders to marry them. The minister will not consent
unless Eppie is willing, and she strenuously refuses; so they
take her to Carrie side and put her to bed. She defends herself
successfully, and in the morning comes in her lover, Belbordlane,
or John Forsyth, well armed, and we presume well supported, who
carries her back to her mother, to be his bride.</p>

<p>Scott, Introduction to Rob Roy, Appendix, No V, cites two
stanzas of a ballad derived from tradition which, if we had the
whole, might possibly turn out to be the same story with
different names.</p>
