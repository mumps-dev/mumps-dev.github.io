<h3>Advertisement to Part I</h3>

<p>Numbers 1-28</p>

<p>It was my wish not to begin to print The English and Scottish
Popular Ballads until this unrestricted title should be justified
by my having at command every valuable copy of every known
ballad. A continuous effort to accomplish this object has been
making for some nine or ten years, and many have joined in it. By
correspondence, and by an extensive diffusion of printed
circulars, I have tried to stimulate collection from tradition in
Scotland, Canada, and the United States, and no becoming means
has been left unemployed to obtain possession of unsunned
treasures locked up in writing. The gathering from tradition has
been, as ought perhaps to have been foreseen at this late day,
meagre, and generally of indifferent quality. Materials in the
hands of former editors have, in some cases, been lost beyond
recovery, and very probably have lighted fires, like that large
cantle of the Percy manuscript, <i>maxime deftendus!</i> Access to
several manuscript collections has not yet been secured. But what
is still lacking is believed to bear no great proportion to what
is in hand, and may soon come in, besides: meanwhile, the
uncertainties of the world forbid a longer delay to publish so
much as has been got together.</p>

<p>Of hitherto unused materials, much the most important is a
large collection of ballads made by Motherwell. For leave to take
a copy of this I am deeply indebted to the present possessor, Mr
Malcolm Colquhoun Thomson, of Glasgow, who even allowed the
manuscript to be sent to London, and to be retained several
months, for my accommodation. Mr. J. Wylie Guild, of Glasgow, also
permitted the use of a note-book of Motherwell's which
supplements the great manuscript, and this my unwearied friend,
Mr. James Barclay Murdoch, to whose solicitation I owe both,
himself transcribed with the most scrupulous accuracy. No other
good office, asked or unasked, has Mr. Murdoch spared.</p>

<p>Next in extent to the Motherwell collections come those of the
late Mr. Kinloch. These he freely placed at my disposal, and Mr.
William Macmath, of Edinburgh, made during Mr. Kinloch's life an
exquisite copy of the larger part of them, enriched with notes
from Mr. Kinloch's papers, and sent it to me across the water.
After Mr. Kinloch's death his collections were acquired by Harvard
College Library, still through the agency of Mr. Macmath, who has
from the beginning rendered a highly valued assistance, not less
by his suggestions and communications than by his zealous
mediation.</p>

<p>No Scottish ballads are superior in kind to those recited in
the last century by Mrs. Brown, of Falkland. Of these there are,
or were, three sets. One formerly owned by Robert Jamieson, the
fullest of the three, was lent me, to keep as long as I required,
by my honored friend the late Mr. David Laing, who also secured
for me copies of several ballads of Mrs. Brown which are found in
an Abbotsford manuscript, and gave me a transcript of the
Glenriddell manuscript. The two others were written down for
William Tytler and Alexander Fraser Tytler respectively, the
former of these consisting of a portion of the Jamieson texts
revised. These having for some time been lost sight of, Miss Mary
Fraser Tytler, with a graciousness which I have reason to believe
hereditary in the name, made search for them, recovered the one
which had been obtained by Lord Woodhouselee, and copied it for
me with her own hand. The same lady furnished me with another
collection which had been made by a member of the family.</p>

<p>For later transcriptions from Scottish tradition I am indebted
to Mr. J.F. Campbell of Islay, whose edition and rendering of the
racy West Highland Tales is marked by the rarest appreciation of
the popular genius; to Mrs. A.F. Murison, formerly of Old Deer,
who undertook a quest for ballads in her native place on my
behalf; to Mr. Alexander Laing, of Newburgh-upon-Tay; to Mr. James
Gibb, of Joppa, who has given me a full score; to Mr. David
Louden, of Morham, Haddington; to the late Dr. John Hill Burton
and Miss Ella Burton; to Dr. Thomas Davidson.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Robert White, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, allowed me
to look through his collections in 1873, and subsequently made me
a copy of such things as I needed, and his ready kindness has
been continued by Mrs. Andrews, his sister, and by Miss Andrews,
his niece, who has taken a great deal of trouble on my
account.</p>

<p>In the south of the mother-island my reliance has, of
necessity, been chiefly upon libraries. The British Museum
possesses, besides early copies of some of the older ballads, the
Percy manuscript, Herd's manuscripts and Buchan's, and the Roxburgh broadsides.
The library of the University of Cambridge affords one or two
things of first-rate importance, and for these I am beholden to
the accomplished librarian, Mr. Henry Bradshaw, and to Professor
Skeat. I have also to thank the Rev. F. Gunton, Dean, and the
other authorities of Magdalene College, Cambridge, for permitting
collations of Pepys ballads, most obligingly made for me by Mr
Arthur S. B. Miller. Many things were required from the Bodleian
library, and these were looked out for me, and scrupulously
copied or collated, by Mr. George Parker.</p>

<p>Texts of traditional ballads have been communicated to me in
America by Mr. W.W. Newell, of New York, who is soon to give us
an interesting collection of Children's Games traditional in
America; by Dr. Huntington, Bishop of Central New York; Mr. G.C.
Mahon, of Ann Arbor, Michigan; Miss Margaret Reburn, of New
Albion, Iowa; Miss Perine, of Baltimore; Mrs. Augustus Lowell, Mrs.
L.F. Wesselhoeft, Mrs. Edward Atkinson, of Boston; Mrs. Gushing,
of Cambridge; Miss Ellen Marston, of New Bedford; Mrs. Moncrieff,
of London, Ontario.</p>

<p>Acknowledgments not well despatched in a phrase are due to
many others who have promoted my objects: to Mr. Furnivall, for
doing for me everything which I could have done for myself had I
lived in England; to that master of old songs and music, Mr.
William Chappell, very specially; to Mr. J. Payne Collier; Mr.
Norval Clyne, of Aberdeen; Mr. Alexander Young, of Glasgow; Mr.
Arthur Laurenson, of Lerwick, Shetland; Mr. J. Burrell Curtis, of
Edinburgh; Dr. Vigfusson, of Oxford; Professor Edward Arber, of
Birmingham; the Rev. J. Percival, Mr. Francis Fry, Mr. J.F.
Nicholls, of Bristol; Professor George Stephens, of Copenhagen;
Mr. R. Bergstr&ouml;m, of the Royal Library, Stockholm; Mr. W.R.S.
Ralston, Mr. William Henry Husk, Miss Lucy Toulmin Smith, Mr. A.F.
Murison, of London; Professor Sophocles; Mr. W.G. Medlicott, of
Longmeadow; to Mr. M. Heilprin, of New York, Mme de Maltchyce, of
Boston, and Rabbi Dr. Cohn, for indispensable translations from
Polish and Hungarian; to Mr. James Russell Lowell, Minister of the
United States at London; to Professor Charles Eliot Norton, for
such " pains and benefits " as I could ask only of a life-long
friend.</p>

<p>In the editing of these ballads I have closely followed the
plan of Grundtvig's Old Popular Ballads of Denmark, a work which
will be prized highest by those who have used it most, and which
leaves nothing to be desired but its completion. The author is as
much at home in English as in Danish tradition, and whenever he
takes up a ballad which is common to both nations nothing remains
to be done but to supply what has come to light since the time of
his writing. But besides the assistance which I have derived from
his book, I have enjoyed the advantage of Professor Grundtvig's
criticisn and advice, and have received from him unprinted Danish
texts, and other aid in many ways.</p>

<p>Such further explanations as to the plan and conduct of the
work as may be desirable can be more conveniently given by and
by. I may say here that textual points which may seem to be
neglected will be considered in an intended Glossary, with which
will be given a full account of Sources, and such indexes of
Titles and Matters as will make it easy to find everything that
the book may contain.</p>

<p>With renewed thanks to all helpers, and helpers' helpers, I
would invoke the largest cooperation for the correction of errors
and the supplying of de ficiencies. To forestall a
misunderstanding which has often occurred, I beg to say that
every traditional version of a popular ballad is desired, no
matter how many texts of the same may have been printed
already.</p>
