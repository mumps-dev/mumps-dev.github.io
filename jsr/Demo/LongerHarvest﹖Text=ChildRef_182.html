<p>Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, a madcap cousin of the
king, had been guilty of a violent assault upon Holyrood House in
December (or September), 1591, and in June, 1592, had " conspired
the apprehension of the king's person " while James was residing
at Falkland. In August following he attempted to force himself
into the king's presence to "make his reconciliation."</p>

<p>"The lairds of Burlie and Logie, delated to [have] had
intelligence with the Earl Bothwell, were taken and apprehended
by the Duke of Lennox the ninth day of August, 1592, and
committed to ward within Dalkeith; where being examined they both
confessed the same. Burley gat his life for telling the truth,
but Logie, being a great courtier with the king, and dealer with
the Earl Bothwell in Bothwell's enterprise which should [have]
been done at Dalkeith, to wit, that they should come in at the
back gate through the yard and [have] gotten the king in their
hands, the said laird of Logie was ordained to be tried by an
assize and executed to the death. But the same night that he was
examined, he escaped out by the means of a gentlewoman whom he
loved, a Dane, who conveyed him out of his keepers' hands,
through the queen's chamber, where his Majesty and the queen were
lying in their beds, to a window in the backside of the place,
where he went down upon a tow [rope], and shot three pistols in
token of his onlouping [mounting his horse] where some of his
servants, with the laird of Niddry, were awaiting him." (Moysie's
Memoirs, p. 95.)</p>

<p>Another account may be added, from The Historie of King James
the Sext (p. 253 f.):</p>

<p>"It fortuned that a gentleman called Wemyss of Logie, being
also in credence at court, was delated as a trafficker with
Francis Earl Bothwell; and he, being examined before king and
council, confessed his accusation to be of verity; that sundry
times he had spoken with him, expressly against the king's
inhibition proclaimed in the contrary; which confession he
subscribed with his hand...</p>

<p>"Queen Anne, our noble princess, was served with divers
gentlewomen of her own country, and namely with one called
Mistress Margaret Twynstoun, to whom this gentleman, Wemyss of
Logie, bore great honest affection, tending to the godly band of
marriage; the which was honestly requited by the said
gentlewoman, yea, even in his greatest mister (need). For how
soon she understood the said gentleman to be in distress, and
apparently by his confession, to be punisht to the death, and she
having privilege to lie in the queen's chamber that same very
night of his accusation, where the king was also reposing that
same night, she came forth of the door privily, both the princes
being then at quiet rest, and past to the chamber where the said
gentleman was put in custody to certain of the guard, and
commanded them that immediately he should be brought to the king
and queen; whereunto they giving sure credence obeyed. But how
soon she was come back to the chamber-door, she desired the
watches to stay till he should come forth again; and so she
closed the door and conveyed the gentleman to a window, where she
ministered a long cord unto him to convey himself down upon, and
so, by her good charitable help, he happily escaped, by the
subtlety of love."</p>

<p>Calderwood gives the following account: "Upon Monday the
seventh of August, the king being in Dalkeith, the young laird of
Logie and Burlie promised to Bothwell to bring him in before the
king to seek his pardon. The king was forewarned, and Bothwell,
howbeit brought in quietly within the castle, was conveyed out
again. Burlie was accused and confessed; Logie denied, and
therefore would have suffered trial. The night before, one of the
queen's dames, Mistress Margaret, a Dutchwoman, came to the guard
and desired that he might be suffered to come to the queen, who
had something to inquire of him. Two of the guard brought him to
the king's chamber-door, and staid upon his coming forth, but she
conveyed him in the mean time out at a window in a pair of
sheets. ... Logie married the gentlewoman after, when he was
received into the king's favor again."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d182_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Logie, according to
Calderwood, was "a varlet of the king's chamber."</p>

<p>Spottiswood says: John Weymis younger of Logie, gentleman of
his Majesty's chamber, and in great favor both with the king and
queen, was discovered to have the like dealing with Bothwell,
and, being committed to the keeping of the guard, escaped by the
policy of one of the Dutch maids, with whom he entertained a
secret love. The gentlewoman, named Mistress Margaret Twinslace,
coming one night, whilst the king and queen were in bed, to his
keepers, shewed that the king called for the prisoner, to ask of
him some question. The keepers, suspecting nothing, for they knew
her to be the principal maid in the chamber, conveyed him to the
door of the bed-chamber, and making a stay without, as they were
commanded, the gentlewoman did let him down at a window, by a
cord that she had prepared. The keepers, waiting upon his return,
staid there till the morning, and then found themselves deceived.
This, with the manner of the escape, ministered great occasion of
laughter; and not many days after, the king being pacified by the
queen's means, he was pardoned, and took to wife the gentlewoman
who had in this sort hazarded her credit for his safety.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d182_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The lady, called by Calderwood and Spottiswood a Dutchwoman,
but rightly by Moysie a Dane, was one of a train of her
country-women who attended Queen Anne when she came to Scotland
in May, 1590. She is called Mistress Margaret Vinstar in a letter
of Robert Bowes to Lord Burghley of August 12, 1592;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d182_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
Margaret Weiksterne in a charter dated 25th December,
1594.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d182_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Young Logie cannot have received a complete pardon within a
few days of his escape. At a council meeting, September 14, 1592,
it is ordered that Wernyss of Logie the younger, having failed to
appear this day to answer touching the 'intercommuning and having
intelligence with Francis, sometime Earl Bothwell,' be denounced
rebel.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d182_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>A</b>. Young Logie is a prisoner, in Carmichael's<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d182_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
keeping, and May Margaret, who is enamored of him, is weeping for
his expected death. The queen can do nothing, and tells her that
she must go to the king himself to beg the life of her lover. She
goes, accordingly, but gets an ill answer: all the gold in
Scotland shall not save Young Logie. In this strait she steals
the king's comb and the queen's knife, and sends them to
Carmichael as tokens that Logie is to be discharged. She provides
the young man with money, and gives him a pair of pistols, which
he is to fire in sign that he is at liberty. The king hears the
'volley' from his bed, and by his peculiar sagacity recognizes
the shot of Young Logie. He sends for Carmichael, and learning
that the prisoner was set free in virtue of a royal token, says,
You will make his place good tomorrow. Carmichael hurries to
Margaret, and wants a word with Logie. Margaret, with a laugh,
tells him that the bird is flown. The young pair severally take
ship and are married.</p>

<p>In <b>B</b>, the queen, instead of referring Margaret to the
king as the only resource, herself undertakes to save the young
man's life. She asks it of her consort as her first boon; the
king makes her the same answer which he gives Margaret in
<b>A</b>, All the gold in Scotland will not buy mercy. Margaret,
in desperation, wishes to kill herself, but the queen will put
her in a better way to save her lover. The queen steals the
prison-keys, and the story proceeds as before. The king threatens
to hang all his gaolers, to the number of thirty and three. The
gaolers plead that they received the keys (which are also thirty
and three) with a strict command to enlarge the prisoner. The
queen says that, if the gaolers are to hang, a beginning must be
made with her.</p>

<p><b>B</b> substitutes Ochiltrie for Logie. Andrew Stewart, Lord
of Ochiltrie, was an active partisan of Bothwell (see the
preceding ballad), and at a council-meeting on May 2, 1594 (the
same meeting at which a caution of three hundred merks was
required for Young Logie), was ordered to be denounced rebel for
not appearing to answer touching his "tressounable attemptattis";
that is, for having been Bothwell's main helper in the Raid of
Leith, April 3 preceding.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d182_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> So far his case resembles Young
Logie's, and it may be that the two became confounded in
tradition earlier than the middle of the eighteenth century,
about which time B was taken down. But an interchange of names is
of the commonest occurrence in traditional ballads, and perhaps
Ochiltrie's appearance here no more requires to be accounted for
than his figuring, as he does, in one of the versions of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_217.html">The Broom of Cowdenknows</a>.'</p>

<p>Although the queen had no hand in the freeing of Young Logie,
and is not known even to have winked at it, she stood by Mistress
Margaret, and refused to give her up when requested.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d182_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>C</b> agrees with <b>B</b> as to the part taken by the
queen in the rescue. There are but three keepers, and presumably
but three keys to steal from under the king's head, and the queen
sends her wedding-ring with the keys, as a warrant to the
keepers. In 5, Anne is queen of England as well as queen of
Scotland; but we cannot expect that a stall-ballad of this
century should be nice about a matter of eleven years.</p>

<p>The offence for which Young Logie is to die in <b>D</b> is the
stealing of a kiss "from the queen's marie," which shows a high
appreciation of the discipline at James's court.</p>

<p>The queen counterfeits the king's hand and steals his right
glove, and sends the forged paper and the glove to "Pitcairn's
walls" as authority for the liberation of the prisoner. The king,
looking over his castle-wall, sees Young Logie approaching, and
his exclamation at the sight brings the queen to an instantaneous
confession of what she has done. The king very good-naturedly
overlooks the offence and absolves the lover for whom it was
committed.</p>
