<p>Of all ballads this has perhaps obtained the widest
circulation. It is nearly as well known to the southern as to the
northern nations of Europe. It has an extraordinary currency in
Poland. The Germans, Low and High, and the Scandinavians,
preserve it, in a full and evidently ancient form, even in the
tradition of this generation. Among the Latin nations it has,
indeed, shrunk to very meagre proportions, and though the best
English forms are not
<a name="Page_I_23"/>
without ancient and distinctive marks, most
of these have been eliminated, and the better ballads are very
brief.</p>

<p><b>A</b> has but thirteen two-line stanzas. An elf-knight, by
blowing his horn, inspires Lady Isabel with love-longing. He
appears on her first breathing a wish for him, and induces her to
ride with him to the greenwood.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Arrived at the wood, he bids
her alight, for she is come to the place where she is to die. He
had slain seven kings' daughters there, and she should be the
eighth. She persuades him to sit down, with his head on her knee,
lulls him asleep with a charm, binds him with his own sword-belt,
and stabs him with his own dagger, saying, If seven kings'
daughters you have slain, lie here a husband to them all.</p>

<p><b>B</b>, in fourteen four-line stanzas, begins unintelligibly
with a bird coming out of a bush for water, and a king's daughter
sighing, "Wae's this heart o mine." A personage not
characterized, but evidently of the same nature as the elf-knight
in <b>A</b>, lulls everybody but this king's daughter asleep with his
harp,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> then mounts her behind him, and rides to a piece of
water called Wearie's Well. He makes her wade in up to her chin;
then tells her that he has drowned seven kings' daughters here,
and she is to be the eighth. She asks him for one kiss before she
dies, and, as he bends over to give it, pitches him from his
saddle into the water, with the words, Since ye have drowned
seven here, I'll make you bridegroom to them all.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>C</b> was first published by David Herd, in the second
edition of his Scottish Songs, 1776, and afterwards by
Motherwell, "collated" with a copy obtained from recitation.
<b>D</b>,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> <b>E</b>, <b>F</b> are all broadside or stall
copies, and in broadside style. <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b> have nearly the same story. False Sir John, a knight
from the south country [west country, north lands], entices May
Colven, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> [a king's daughter, <b>C</b> 16,
<b>E</b> 16; a knight's daughter, Polly, <b>F</b> 4, 9], to ride
off with him, employing, in <b>D</b>, a charm which he has stuck
in her sleeve. At the knight's suggestion, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,
she takes a good sum of money with her, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>. They come to a lonely rocky place by the sea
[river-side, <b>F</b>], and the knight bids her alight: he has
drowned seven ladies here [eight <b>D</b>, six <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>], and she shall be the next. But first she is to strip
off her rich clothes, as being too good to rot in the sea. She
begs him to avert his eyes, for decency's sake, and, getting
behind him, throws him into the water. In <b>F</b> he is absurdly
sent for a sickle, to crop the nettles on the river brim, and is
pushed in while thus occupied.
<a name="Page_I_24"/>
He cries for help, and makes fair
promises, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, but the maid rides away, with a
bitter jest [on his steed, <b>D</b>, leading his steed, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>] , and reaches her father's house before daybreak. The
groom inquires in <b>D</b> about the strange horse, and is told
that it is a found one. The parrot asks what she has been doing,
and is silenced with a bribe; and when the father demands why he
was chatting so early, says he was calling to his mistress to
take away the cat. Here <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b> stop, but
<b>D</b> goes on to relate that the maid at once tells her
parents what has happened, and that the father rides off at dawn,
under her conduct, to find Sir John. They carry off the corpse,
which lay on the sands below the rocks, and bury it, for fear of
discovery.</p>

<p>There is in Hone's Table Book, III, 130, ed. 1841, a
<i>rifacimento</i> by Dixon of the common English broadside in
what passes for old-ballad style. This has been repeated in
Richardson's Borderer's Table Book, VI, 367; in Dixon's Scottish
Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads, p. 101; and, with
alterations, additions, and omissions, in Sheldon's Minstrelsy of
the English Border, p. 194.</p>

<p>Jamieson (1814) had never met with this ballad in Scotland, at
least in anything like a perfect state; but he says that a tale
to the same effect, intermixed with scraps of verse, was familiar
to him when a boy, and that he afterwards found it, "in much the
same state, in the Highlands, in Lochaber and Ardnamurchan."
According to the tradition reported by Jamieson, the murderer
had seduced the younger sister of his wife, and was seeking to
prevent discovery, a difference in the story which might lead us
to doubt the accuracy of Jamieson's recollection. (Illustrations
of Northern Antiquities, p. 348.)</p>

<p>Stories like that of this ballad will inevitably be attached,
and perhaps more or less adapted, to localities where they become
known. May Collean, says Chambers, Scottish Ballads, p. 232,
note, "finds locality in that wild portion of the coast of
Carrick (Ayrshire) which intervenes betwixt Girvan and
Ballantrae. Carlton Castle, about two miles to the south of
Girvan (a tall old ruin, situated on the brink of a bank which
overhangs the sea, and which gives title to Sir John Cathcart,
Bart, of Carlton), is affirmed by the country people, who still
remember the story with great freshness, to have been the
residence of 'the fause Sir John;' while a tall rocky eminence
called Gamesloup, overhanging the sea about two miles still
further south, and over which the road passes in a style terrible
to all travellers, is pointed out as the place where he was in
the habit of drowning his wives, and where he was finally drowned
himself. The people, who look upon the ballad as a regular and
proper record of an unquestionable fact, farther affirm that May
Collean was a daughter of the family of Kennedy of Colzean," etc.
Binyan's (Bunion) Bay, in <b>D</b>, is, according to Buchan, the old
name of the mouth of the river Ugie.</p>

<p>Far better preserved than the English, and marked with very
ancient and impressive traits, is the <b>Dutch</b> ballad 'Halewijn,'
which, not many years ago, was extensively sung in Brabant and
Flanders, and is still popular as a broadside, both oral
tradition and printed copies exhibiting manifold variations. A
version of this ballad (<b>A</b>) was communicated by Willems to Mone's
Anzeiger in 1836, col. 448 ff, thirty-eight two-line stanzas, and
afterwards appeared in Willems's Oude vlaemsche Liederen (1848),
No 49, p. 116, with some changes in the text and some various
readings. Uhland, I, 153, 74 D, gave the Anzeiger text, with
one correction. So Hoffmann, Niederl&auml;ndische Volkslieder, 2d
ed., No 9, p. 39, but substituting for stanzas 19, 20 four
stanzas from the margin of O. v. L., and making other slighter
changes. Baecker, Chants historiques de la Flandre, No 9, p. 61,
repeats Willems's second text, with one careless omission and one
transposition. Coussemaker, Chants populaires des Flamands de
France, No 45, p. 142, professes to give the text of Oude
vlaemsche Liederen, and does so nearly. Snellaert, Oude en nieuwe
Liedjes, 3d ed., 1864, No 55, p. 58, inserts seven stanzas in the
place of 33, 34 of O. v. L., and two after 35, making forty-five
two- (or three-) line stanzas instead of thirty-eight. These
additions are also found in an
<a name="Page_I_25"/>
excessively corrupt form of the
ballad (<b>B</b>), Hoffmann, No 10, p. 43, in which the stanzas
have been uniformly extended to three verses, to suit the air,
which required the repetition of the second line of the original
stanza.</p>

</p>

<p>Heer Halewijn (<b>A</b>), like the English elf-knight, sang
such a song that those who heard it longed to be with him. A
king's daughter asked her father if she might go to Halewijn. No,
he said; those who go that way never come back [sixteen have lost
their lives, <b>B</b>]. So said mother and sister, but her
brother's answer was, I care not where you go, so long as you
keep your honor. She dressed herself splendidly, took the best
horse from her father's stable, and rode to the wood, where she
found Halewijn waiting for her.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> They then rode on further,
till they came to a gallows, on which many women were hanging.
Halewijn says, Since you are the fairest maid, choose your death
[<b>B</b> 20 offers the choice between hanging and the sword]. She
calmly chooses the sword. "Only take off your coat first, for a
maid's blood spirts a great way, and it would be a pity to
spatter you." His head was off before his coat, but the tongue
still spake. This dialogue ensues:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp; </td>
<td valign="top" align="left">'Go yonder into the corn,<br/>
And blow upon my horn,<br/>
That all my friends you may warn.'</td>

<td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp; </td>
<td valign="top" align="left">'Into the corn I will not go,<br/>

<td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp; </td>

<td valign="top" align="left">'Under the gallows I will not go,<br/>

</tr>

</table>

<p>She takes the head by the hair and washes it in a spring, and
rides back through the wood. Half-way through she meets
Halewijn's mother, who asks after her son; and she tells her that
he is gone hunting, that he will never be seen again, that he is
dead, and she has his head in her lap. When she came to her
father's gate, she blew the horn like any man.</p>

</tr>

</table>

<p>Snellaert's copy and the modern three-line ballad have a
meeting with father, brother, sister, and mother successively.
The maid's answer to each of the first three is that Halewijn is
amusing himself with sixteen maids, or to that effect, but to the
mother that he is dead, and she has his head in her lap. The
mother angrily replies, in <b>B</b>, that if she had given this
information earlier she would not have got so far on her way
home. The maid retorts, Wicked woman, you are lucky not to have
been served as your son; then rides, "like Judith wise,"
straight to her father's palace, where she blows the horn
blithely, and is received with honor and love by the whole
court.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Another Flemish version (<b>C</b>) has been late ly published
under the title, 'Roland,' by which only, we are informed, is
this particular form known in Bruges and many parts of
<a name="Page_I_26"/>
Flanders:<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Chants populaires recueillis &agrave; Bruges par
Adolphe Lootens et J.M.E. Feys, No 37, p. 60, 183 vv, in
sixty-three stanzas, of two, three, four, or five lines. This
text dates from the last century, and is given with the most
exact fidelity to tradition. It agrees with <b>A</b> as to some main
points, but differs not a little as to others. The story sets out
thus:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp; </td>
<td valign="top" align="left">It was a bold Roland,<br/>
He loved a lass from England;<br/>
He wist not how to get her,<br/>
With reading or with writing,<br/>
With brawling or with fighting.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Roland has lost Halewyn's art of singing. Louise asks her
father if she may go to Roland, to the fair, as all her friends
do. Her father refuses: Roland is "een stoute kalant," a bad
fellow that betrays pretty maids; he stands with a drawn sword in
his hand, and all his soldiers in armor. The daughter says she
has seen Roland more than once, and that the tale about the drawn
sword and soldiers is not true. This scene is exactly repeated
with mother and brother. Louise then tries her shrift-father. He
is easier, and does not care where she goes, provided she keeps
her honor and does not shame her parents. She tells father,
mother, and brother that she has leave from her confessor, makes
her toilet as in <b>A</b>, takes the finest horse in the stable, and
rides to the wood. There she successively meets Roland's father,
mother, and brother, each of whom asks her where she is going,
and whether she has any right to the crown she wears. To all she
replies, Whether I have or not, be off; I know you not. She does
not encounter Roland in the wood, they do not ride together, and
there is no gallows-field. She enters Roland's house, where he is
lying abed. He bids her gather three rose-wreaths "at his hands"
and three at his feet; but when she approaches the foot of the
bed he rises, and offers her the choice to lose her honor or
kneel before the sword. She chooses the sword, advises him to
spare his coat, and, while he is taking it off, strikes off his
head, all as in <b>A</b>. The head speaks: Go under the gallows (of
which we have heard nothing hitherto), fetch a pot of salve, rub
it on my wounds, and they shall straight be well. She declines to
follow a murderer's rede, or to learn magic. The head bids her go
under the blue stone and fetch a pot of maidens-grease, which
also will heal the wounds. This again she refuses to do, in the
same terms; then seizes the head by the hair, washes it in a
spring, and rides off with it through the wood, duly meeting
Roland's father, mother, and brother once more, all of whom
challenge her, and to all of whom she answers,</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp; </td>
<td valign="top" align="left">Roland your son is long ago dead;<br/>
God has his soul and I his head;<br/>

<p>The four older versions, and also <b>E</b>, open with some
lines that occur at the beginning of other ballads.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In
<b>A</b> and <b>E</b>, and, we may add, <b>G</b>, the maid is
allured by the promise of being taken to a paradise exempt from
death and sorrow; <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b> promise a train of
handmaids and splendid presents. All the versions agree very well
as to the kernel of the story. A false knight prevails upon a
lady to elope with him, and they ride to a wood [they simply meet
in a wood, <b>H</b>, <b>K</b>]. He sets to work digging a grave,
which she says is too long for his [her] dog and too narrow for
his [her] horse [all but <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>]. She is told that
the grave is for her. He has taken away the life [and honor,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>I</b>] of eight maids, and she shall be
the ninth. The eight maids become nine kings' daughters in
<b>E</b>, ten in <b>F</b>, nineteen in <b>G</b>, and in <b>E</b>
and <b>F</b> the hard choice is offered of death by sword, tree,
or stream. In <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b> the knight
bids the lady get her gold together before she sets out with him,
and in <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b> he points out a
little knoll under which he keeps the gold of his previous
victims. The maid now induces the knight to lie down with his
head in her lap, professing a fond desire to render him the most
homely of services<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a><a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_074','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> [not in <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>,

<b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b> that she shall not betray him in his
sleep, and she calls Heaven to witness that she will not. In
<b>G</b> she sings him to sleep. He slept a sleep that was not
sweet. She binds him land and foot, then cries, Wake up! I will
not betray you in sleep.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Eight you have killed; yourself
shall be the ninth. Entreaties and fair promises and pretences
that he had been in jest, and desire for shrift, are in vain.
Woman-fashion she drew his sword, but man-fashion she cut him
down. She went home a maid.</p>

<p><b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, however, do not end so simply.
On her way home through the wood [<b>E</b>], she comes upon a
maid who is working gold, and who says, The last time I saw that
horse my brother rode it. She answers, Your brother is dead, and
will do no more murdering for gold; then turns her horse, and
sets the sister's bower on fire. Next she encounters seven
robbers on the heath, who recognize the horse as their master's,
and are informed of his death and of the end of his crimes. They
ask about the fire. She says it is an old pig-sty. She rides on,
and they call to her that she is losing her horse's gold shoe.
But nothing can stop her; she bids them pick it up and drink it
in wine; and so comes home to her father's. <b>F</b> has nothing
of the sister; in place of seven robbers there are nine of the
robber's brothers, and the maid sets their house on fire.
<b>G</b> indulges in absurd extravagances: the heroine meets the
robber's sister with twelve fierce dogs, and then his twelve
swains, and cuts down both dogs and swains.</p>

<p>The names in the Danish ballads are, <b>A</b>, Ulver and
V&aelig;nelil; <b>B</b>, Olmor, or Oldemor, and Vindelraad;
<b>C</b>, Hollemen and Vendelraad; <b>D</b>, Romor, Reimord, or
Reimvord, and the maid unnamed; <b>F</b>, Herr Peder and Liden
Kirsten; <b>H</b>-<b>L</b>, Ribold, Rigbold [<b>I</b>, Rimmelil]
and Guldborg.</p>

<p>Four <b>Swedish</b> versions are known, all from tradition of this
century. <b>A</b>, 'Den Falske Riddaren,' twenty-three two-line
stanzas, Arwidsson, 44 B, I, 301. <b>B</b>, 'R&ouml;fvaren Brun,'
fifteen stanzas, Afzelius, 83, III, 97. <b>C</b>, twenty-seven
<a name="Page_I_28"/>
stanzas, Arwidsson, 44 A, I, 298. <b>D</b>, 'R&ouml;fvaren
Rymer,' sixteen stanzas, Afzelius, 82, III, 94. <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b> have resemblances, at the beginning, to the
Ribold ballads, like the Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>G</b>, while the beginning of <b>C</b> is like the Danish
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>. <b>A</b> has the grave-digging;
there have been eight maids before; the knight lays his head in
the lady's lap for the same reason as in most of the Danish
ballads, and under the same assurance that he shall not be
betrayed in sleep; he is bound, and conscientiously waked before
his head is struck off; and the lady rides home to her father's.
There have been eight previous victims in <b>C</b>, and they
king's daughters; in <b>B</b>, eleven (maids); <b>D</b> says not
how many, but, according to an explanation of the woman that sang
it, there were seven princesses. <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, like Danish
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, make the maid encounter some of the
robber's family on the way home. By a misconception, as we
perceive by the Dutch ballad, she is represented as blowing the
robber's horn. Seven sisters come at the familiar sound to bury
the murdered girl and share the booty, but find that they have
their brother to bury.</p>

<p>The woman has no name in any of the Swedish ballads. <b>A</b>
calls the robber "an outlandish man" (en man ifr&aring;n
fremmande land), <b>B</b>, simple Brun, <b>C</b>, a knight, and
<b>D</b>, Riddaren Rymer, or Herr Rymer.</p>

<p>Of <b>Norwegian</b> versions, but two have been printed: <b>A</b>,
'Svein Nor&eth;mann,' twenty-two line stanzas, Landstad, 69, p. 567;
<b>B</b>, 'Rullemann og Hildeborg,' thirty stanzas, Landstad, 70, p.
571, both from recent recitation. Bugge has communicated eight
others to Grundtvig. Both <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> have the paradise
at the beginning, which is found in Danish <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>G</b>, and Swedish <b>D</b>. In both the lady gets her gold
together while the swain is saddling his horse. They come to a
grave already dug, which in <b>B</b> is said to be made so very
wide because Rulleman has already laid nine maidens in it. The
stanza in <b>A</b> which should give the number is lost, but the
reciter or singer put it at seven or nine. The maid gets the
robber into her power by the usual artifice, with a slight
variation in <b>B</b>. According to <b>A</b>, she rides straight
home to her father. <b>B</b>, like Danish <b>F</b>, has an
encounter with her false lover's [five] brothers. They ask, Where
is Rullemann, thy truelove? She answers, He is lying down, in the
green mead, and bloody is his bridal bed.</p>

<p>Of the unprinted versions obtained by Professor Bugge, two
indicate that the murderer's sleep was induced by a spell, as in
English <b>A</b>. <b>F</b> 9 has,</p>

<p>And <b>H</b> 18, as also a variant to <b>B</b> 20, says it was
a rune-slumber that came over him. Only <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>K</b> give the number of the murdered women: in
<b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, eight, in <b>I</b>, nine, in <b>K</b>,
five.</p>

<p>The names are, in <b>A</b>, Svein Nor&eth;mann and Gu&eth;bjorg;
<b>B</b>, Rulleman and Hildeborg [or Signe]; <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,

<p>Such information as has transpired concerning Icelandic
versions of this ballad is furnished by Grundtvig, IV, 4.

 The
Icelandic form, though curtailed and much, injured, has shown
tenacity enough to preserve itself in a series of closely
agreeing copies from the 17th century down. The eldest, from a
manuscript of 1665, runs thus:</p>

<p>The German ballads, as Grundtvig has pointed out, divide into
three well-marked classes. The first class, embracing the
versions <b>A</b>-<b>F</b> (6), and coming nearest to English and
Dutch tradition, has been found along the lower half of the Rhine
and in Westphalia, or in Northwest Germany; the second, including
<b>G</b>-<b>S</b> (13), is met with in Swabia, Switzerland,
Bohemia, Moravia, Styria, Carniola, or in South Germany; the
third, <b>T</b>-<b>Z</b> (7), in East Prussia, the eastern part
of Brandenburg and of Saxony, Silesia, and, again, Moravia, or,
roughly speaking, in North and East Germany; but, besides the
Moravian, there is also of this third class one version, in two
copies, from the Rhine.</p>

<p>(<b>I</b>.) <b>A</b> runs thus. She that would ride out with
Gert Olbert must dress in silk and gold. When fair Helena had so
attired herself, she called from her window, Gert Olbert, come
and fetch the bride. He took her by her silken gown and swung her
on behind him, and they rode three days and nights. Helena then
said, We must eat and drink; but Gert Olbert said, We must go on
further. They rode over the green heath, and Helena once more
tenderly asked for refreshment. Under yon fir [linden], said Gert
Olbert, and kept on till they came to a green spot, where nine
maids were hanging. Then it was, Wilt thou choose the fir-tree,
the running stream, or the naked sword? She chose the sword, but
begged him to take off his silken coat, "for a maid's blood
spirts far, and I should be sorry to spatter it." While he was
engaged in drawing off his coat, she cut off his head. But still
the false tongue spoke. It bade her blow in his horn; then she
would have company enough. She was not so simple as to do this.
She rode three days and nights, and blew the horn when she
reached her father's castle. Then all the murderers came running,
like hounds after a hare. Frau Clara [Jutte] called out, Where is
my son? Under the fir-tree, sporting with nine maids; he meant
me to be the tenth, said Helena.</p>

<p><b>B</b> is the same story told of a margrave and Fair Annie,
but some important early stanzas are lost, and the final ones
have suffered injury; for the ballad ends with this conceit, "
She put the horn to her mouth, and blew the margrave quite out of
her heart." Here, by a transference exceedingly common in
tradition, it is the man, and not the maid, that "would ride in
velvet and silk and red gold."</p>

<p><b>C</b> a has the names Odilia and Hilsinger, a trooper
(reiter). Odilia was early left an orphan, and as she grew up
"she grew into
<a name="Page_I_31"/>
the trooper's bosom." He offered her seven pounds
of gold to be his, and "she thought seven pounds of gold a good
thing." We now fall into the track of <b>A</b>. Odilia dresses herself
like a bride, and calls to the trooper to come and get her. They
ride first to a high hill, where she asks to eat and drink, and
then go on to a linden-tree, on which seven maids are hanging.
The choice of three deaths is offered, the sword chosen, he is
entreated to spare his coat, she seizes his sword and hews off
his head. The false tongue suggests blowing the horn. Odilia
thinks "much biding or blowing is not good." She rides away, and
presently meets the trooper's "little foot-page" (bot), who
fancies she has Hilsinger's horse and sword. "He sleeps," she
says, "with seven maids, and thought I was to be the eighth."
This copy concludes with a manifestly spurious stanza. <b>C</b>
<b>b</b> agrees with <b>C</b> <b>a</b> for ten stanzas, as to the
matter, and so far seems to be <b>C</b> <b>a</b> improved by
Zuccalmaglio, with such substitutions as a princely castle for
"seven pounds of gold." The last stanza (11),</p>

<p>was, no doubt, suggested by the last of <b>F</b>, an other of
Zuccalmaglio's versions, and, if genuine, would belong to a
ballad of the third class.</p>

<p><b>D</b> has the name Odilia for the maid,
but the knight, or trooper, has become expressly a robber
(ritter, reiter, r&auml;uber). They ride to a green heath, where there
is a cool spring. Odilia asks for and gets a draught of water,
and is told that at the linden-tree there will be eating and
drinking for them. And when they come to the linden, there hang
six, seven maids! All proceeds as before. The talking head is
lost. Odilia meets the robber's mother, and makes the usual
reply.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>E</b> resembles <b>C</b> closely. 'Odilia becomes Schondilg
(Sch&ouml;n Odilie), R&auml;uber returns to Ritter, or Reiter, and the
servant-maid bribe of seven pounds of gold rises to ten
tons.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Schondilg's toilet, preparatory to going off (6-8),
is described with a minuteness that we find only in the Dutch
ballad (12-16). After this, there is no important variation. She
meets the trooper's three brothers, and makes the same replies to
them as to the mother in <b>D</b>.</p>

<p><b>F</b>. The personages here are Linnich (i.e., Nellie) and a
knight from England. The first twelve stanzas do not diverge from
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>. In stanza 13 we find the knight
directing the lady to strip off her silk gown and gold necklace,
as in the English <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>; but certainly
this inversion of the procedure which obtains in German <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b> is an accident arising from confused
recollection. The 14th and last stanza similarly misunderstands
the maid's feigned anxiety about the knight's fine coat, and
brings the ballad to a false close, resembling the termination of
those of the third class, still more those of certain mixed forms
to be spoken of presently.</p>

<p>(<b>II</b>.) The second series, <b>G</b>-<b>S</b>, has three
or four traits that are not found in the foregoing ballads.
<b>G</b>, which, as well as <b>H</b>, was in print more than two
hundred years before any other copy is known to have been taken
down, begins, like the Dutch Halewijn, with a knight (Ulinger)
singing so sweetly that a maid (Fridburg) is filled with desire
to go off with him. He promises to teach her his art. This
magical song is wanting only in <b>R</b>, of class <b>II</b>, and
the promise to teach it only in <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>. She attires
herself splendidly; he swings her on to his horse behind him, and
they ride to a wood. When they came to the wood there was no one
there but a white dove on a hazelbush, that sang, Listen,

in his clutches. Fridburg asked what the dove was saying. Ulinger
replied, It takes me for another; it lies in its red bill; and
rode on till it suited him to alight. He spread his cloak on the
grass, and asked her to sit down:</p>

<p><b>H</b>, the nearly contemporaneous Augsburg broadside,
differs from <b>G</b> in only one important particular. The
"reuter" is Adelger, the lady unnamed. A stanza is lost between 6
and 7, which should contain the warning of the dove, and so is
Adelger's version of what the bird had said. The important
feature in <b>H</b>, not present in <b>G</b>, is that the halt is
made near a spring, about which blood is streaming, "der war mit
blut <input type="hidden" id="SpanToggle_26" value="0"/><span id="Span_26" onclick="GetText(this,'d004',26);"><img alt="Correction in Volume 1" title="Correction in Volume 1" src="../image/Ballads/plus.gif"/><sup>1</sup>umbrunnenn<img alt="Correction in Volume 1" title="Correction in Volume 1" src="../image/Ballads/plus.gif"/></span>." This adds a horror to this powerful scene which
well suits with it. When the maid begins to weep, Adelger asks
whether her tears are for her father's land, or because she
dislikes him so much. It is for neither reason, but because on
yon fir she sees eleven maids hanging. He confirms her fears:</p>

</tr>

</table>

<p>The last two lines seem, by their form, to be the dove's
warning that has dropped out between stanzas 6 and 7. The maid's
clothes in <b>H</b> are destined to be the perquisite of
Adelger's mother, and the brother says that Adelger's are to go
to his shield-bearer. The unhappy maid cries but twice, to the
Virgin and to her brother. When surprised by the broth er,
Adelger feigns to be twisting a withe for his falcon.</p>

<p><b>I</b> begins, like <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, with the knight's
seductive song. Instead of the dove directly warning the maid, it
upbraids the man: "Whither now, thou Ollegehr?<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_020','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Eight hast
thou murdered already; and now for the ninth!" The maid asks what
the dove means, and is told to ride on, and not mind the dove,
who takes him for another man. There are eight maids in the fir.
The cries are to Jesus, Mary, and her brothers, one of whom
hastens to the rescue. He is struck with the beauty of his
sister's attire, her velvet dress, her virginal crown, "which you
shall wear many a year yet." So saying, he draws his sword, and
whips off his "brother-in-law's" head, with this epicedium:</p>

<p>In <b>J</b>, again, the knight comes riding through the reeds,
and sings such a song that Brown Annele, lying under the
casement, exclaims, "Could I but sing like him, I would give my
troth and my honor!" There are, by mistake, two<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_022','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> doves in
stanza 4, that warn Annele not to be beguiled, but this error is
set right in the next stanza. When she asks what the dove is
cooing, the answer is, "It is cooing about its red foot; it went
barefoot all winter." We have here again, as in <b>H</b>, the
spring in the wood, "mit Blute umrunnen," and the lady asks again
the meaning of the bloody spring. The knight replies, in a stanza
which seems both corrupted and out of place, "This is where the
eleven pure virgins perished." Then follow the same incidents as
in <b>G</b>-<b>I</b>. He says she must hang with the eleven in
the fir, and be queen over all. Her cries are for her father, for
Our Lady, and for her brother, who is a hunter in the forest. The
hunter makes all haste to his sister, twists a withe, and hangs
the knight without a word between them, then takes his sister by
the hand and conducts her home, with the advice never more to
trust a knight: for all which she returns her devout
thanks.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_023','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>K</b> and <b>L</b> are of the same length and the same
tenor as <b>J</b>. There are no names in <b>L</b>; in <b>K</b>
both Annele and Ulrich, but the latter is very likely to have
been inserted by the editor. <b>K</b>, <b>L</b> have only one
dove, and in neither does the lady ask the meaning of the dove's
song. The knight simply says, "Be still; thou liest in thy
throat!" Both have the bloody spring, but out of place, for it is
very improperly spoken of by the knight as the spot he is making
for:</p>

<p>The three cries are for father, mother, brother. In <b>K</b>
the brother fights with "Ulrich" two hours and a half before he
can master him, then despatches him with his two-edged sword,
and hangs him in a withe. He fires his rifle in <b>L</b>, to
announce his coming, and hears his sister's laugh; then stabs the
knight through the heart. The moral of <b>J</b> is repeated in
both: Stay at home, and trust no knight.</p>

<p><b>M</b> smacks decidedly of the b&auml;nkels&auml;nger, 
and has an appropriate moral at the tail: 
<i>animi index cauda!</i> The characters are a 
cavalier and a girl, both nameless, and a 
brother. The girl, hearing the knight sing 
"ein Liedchen von dreierlei Stimmen," which 
should seem to signify a three-part song, says, 
"Ah, could I sing like him, I would straight 
way give him my honor." They ride to the 
wood, and come upon a hazel-bush with <i>three</i> 
doves, one of which informs the maid that 
she will be betrayed, the second that she will 
die that day, and the third that she will be 
buried in the wood. The second and third 
doves, as being false prophets, and for other 
reasons, may safely be pronounced intruders. 
All is now lost till we come to the cries, which 
are addressed to father, mother, and brother.

<p><b>N</b> is as short as <b>M</b>, and, like it, has no names,
but has all the principal points: the fascinating song, the dove
on the bush, eleven maids in the fir, the three cries, and the
rescue by the huntsman-brother, who cocks his gun and shoots the
knight. The reciter of this ballad gave the editor to understand
that if the robber had succeeded in his twelfth murder, he would
have attained such powers that nobody after that could harm
him.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_026','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>O</b> is a fairly well-preserved ballad, resembling
<b>G</b>-<b>J</b> as to the course of the story. Anneli, lying
under the casement, hears the knight singing as he rides through
the reeds. The elaborate toilet is omitted, as in <b>I</b>,
<b>J</b>. The knight makes haste to the dark wood. They come to a
cold spring, "mit Bluot war er &uuml;berrunnen;" then to a hazel,
behind which a dove coos ominously. Anneli says, Listen. The dove
coos you are a false man, that will not spare my life. No, says
the knight, that is not it; the dove is cooing about its blue
foot, for its fate is to freeze in winter. The cloak is thrown
on the grass, the eleven maids in the fir are descried, and
Anneli is told she must hang highest, and be empress over all. He
concedes her as many cries as she likes, for only the wood-birds
will hear. She calls on God, the Virgin, and her brother. The
brother thinks he hears his sister's voice, calls to his groom to
saddle, comes upon the knight while he is twisting a withe for
his horse, as he says, ties him to the end of the withe, and
makes him pay for all he has perpetrated in the wood. He then
swings Anneli behind him, and rides home with her.</p>

<p><b>P</b>, the other Swiss ballad, has been
<a name="Page_I_35"/>
retouched, and more
than retouched in places, by a modern pen. Still the substance of
the story, and, on the whole, the popular tone, is preserved.
Fair Anneli, in the miller's house, hears the knight singing as
he rides through the rushes, and runs down-stairs and calls to
him: she would go off with him if she could sing like that, and
her clothes are fit for any young lady. The knight promises that
he will teach her his song if she will go with him, and bids her
put these fine clothes on. They ride to the wood. A dove calls
from the hazel, "He will betray thee." Anneli asks what the dove
is saying, and is answered much as in <b>J</b> and <b>O</b>, that
it is talking about its frost-bitten feet and claws. The knight
tears through the wood, to the great peril of Anneli's gown and
limbs, and when he has come to the right place, spreads his cloak
on the grass, and makes the usual request. She weeps when she
sees eleven maids in the fir-tree, and receives the customary
consolation:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp; </td>
<td valign="top" align="left">'Weep not too sore, my Anneli,<br/>
'T is true thou art doomed the twelfth to be;<br/>
Up to the highest tip must thou go,<br/>
And a margravine be to all below;<br/>
Must be an empress over the rest,<br/>
And hang the highest of all as the best.'</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The request to be allowed three cries is lost. The knight
tells her to cry as much as she pleases, he knows no one will
come; the wild birds will not hear, and the doves are hushed. She
cries to father, mother, and brother. The brother, who is sitting
over his wine at the inn, hears, saddles his best horse, rides
furiously, and comes first to a spring filled with locks of
maid's hair and red with maid's blood; then to a bush, where the
knight (R&uuml;deli, Rudolph) is twisting his withe. He bids his
sister be silent, for the withe is not for her; the villain is
twisting it for his own neck, and shall be dragged at the tail of
his horse.</p>

<p><b>Q</b> resembles the Swabian ballads, and presents only
these variations from the regular story. The dove adds to the
warning "Fair maid, be not beguiled," what we find nowhere else,
"Yonder I see a cool spring, around which blood is running." The
knight, to remove the maid's anxiety, says, "Let it talk; it does
not know me; I am no such murderer." The end is excessively
feeble. When the brother, a hunter as before, reaches his sister,
"a robber runs away," and then the brother takes her by the
hand, conducts her to her father's land, and enjoins her to stay
at home and spin silk. There are no names.</p>

<p>There is one feature entirely peculiar to <b>R</b>. The knight
carries off the maid, as before, but when they come to the hazel
bush there are eleven doves that sing this "new song:"</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp; </td>
<td valign="top" align="left">'Be not beguiled, maiden,<br/>
The knight is beguiling thee:</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp; </td>
<td valign="top" align="left">'We are eleven already,<br/>
Thou shalt be the twelfth.'</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The eleven doves are of course the spirits of the eleven
preceding victims. The maid's inquiry as to what they mean is
lost. The knight's evasion is not ingenious, but more likely to
allay suspicion than simply saying, "I am no such murderer." He
says, "Fear not: the doves are singing a song that is common in
these parts." When they come to the spring "where blood and water
are running," and the maid asks what strange spring is this, the
knight answers in the same way, and perhaps could not do better:
"Fear not: <i>there is</i> in these parts a spring that runs blood and
water." This spring is misplaced, for it occurs before they enter
the wood. The last scene in the ballad is incomplete, and goes no
further than the brother's exclamation when he comes in upon the
knight: "Stop, young knight! Spare my sister's life." The parties
in <b>R</b> are nameless.</p>

<p>So again in <b>S</b>, which also has neither the knight's
enchanting song nor the bloody spring. There are two doves, as in
<b>J</b>, stanza 4. The cries are addressed to mother, father,
brother, as in <b>N</b>, and, as in <b>N</b>, again, the brother
cocks his gun, and shoots the knight down;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_027','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> then calmly
leads his sister home, with the warning against knights.</p>

<a name="Page_I_36"/>
<p>(<b>III</b>.) <b>T</b>, the first of the third series, has
marked signs of deterioration. Ulrich does not enchant &Auml;nnchen by
his song, and promise to teach it to her; he offers to teach her
"bird-song." They <i>walk</i> out together, apparently, and come to a
hazel, with no dove; neither is there any spring. Annie sits down
on the grass; Ulrich lays his head in her lap; she weeps, and he
asks why. It is for eleven maids in the fir-tree, as so often
before. Ulrich's style has become much tamer:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp; </td>
<td valign="top" align="left">'Ah, Annie, Annie, dear to me,<br/>
How soon shalt thou the twelfth one be!'</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>She begs for three cries, and calls to her father, to God, to
her youngest brother. The last is sitting over the wine and
hears. He demands of Ulrich where she is, and is told, Upon yon
linden, spinning silk. Then ensues this dialogue: Why are your
shoes blood-red? Why not? I have shot a dove. That dove my mother
bare under her breast. Annie is laid in the grave, and angels
sing over her; Ulrich is broken on the wheel, and round him the
ravens cry.</p>

<p>There is no remnant or reminiscence of the magical singing in
<b>U</b>. Sch&ouml;n Ulrich and Roth &Auml;nnchen go on a walk, and
come first to a fir-tree, then a green mead. The next scene is
exactly as in <b>T</b>. Ulrich says the eleven maids were his
wives, and that he had thrust his sword through their hearts.
Annie asks for three <i>sighs</i>, and directs them to God, to Jesus,
and to her youngest brother. He is sitting over his wine, when
the sigh comes into the window, and Ulrich simultaneously in at
the door. The remainder is very much as in <b>T</b>.</p>

<p><b>V</b> differs from <b>U</b> only in the names, which are
Sch&ouml;n-Heinrich and Sch&ouml;n-&Auml;nnelein, and in the
"sighs" returning to cries, which invoke God, father, and
brother.</p>

<p><b>W</b> begins with a rivalry between Ulrich and
Hanselein<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_028','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> for the hand of Rautendelein (Rautendchen).
Ulrich is successful. She packs up her jewels, and he takes her
to a wood, where she sees eleven maids hanging. He assures her
she shall presently be the twelfth. It is then they sit down, and
she leans her head on his breast and weeps, "because," as she
says, "I must die." His remark upon this, if there was any, is
lost. Hoffmann inserts a stanza from another Silesian copy, in
which Ulrich says, Rather than spare thy life, I will run an iron
stake through, thee. She asks for three cries, and he says, Four,
if you want. She prefers four, and calls to her father, mother,
sister, brother. The brother, as he sits over the wine, hears the
cry, and almost instantly Ulrich comes in at the door. He
pretends to have killed a dove; the brother knows what dove, and
hews off Ulrich's head, with a speech like that in <b>I</b>.
Still, as Rautendchen is brought to the grave, with toll of
bells, so Ulrich is mounted on the wheel, where ravens shriek
over him.</p>

<p><b>X</b>. Albrecht and H&auml;nselein woo Alalein. She is promised
to Albrecht, but H&auml;nsel gets her. He takes her to a green mead,
spreads his mantle on the grass, and she sits down. His lying in
her lap and her discovery of the awful tree are lost. She weeps,
and he tells her she shall be "his eleventh." Her cries are
condensed into one stanza:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp; </td>
<td valign="top" align="left">'Gott Vater, Sohn, Heir Jesu Christ,<br/>
Mein j&uuml;ngster Bruder, wo Du bist!'</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Her brother rides in the direction of the voice, and meets
H&auml;nselein in the wood, who says Alalein is sitting with princes
and counts. The conclusion is as in <b>T</b>, <b>U</b>,
<b>V</b>.</p>

<p><b>Y</b> has Ansar Uleraich wooing a king's daughter, Annie,
to the eighth year. He takes her to a fir-wood, then to a fir, a
stump of a tree, a spring; in each case bidding her sit down. At
the spring he asks her if she
<a name="Page_I_37"/>
wishes to be drowned, and, upon her
saying no, cuts off her head. He has not walked half a mile
before he meets her brother. The brother inquires where Ulrich
has left his sister, and the reply is, "By the green Rhine." The
conclusion is as in <b>W</b>. Ulrich loses his head, and the
brother pronounces the imprecation which is found there and in
<b>I</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_029','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>Z</b>, which takes us back from Eastern Germany to the
Rhine, combines features from all the three groups. Ulrich
fascinates a king's daughter by his song. She collects her gold
and jewels, as in <b>W</b>, and goes to a wood, where a dove warns her
that she will be betrayed. Ulrich appropriates her valuables, and
they wander about till they come to the Rhine. There he takes her
into a wood, and gives her a choice between hanging and drowning,
and, &mdash; she declining both, says she shall die by his sword. But
first she is allowed three cries, to God, her parents, her
youngest brother. The youngest brother demands of Ulrich where he
has left his sister. "Look in my pocket, and you shall find fourteen
tongues, and the last cut [reddest] of all is your
sister's." The words were scarcely out of his mouth before
Ulrich's sword had taken off his head.</p>

<p>The three classes of the German ballad, it will be observed,
have for their principal distinction that in I the maid saves her
own life by an artifice, and takes the life of her treacherous
suitor; in II, she is rescued by her brother, who also kills the
traitor; in III, she dies by the villain's hand, and he by her
brother's, or by a public execution. There are certain
subordinate traits which are constant, or nearly so, in each
class. In <b>I</b>, <b>A</b>-<b>F</b>, a choice of deaths is
invariably offered; the maid gets the advantage of the murderer
by persuading him to take off his coat [distorted in <b>F</b>,
which has lost its conclusion]; and, on her way home, she falls
in with one or more of the robber's family, mother, brothers,
servant, who interrogate her [except <b>F</b>, which, as just said, is a
fragment]. Class II has several marks of its own. All the
thirteen ballads [<b>G</b>-<b>S</b>], except the last, represent
the knight as fascinating the maid by his singing; in all but
<b>Q</b> she is warned of her danger by a dove,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_030','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> or more than
one; in all but the much-abridged <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, the knight
spreads his cloak on the grass, they sit down, and, excepting
<b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>R</b>, the unromantic service is repeated<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_074','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
which she undertakes in Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>,
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. The bloody spring occurs in some
form, though often not quite intelligible, in <b>H</b>, <b>J</b>,
<b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b> (also
in <b>D</b>, <b>Y</b>). All but the much-abridged <b>M</b>,
<b>N</b> have the question, What are you weeping for? your
father's land, humbled pride, lost honor? etc.; but this question
recurs in <b>T</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>W</b>. The cries for
help are a feature of both the second and the third class, and
are wanting only in <b>Y</b>. Class III differs from I, and
resembles II, in having the cries for help, and, in the less
impaired forms, <b>T</b>-<b>W</b>, the knight spreads his cloak,
lies down with his head in the lady's lap, and asks the cause of
her tears. Beyond this, and the changed catastrophe, the ballads
of Class III are distinguished by what they have lost.</p>

<p>Forms in which the story of this is mixed with that of some
other German ballad remain to be noticed.

<p><b>A</b>. A ballad first published in Nicolai's Almanach, II,
100, No 21 (1778), and since reprinted, under the titles, 'Liebe
ohne Stand,' 'Der Ritter und die K&ouml;nigstochter,' etc., but
never with absolute fidelity, in Wunderhorn (1819), I, 37
(= Erlach, II, 120), Kretzschmer, No 72, I, 129; Mittler, No 89;
Erk, Neue Sammlung, iii, 18, No 14; also, with a few changes, by
Zuccalmaglio, No. 95, p. 199, as 'aus Schwaben;' by Erk,
Liederhort, No 28, p. 90, as "corrected from oral tradition;" and
as "from oral tradition," in Erk's Wunderhorn (1857), I, 39.
Independent versions are given by Mittler, No 90, p. 83, from
Oberhessen; Pr&ouml;hle, Weltliche u. geistliche Volkslieder, No 5, p.
10, from the Harz; Reifferscheid, No 18, p. 36, from Bokendorf.
Erk refers to still another copy, five stanzas longer

</p>

<p>What other ballad is here combined with Ulinger, it is
impossible to make out. The substance of the narrative is that a
knight rides singing through the reeds, and is heard by a king's
daughter, who forthwith desires to go with him. They ride till
the horse is hungry [tired]; he spreads his cloak on the grass,
and makes, <i>sans fa&ccedil;on</i>, his usual request. The king's daughter
sheds many tears, and he asks why. "Had I followed my father's
counsel, I might have been empress." The knight cuts off her head
at the word, and says, Had you held your tongue, you would have
kept your head. He throws the body behind a tree, with Lie there
and rot; my young heart must mourn [no knight, a knight, shall
mourn over thee]. Another stanza or two, found in some versions,
need not be particularly noticed.</p>

<p>'Stolz Sieburg,' Simrock, No 8, p. 21, from 
the Rhine, Mittler, No 88, is another and somewhat
more rational form of the same story. 
To the question whether she is weeping for 
Gut, Muth, Ehre, the king's daughter answers:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp; </td>
<td valign="top" align="left">'Ich wein um meine Ehre, <br/>
Ich wollt gern wieder umkehren.'</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>For this Stolz Sieburg strikes off her head, with a speech
like that which we have just had, and throws it into a spring;
then resolves to hang himself.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_031','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A <b>Dutch</b> version of this ballad, Le Jeune, No 92, p. 292;
Willems, No 72, p. 186; Hoffmann, No 29, p. 92, has less of the
Halewyn in it, and more motive than the German, though less
romance. "If you might have been an empress," says the knight,
"I, a margrave's son, will marry you to-morrow." "I would rather
lose my head than be your wife," replies the lady; upon which he
cuts off her head and throws it into a fountain, saying, Lie
there, smiling mouth! Many a thousand pound have you cost me, and
many pence of red gold. Your head is clean cut off.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. The Ulinger story is also found combined with that
of the beautiful ballad, 'Wassermanns Braut.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_032','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> (1.) In a
Transylvanian ballad, 'Brautm&ouml;rder,' Schuster,
Siebenb&uuml;rgisch-s&auml;chsische Volkslieder, p. 57, No 54 A, 38
vv, with variations, and p. 59, <b>B</b>, a fragment of 10 vv;
(<b>A</b> in a translation, B&ouml;hme, No 14, p. 61.) A king from the
Rhine sues seven years for a king's daughter, and does not
prevail till the eighth. She begs her mother not to consent, for
she has seen it in the sun that she shall not long be her
daughter, in the moon that she shall drown before the year is
out, in the bright stars that her blood shall be dispersed far
and wide. He takes her by the hand, and leads her through a green
wood, at the end of which a grave is already made. He pushes her
into the grave, and drives a stake through her heart. The
princess' brother asks what has become of his sister. "I left her
on the Rhine, drinking mead and wine." "Why are your skirts so
bloody?" "I have shot a turtle-dove." "That turtle-dove was,
mayhap, my sister." They spit him on a red-hot stake, and roast
him like a fish. Lines 1-4 of this ballad correspond to 1-4 of
<b>Y</b> (which last agree with 1-4 of Meinert's 'Wassermanns
Braut'); 17, 18, to <b>Y</b> 5, 6; 25-34 to 21-30; and we find in
verse 22 the stake through the heart which Hoffmann has
interpolated in <b>W</b>, stanza 12.</p>

to Deutsches Museum, 1852, II, 164, represents the
bride, after she has fallen into the water and has been recovered
by the nix, as asking for three cries, and goes on from this
point like the Ulrich ballad <b>W</b>, the conclusion being that
the sister is drowned before the brother comes to her
aid.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_033','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>'Nun sch&uuml;rz dich, Gredlein,' "Forster's Frische Liedlein,
No 66," B&ouml;hme, No 53, Uhland, No 256 A, which is of the date
1549, and therefore older than the Nuremberg and Augsburg
broadsides, has derived stanzas 7-9 from an Ulinger ballad,
unless this passage is to be regarded as common property. Some
copies of the ballad commonly called 'M&uuml;llert&uuml;cke' have
also adopted verses from Ulinger, especially that in Meier's
Schw&auml;bische Volkslieder, No 233, p. 403.</p>

<p>A form of ballad resembling English <b>C</b>-<b>F</b>, but
with some important differences, is extraordinarily diffused in
Poland. There is also a single version of the general type of
English <b>A</b>, or, better, of the first class of the German ballads.
This version, <b>A</b>, Pauli, Pie&#347;&#324;i ludu Polskiego w Galicyi, p. 90,
No 5, and Kolberg, Pie&#347;ni ludu Polskiego, No 5, bbb, p. 70, runs
thus. There was a man who went about the world wiling away young
girls from father and mother. He had already done this with
eight; he was now carrying off the ninth. He took her to a
frightful wood; then bade her look in the direction of her house.
She asked, "What is that white thing that I see on yon fir?"
"There are already eight of them," he said, "and you shall be the
ninth; never shall you go back to your father and mother. Take
off that gown, Maria." Maria was looking at his sword. "Don't
touch, Maria, for you will wound your pretty little hands."
"Don't mind my hands, John," she replied, "but rather see what a
bold heart I have;" and instantly John's head flew off. Then
follows a single stanza, which seems to be addressed to John's
mother, after the manner of the German <b>A</b>, etc.: "See, dear
mother! I am thy daughter-in-law, who have just put that traitor
out of the world." There is a moral for conclusion, which is
certainly a later addition.</p>

<p>The story of the larger part of these ballads, conveyed as

her take silver and gold enough, that the horse may have
something to carry. Catherine says her mother will not allow her
to enter the new chamber. Tell her that you have a headache, says
John, and she will consent. Catherine feigns a headache, is put

The brother who plays so important a part in the second class of
German ballads, appears also in a few of the Polish versions,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, and <b>L</b>*, <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>,
<b>Q</b>, <b>X</b>, but is a mere shadow. In <b>B</b> 21, 22, and
<b>C</b> 16, 17, the brother, who is "on the mountain," and may
be supposed to hear the girl's cry, slides down a silken cord,
which proves too short, and the girl "adds her tress"!<input type="hidden" id="SpanToggle_56" value="0"/><span id="Span_56" onclick="GetText(this,'d004',56);"><img alt="Addition in Volume 1" title="Addition in Volume 1" src="../image/Ballads/plus.gif"/>[1]<img alt="Addition in Volume 1" title="Addition in Volume 1" src="../image/Ballads/plus.gif"/></span> He asks
the fishermen to throw their nets for her. She is rescued, goes
to church, takes an humble place behind the door, and, when her
eyes fall on the young girls, melts into tears. Her apron catches
in a bush in <b>D</b>: she plucks a leaf, and sends it down the
stream to her mother's house.<input type="hidden" id="SpanToggle_58" value="0"/><span id="Span_58" onclick="GetText(this,'d004',58);"><img alt="Addition in Volume 1" title="Addition in Volume 1" src="../image/Ballads/plus.gif"/>[1]<img alt="Addition in Volume 1" title="Addition in Volume 1" src="../image/Ballads/plus.gif"/></span> The mother says to the father, "Do
you not see how Catherine is perishing?" The leaf is next sent
down stream to her sister's house, who says to her brother, "Do
you not see how Catherine is perishing? "He rides up a high
mountain, and slides down his silken cord. Though one or two
stanzas are lost, or not given, the termination was probably the
same as in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. In <b>L</b>* 15, <b>O</b> 12, the
brother, on a high mountain, hears the cry for help, and slides
down to his sister on a silken cord, but does nothing. <b>X</b>
does not account for the brother's appearance: he informs the
fishermen of what has happened, and they draw Catherine out,
evidently dead. The brother hears the cry from the top of a wall
in <b>P</b> 21, 22; slides down his cord; the sister adds her
tress; he directs the fishermen to draw her out; she is dead.
Instead of the brother on the wall, we have a mason in <b>Q</b>
27 [perhaps "the brother on the wall" in <b>P</b> <i>is</i> a mason]. It
is simply said that "he added" a silken cord: the fishermen drew
out Catherine dead. The conclusion is equally, or more, impotent
in all the versions in which the girl escapes from drowning. In

apostrophizes her hair, saying [in <b>G</b>, <input type="hidden" id="SpanToggle_60" value="0"/><span id="Span_60" onclick="GetText(this,'d004',60);"><img alt="Correction in Volume 1" title="Correction in Volume 1" src="../image/Ballads/plus.gif"/><sup>1</sup><b>I</b>}=<b>J</b>}*}], "Dry, my<img alt="Correction in Volume 1" title="Correction in Volume 1" src="../image/Ballads/plus.gif"/></span>

goes to church, takes an humble place, and weeps, in <b>E</b>,

<p>There is a Little-Russian ballad which begins like the Polish
'J&aacute;s i Kasia,' but ends with the girl being tied to a tree
and burned, instead of being drowned: Wis&#322;a, IV, 423, from
Zbi&oacute;r wiadom. do antrop., III, 150, No 17. Traces of the
incident of the burning are also found in Polish and Moravian
songs: Wis&#322;a, pp. 418-22. It is probable that there were two
independent ballads, and that these have been confounded.}+}</p>

<p>There are, besides, in various ballads of this second class,
special resemblances to other European forms. The man (to whom
rank of any sort is assigned only in <b>N</b><a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_039','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>) comes from a
distant country, or from over the border, in <b>O</b>, <b>Q</b>,
<b>R</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>DD</b>, <b>GG</b>, as in

<b>W</b>, as in German <b>G</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>O</b>,
<b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, etc. In <b>Q</b> 2, John, who has come from
over the border, persuades the maid to go with him by telling her
that in his country "the mountains are golden, the mountains are
of gold, the ways of silk," reminding us of the wonderland in
Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, etc. After the pair have stolen away,
they go one hundred and thirty miles, <b>O</b>, <b>DD</b>,
<b>FF</b>; thrice nine miles, <b>Q</b>; nine and a half
miles, <b>T</b>; cross one field and another, <b>M</b>, <b>R</b>;
travel all night, <b>GG</b>; and neither says a word to
the other. We shall find this trait further on in French
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, Italian <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>F</b>, <b>G</b>. The choice of deaths which we find in German
<b>A</b>-<b>F</b> appears in <b>J</b>. Here, after passing
through a silent wood, they arrive at the border of the (red)
<i>sea</i>. She sits down on a stone, he on a rotten tree. He asks, By
which death will you die: by my right hand, or by drowning in
this <i>river</i>? They come to a dark wood in <b>AA</b>; he seats himself on a
beech-trunk, she near a stream. He asks, Will you throw your self
into the river, or go home to your mother? So <b>H</b>, and

<p>Other Slavic forms of this ballad resemble more or less the
third German class. A <b>Wendish</b> version from Upper Lusatia, Haupt
and Schmaler, Part I, No 1, p. 27, makes Hil&#382;i&#269;ka (Lizzie) go
out before dawn to cut grass. Ho&#322;dra&#353;k suddenly appears, and says
she must pay him some forfeit for trespassing in his wood. She
has nothing but her sickle, her silver finger-ring, and, when
these are rejected, her wreath, and that, she says, he shall not
have if she dies for it. Ho&#322;dra&#353;k, who avows that he has had a
fancy for her seven years (cf. German <b>Y</b>, and the Transylvanian
mixed form <b>B</b>), gives her her choice, to be cut to pieces by his
sword, or trampled to death by his horse. Which way pleases him,
she says, only she begs for three cries. All three are for her
brothers. They ride round the wood twice, seeing nobody; the
third time Ho&#322;dra&#353;k comes up to them. Then follows the dialogue
about the bloody sword and the dove. When asked where he has left
Hil&#382;i&#269;ka, Ho&#322;dra&#353;k is silent. The elder brother seizes him, the
younger dispatches him with his sword.</p>

<p>Very similar is a Bohemian ballad, translated in Waldau's
B&ouml;hmische Granaten, II, 25.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_042','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> While Katie is cutting
grass, early in the morning, Indriasch presents himself, and
demands some for his horse. She says, You must dismount, if your
horse is to have grass. "If I do, I will take away your wreath."
"Then God will not grant you his blessing." He springs from his
horse, and while he gives
<a name="Page_I_42"/>
it grass with one hand snatches at the
wreath with the other. "Will you die, or surrender your wreath?"
Take my life, she says, but allow me three cries. Two cries
reached no human ear, but the third cry her mother heard, and
called to her sons to saddle, for Katie was culling in the wood,
and was in trouble. They rode over stock and stone, and came to a
brook where Indriasch was washing his hands. The same dialogue
ensues as in the Wendish ballad. The brothers hewed the murderer
into fragments.</p>

<p>A <b>Servian</b> ballad has fainter but unmistakable traces of the

L. der Serben, 2d ed., II, 172, by Kapper, Ges&auml;nge der Serben, II,
318. Mara is warned by her mother not to dance with Thomas. She
disobeys. Thomas, while dancing, gives a sign to his servants to
bring horses. The two ride off, and when they come to the end of
a field Thomas says, Seest thou yon withered maple? There thou
shalt hang, ravens eat out thine eyes, eagles beat thee with
their wings. Mara shrieks, Ah me! so be it with every girl that
does not take her mother's advice.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_043','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>French</b>. This ballad is well known in France, and is generally
found in a form resembling the English; that is to say, the scene
of the attempted murder is the sea or a river (as in no other but
the Polish), and the lady delivers herself by an artifice. One
French version nearly approaches Polish <b>O</b>-<b>CC</b>.</p>

Renauld carried off the king's daughter. When they were gone
half-way, she called to him that she was dying of hunger (cf.
German <b>A</b>-<b>F</b>). Eat your hand, he answered, for you
will never eat bread again. When they had come to the middle of
the wood, she called out that she was dying of thirst. Drink your
blood, he said, for you will never drink wine again. When they
came to the edge of the wood, he said, Do you see that river?
Fourteen dames have been drowned there, and you shall be the
fifteenth. When they came to the river-bank, he bade her put off
her cloak, her shift. It is not for knights, she said, to see
ladies in such plight; they should bandage their eyes with a
handkerchief. This Renauld did, and the fair one threw him into
the river. He laid hold of a branch; she cut it off with his
sword (cf. the Polish ballad, where the catastrophe, and
consequently this act, is reversed). "What will they say if you
go back without your lover?" "I will tell them that I did for you

blood. "Drink it, for you never will drink wine. Over there is a
pond in which fifteen ladies have had a bath, have drowned
themselves, and you will make sixteen." Arrived at the pond, he
orders her to take off her clothes. She tells him to put his

the fair one asks for a drink. The man says, incoherently enough,
Before drinking of this white wine I mean to drink your blood.
The stanza that should tell how many have been drowned before is
lost. Jeanneton, having been ordered to strip, pushes the "beau
galant" into the sea, while, at her request, he is pulling off
her stockings. He catches at a branch; she cuts it off, and will
not hear to his entreaties.</p>

cavalier meets three fair maids, mounts the fairest behind him,
and rides a hundred leagues without speaking to her, at the end
of which she asks to drink. He takes her to a spring, but when
there she does not care to drink. The rest of the ballad is
pointless, and shows that the original story has been completely
forgotten.

pop. du Velay et du Forez, Romania, X, 198, resembles the common
Polish ballad. Pierre rouses his love early in the morning, to
take a ride with him. He mounts her on his horse, and when they
come to a lonesome wood bids her alight, for it is the last of
her days. He plunges his sword into her heart, and throws her
into a river. Her father and mother come searching for her, and
are informed of her fate by a shepherdess, who had witnessed the
murder. The youngest of her three brothers plunges into the
water, exclaiming, Who threw you in? An angel descends, and
tells him it was her lover. A less romantic version, described in
a note, treats of a valet who is tired of an amour with a
servant-girl. He is judicially condemned to be hanged <i>or</i>
burned.</p>

<p>'La Fille de Saint-Martin de l'Ile,' Bujeaud, II, 226, has the
conclusion of the third class of German ballads. A mother incites
her son to make away with his wife. He carries her off on his
horse to a wheat-field [wood], and kills her with sword and
dagger. Returning, he meets his wife's brother, who asks why his
shoes are covered with blood. He says he has been killing
rabbits. The brother replies, I see by your paleness that you
have been killing my sister. So G&eacute;rard de Nerval, Les Filles du
Feu, &OElig;uvres Com., V, 134, and La Boheme galante (1866), p. 79:
'Rosine,' Chants pop. du Velay, etc., Romania, X, 197.

<p>The ballad is known over all North Italy, 
and always nearly in one shape.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. 'Monchisa,' sixty-four short verses, Bernoni, Canti
popolari veneziani, Puntata v, No 2. A count's son asks Monchesa,
a knight's daughter, in marriage in the evening, espouses her in
the morning, and immediately carries her off. When they are
"half-way," she heaves a sigh, which she says is for father and
mother, whom she shall no more see. The count points out his
castle; he has taken thirty-six maids there, robbed them of their
honor, and cut off their heads. "So will I do with you when we
are there." The lady says no word till she is asked why she is
silent; then requests the count to lend her his sword; she wishes
to cut a branch to shade her horse. The moment she gets the sword
in her hand, she plunges it into his heart; then throws the body
into a ditch. On her way back, she meets her brother, whom she
tells that she is looking after the assassins who have killed her
husband. He fears it was she; this she denies, but afterwards
says she must go to Rome to confess a great sin. There she
obtains prompt absolution.</p>

Here it is the daughter of a
count that marries Malpreso, the son of a knight. He takes her to
France immediately. She goes sixty miles (<b>b</b>) without speaking.
She confesses to her brother what she has done.</p>

<p><b>C</b>. Righi, Canti popolari veronesi, 58 vv, No 94*, p.
30. The count's son marries Mampresa, a knight's daughter. For
thirty-six miles she does not speak; after five more she sighs.
She denies to her brother having killed her husband, but still
says she must go to the pope to confess an old sin; then owns
what she has done.</p>

<p><b>D</b>. 'La Monferrina,' 48 vv, Nigra, Canzoni popolari del
Piemonte, in Rivista Contemporanea, XXIV, 76. The lady is a
Monferrina, daughter of a knight. After the marriage they travel
fifty miles without speaking to one another. Fifty-two Monferrine
have losf their heads; the bridegroom does not say why. She goes
to the Pope to confess.</p>

<p><b>E</b>. 'La Vendicatrice,' an incomplete copy from
Alexandria, 18 vv only, Marcoaldi, Canti popolari, No 12, p. 166,
like <b>D</b>, as far as it goes. Thirty-three have been beheaded
before.</p>

<p><b>F</b>. 'La Inglese,' 40 vv, Ferraro, Canti popolari di
Ferrara, Cento e Pontelagoscuro, No 2, p. 14. The count's son
marries an English girl, daughter of a knight. She never speaks
for more than three hundred miles; after two hundred more she
sighs. She denies having killed her husband; has not a heart of
that kind.</p>

<p><b>G</b>. 'La Liberatrice,' 24 vv, Ferraro, Canti popolari
monferrini, No 3, p. 4. Gianfleisa is the lady's name. When
invited to go off, she says, If you wish me to go, lend me a
horse. Not a word is spoken for five hundred miles. The man
(Gilardu) points out his castle, and says that no one he has
taken there has ever come back. Gianfleisa goes home without
meeting anybody.</p>

<p>Several other French and Italian ballads have common points
with Renauld, Monchisa, etc., and for this have sometimes been
improperly grouped with them: e.g., 'La Fille des Sables,'
Bujeaud, II, 177 ff. A girl sitting by the water-side hears a
sailor sing, and asks him to teach her the song. He says, Come
aboard, and I will. He pushes off, and by and by she begins to
weep.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_046','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> She says, My father is calling me to supper. "You will sup
with me." "My mother is calling me to bed." "You will sleep with
me." They go a hundred leagues, and not a word said, and at last
reach his father's castle. When she is undressing, her lace gets
into a knot. He suggests that his sword would cut it. She plunges
the sword into her heart. So 'Du Beau Marinier,' Beaurepaire, p.
57 f, and Po&eacute;sies populaires de la France, manuscript, III, fol.
59, No 4; 'L'&Eacute;p&eacute;e Liberatrice,' V. Smith, Chansons
du Velay, etc., Romania, VII, 69, nearly; also 'Il Corsaro,'
Nigra, Rivista Contemporanea, XXIV, p. 86 ff. In 'La Monferrina
Incontaminata,' Ferraro, C. p. m., No 2, p. 3, a French knight
invites a girl to go off with him, and mounts her behind him.
They ride five hundred miles without speaking, then reach an inn,
after which the story is the same. So Bernoni, Puntata IX, No 2.
'La Fille du Patissier,' <input type="hidden" id="SpanToggle_108" value="0"/><span id="Span_108" onclick="GetText(this,'d004',108);"><img alt="Correction in Volume 1" title="Correction in Volume 1" src="../image/Ballads/plus.gif"/><sup>1</sup>Paymaigre<img alt="Correction in Volume 1" title="Correction in Volume 1" src="../image/Ballads/plus.gif"/></span>, No 30, p. 93, has the same
conclusion. All these, except 'La Fille des Sables,' make the
girl ask for the sword herself, and in all it is herself that she
kills.</p>

The king's huntsmen got no game, and lost the
falcons. They betook
<a name="Page_I_45"/>
themselves to the castle of Maynes, where
was a beautiful damsel, sought by seven counts and three kings.
Rico Franco of Aragon carried her off by force. Nothing is said
of a rest in a wood, or elsewhere; but that something has dropped
out here is shown by the corresponding Portuguese ballad. The
lady wept. Rico Franco comforted her thus: If you are weeping
for father and mother, you shall never see them more; and if for
your brothers, I have killed them all three. I am not weeping for
them, she said, but because I know not what my fate is to be.
Lend me your knife to cut the fringes from my mantle, for they
are no longer fit to wear. This Rico Franco did, and the damsel
thrust the knife into his breast. Thus she avenged father,
mother, and brothers.</p>

<p>A <b>Portuguese</b> ballad has recently been obtained from tradition
in the island of St. George, Azores, which resembles the Spanish
closely, but is even curter: <b>A</b>, 'Romance de Dom Franco,'
30 vv; <b>B</b>, 'Dona Inez,' a fragment of 18 vv; Braga, Cantos
populares do Archipelago a&ccedil;oriano, No 48, p. 316, No 49,
p. 317: Hartung's Romanceiro, II, 61, 63. Dona Inez was so
precious in the eyes of her parents that they gave her neither to
duke nor marquis. A knight who was passing [the Duke of Turkey,
<b>B</b>] took a fancy to her, and stole her away. When they came
to the middle of the mountain ridge on which Dona Inez lived, the
knight stopped to rest, and she be gan to weep. From this point
Portuguese <b>A</b>, and <b>B</b> so far as it is preserved,
agree very nearly with the Spanish.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_047','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Certain Breton ballads have points of contact with the
Halewyn-Ulinger class, but, like the French and Italian ballads
mentioned on the preceding page, have more important divergences,
and especially the characteristic distinction that the woman
kills herself to preserve her honor. 1. 'Jeanne Le Roux,' Luzel,
I, 324 ff, in two versions; Po&eacute;sies pop. de la France,
manuscript, III, fol. 182. The sieur La Tremblaie attempts the abduction
of Jeanne from the church immediately after her marriage
ceremony. As he is about to compel her to get up on the crupper
of his horse, she asks for a knife to cut her bridal girdle,
which had been drawn too tight. He gives her the choice of three,
and she stabs herself in the heart. La Tremblaie <i>remarks</i>, I have
carried off eighteen young brides, and Jeanne is the nineteenth,
words evidently taken from the mouth of a Halewyn, and not
belonging here. 2. Le Marquis de Coatredrez, Luzel, I, 336 ff,
meets a young girl on the road, going to the pardon of Gu&eacute;odet,
and forces her on to his horse. On the way and at his house she
vainly implores help. He takes her to the garden to gather
flowers. She asks for his knife to shorten the stems, and kills
herself. Early in the morning the door of the ch&acirc;teau is broken
in by Kerninon, foster-brother of the victim, who forces
Coatredrez to fight, and runs him through. 3. 'Rozmelchon,'
Luzel, I, 308 ff, in three versions, and, 4, 'La Filleule de du
Guesclin,' Villemarqu&eacute;, Barzaz-Breiz, 6th ed., 212 ff, are very
like 2. The wicked Rozmelchon is burned in his ch&acirc;teau in Luzel's
first copy; the other two do not bring him to punishment.
Villemarqu&eacute;'s villain is an Englishman, and has his head cloven
by du Guesclin. 5. 'Marivonnic,' Luzel, I, 350 ff.

a pretty young
girl, is carried off by an English vessel, the captain of which

<p><b>Magyar</b>. Five versions from recent traditions, all of them
interesting, are given in Arany and Gyulai's collection of
Hungarian popular poetry, 'Moln&aacute;r Anna,' I, 137 ff, Nos
l-5.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_048','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> &mdash; <b>A</b>, p. 141, No 3. A man, nameless here, but
called in the other versions
<a name="Page_I_46"/>
Martin Ajg&oacute;, or Martin
Sajg&oacute;, invites Anna Miller to go off with him. She
refuses; she has a young child and a kind husband. "Come," he
says; "I have six palaces, and will put you in the seventh," and
persists so long that he prevails at last. They went a long way,
till they came to the middle of a green wood. He asked her to sit
down in the shade of a branchy tree (so all); he would lie in her
lap, and she was to look into his head (a point found in all the
copies). But look not up into the tree, he said. He went to sleep
(so <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>); she looked up into the tree, and saw six
fair maids hanging there (so all but <b>E</b>). She thought to
herself, He will make me the seventh! (also <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>).
A tear fell on the face of the "brave sir," and waked him. You
have looked up into the tree, he said. "No, but three orphans
passed, and I thought of my child." He bade her go up into the
tree. She was not used to go first, she said. He led the way. She
seized the opportunity, tore his sword from its sheath (so
<b>C</b>), and hewed off his head. She then wrapped herself in
his cloak, sprang upon his horse, and returned home, where (in
all the copies, as in this) she effected a reconcilement with her
husband. <b>B</b>, p. 138, No 2, agrees closely with the
foregoing. Martin Ajg&oacute; calls to Anna Miller to come with
him a long way into the wilderness (so <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>). He
boasts of no palaces in this version. He calls Anna a long time,
tempts her a long time, drags her on to his horse, and carries
her off. The scene under the tree is repeated. Anna pretends (so
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>) that the tear which drops on Martin's face is
dew from the tree, and he retorts, How can it be dew from the
tree, when the time is high noon? His sword falls out of its
sheath as he is mounting the tree, and he asks her to hand it to
him. She throws it up (so <b>E</b>), and it cuts his throat in
two. Rightly served, Martin Ajg&oacute;, she says: why did you
lure me from home? <b>C</b>, p. 144, No 4. Martin Sajg&oacute;
tells Anna Miller that he has six stone castles, and is building
a seventh. It is not said that he goes to sleep. As in <b>A</b>,
Anna pulls his sword from the scabbard. <b>D</b>, p. 146, No 5.
Here reappears the very important feature of the wonderland:
"Come, let us go, Anna Miller, a long journey into the
wilderness, to a place that flows with milk and honey." Anna
insists, as before, that Martin shall go up the tree first. He
puts down his sword; she seizes it, and strikes off his head with
one blow. <b>E</b>, p. 137, No 1, is somewhat defective, but
agrees essentially with the others. Martin Ajg&oacute; calls Anna; she
will not come; he carries her off. He lets his sword fall as he
is climbing, and asks Anna to hand it up to him. She throws it
up, as in <b>B</b>, and it cuts his back in two.</p>

<p>Neus, in his Ehstnische Volkslieder, maintains the affinity of
'Kallewisohnes Tod,' No 2, p. 5, with the Ulinger ballads, and
even of his Holepi with the Dutch Halewyn. The resemblance is of
the most distant, and what there is must be regarded as casual.
The same of the Finnish 'Kojoins Sohn,' Schr&ouml;ter, Finnische
Runen, p. 114, 115; 'Kojosen Poika,' L&ouml;nnrot, Kanteletar, p.
279.</p>

<p>In places where a ballad has once been known, the story will
often be remembered after the verses have been wholly or partly
forgotten, and the ballad will be resolved into a prose tale,
retaining, perhaps, some scraps of verse, and not infrequently
taking up new matter, or blending with other traditions.
Naturally enough, a ballad and an equivalent tale sometimes exist
side by side. It has already been mentioned that Jamieson, who
had not found this ballad in Scotland, had often come upon the
story in the form of a tale interspersed with verse. Birlinger at
one time (1860) had not been able to obtain the ballad in the
Swabian Oberland (where it has since been found in several
forms), but only a story agreeing essentially with the second
class of German ballads. According to this tradition, a robber,
who was at the same time a portentous magician, enticed the
twelve daughters of a miller, one after another, into a wood, and
hanged eleven of them on a tree, but was arrested by a hunter,
the brother of the twelve, before he could dispatch the last, and
was handed over to justice. The object of the murders was to
obtain blood for magical purposes. This story had, so to speak,
<a name="Page_I_47"/>
naturalized itself in the locality, and the place where the
robber's house had been and that where the tree had stood were
pointed out. The hunter-brother was by some conceived of as the
Wild Huntsman, and came to the rescue through the air with a
fearful baying of dogs. (Birlinger in Volksth&uuml;mliches aus
Schwaben, I, 368, No 592, and Germania, 1st Ser., V, 372.)</p>

<p>The story of the German ballad <b>P</b> has attached itself to
localities in the neighborhood of Weissenbach, Aargau, and is
told with modifications that connect it with the history of the
Guggi-, or Schongauer-, bad. A rich man by lewd living had become
a leper. The devil put it into his head that he could be cured by
bathing in the blood of twelve [seven] pure maidens. He seized
eleven at a swoop, while they were on their way to church, and
hanged them, and the next day enticed away a miller's daughter,
who was delivered from death as in the ballad. A medicinal spring
rose near the fatal tree. (Rochholz, I, 22.) No pure version of
this ballad has been obtained in the Harz region, though a mixed
form has already been spoken of; but 'Der Reiter in Seiden,'
Pr&ouml;hle, M&auml;rchen f&uuml;r die Jugend, No 32, p. 136,
which comes from the western Harz, or from some place further
north, on the line between Kyffha&uuml;ser and Hamburg, is,
roughly speaking, only 'Gert Olbert' turned into prose, with a
verse or two remaining. 'Der betrogene Betr&uuml;ger,' from
M&uuml;hlbach, M&uuml;ller's Siebenb&uuml;rgische Sagen, No 418, p.
309, has for its hero a handsome young man, addicted to women,
who obtains from the devil the power of making them follow his
piping, on the terms that every twelfth soul is to be the devil's
share. He had taken eleven to a wood, and hanged them on a tree
after he had satisfied his desire. The brother of a twelfth
substituted himself for his sister, dressed in her clothes,
snatched the rope from the miscreant, and ran him up on the
nearest bough; upon which a voice was heard in the wind, that
cried The twelfth soul is mine. Grundtvig, in his Engelske og
skotske Folkeviser, p. 249, gives his recollections of a story
that he had heard in his youth which has a catastrophe resembling
that of English <b>C</b>-<b>F</b>. A charcoal burner had a way of
taking up women beside him on his wagon, and driving them into a
wood, where he forced them to take off their clothes, then killed
them, and sunk them with heavy stones in a deep moss. At last a
girl whom he had carried off in this way got the advantage of him
by inducing him to turn away while she was undressing, and then
pushing him into the moss. Something similar is found in the
conclusion of a robber story in Grundtvig's Danske Folkeminder,
1861, No 30, p. 108, and in a modern Danish ballad cited in
Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, IV, 24, note.**</p>

<p>Another Transylvanian tale, Schuster, p. 433, has a fountain,
a thirsty bride, and doves (two or three) that sing to her,
traits which have perhaps been derived from some Ulinger ballad;
but the fountain is of an entirely different character, and the
doves serve a different purpose. The tale is a variety of
'Fitchers Vogel,' Grimms, No 46, and belongs to the class of
stories to which Bluebeard,' from its extensive popularity, has
given name. The magician of 'Fitcher's Vogel' and of 'Bluebeard'
becomes, or remains, a preternatural being (a hill-man) further
north, as in Grundtvig's Gamle danske Minder, 1857, No 312, p.
182. There is a manifest affinity between these three species of
tales and our ballad (also between the German and Danish tales
and the Scandinavian ballad of 'Rosmer'), but the precise nature
of this affinity it is impossible to expound. 'Bluebeard,' 'La
Barbe Bleue,' Perrault, Histoires ou Contes du temps pass&eacute;,
1697, p. 57 (Lef&egrave;vre), has a special resemblance to the German
ballads of the second class in the four calls to sister Anne,
which represent the cries to father, mother, and brother, and
agrees with these ballads as to the means by which the death of
the malefactor is brought about.</p>

<p>Looking back now over the whole field covered by this ballad,
we observe that the framework of the story is essentially the
same in English, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian; in the first
class of the German ballads; in Polish <b>A</b>; in French, Italian,
Spanish, Portuguese, and Magyar. The woman delivers
<a name="Page_I_48"/>
herself from
death by some artifice,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_049','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and retaliates upon the man the
destruction he had intended for her. The second form of the
German ballad attributes the deliverance of the woman to her
brother, and also the punishment of the murderer. The third form
of the German ballad makes the woman lose her life, and her
murderer, for the most part, to suffer the penalty of the law,
though in some cases the brother takes immediate vengeance.
Polish <b>B</b>-<b>K</b> may be ranked with the second German
class, and <b>O</b>-<b>CC</b> still better with the third; but
the brother appears in only a few of these, and, when he appears,
counts for nothing. The Wendish and the Bohemian ballad have the
incident of fraternal vengeance, though otherwise less like the
German. The Servian ballad, a slight thing at best, is still less
like, but ranks with the third German class. The oldest
Icelandic copy is altogether anomalous, and also incomplete, but
seems to imply the death of the woman: later copies suffer the
woman to escape, without vengeance upon the murderer.</p>

<p>It is quite beyond question that the third class of German
ballad is a derivation from the second.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_050','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Of the versions
<b>T</b>-<b>Z</b>, <b>Z</b> alone has preserved clear traits of
the marvellous. A king's daughter is enticed from home by
Ulrich's singing, and is warned of her impending fate by the
dove, as in Class II. The other ballads have the usual marks of
degeneracy, a dropping or obscuring of marvellous and romantic
incidents, and a declension in the rank and style of the
characters. <b>T</b>, to be sure, has a hazel, and <b>Y</b> a
tree-stump and a spring, and in <b>T</b> Ulrich offers to teach
&Aacute;nnchen bird-song, but these traits have lost all
significance. Knight and lady sink to ordinary man and maid; for
though in <b>Y</b> the woman is called a king's daughter, the
opening stanzas of <b>Y</b> are borrowed from a different ballad.
Ulrich retains so much of the knight that he rides to
&Auml;nnchen's house, in the first stanza of <b>T</b>, but he
apparently goes on foot with her to the wood, and this is the
rule in all the other ballads of this class. As Ulrich has lost
his horse, so the brother, in <b>T</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>,
<b>X</b>, has lost his sword, or the use of it, and in all these
(also, superfluously, in <b>W</b>) Ulrich, like a common felon as
he was, is broken on the wheel.</p>

<p>That the woman should save her life by her own craft and
courage is certainly a more primitive conception than that she
should depend upon her brother, and the priority of this
arrangement of the plot is supported, if not independently
proved, by the concurrence, as to this point, of so many copies
among so many nations, as also by the accordance of various
popular tales. The second German form must therefore, so far
forth, be regarded as a modification of the first. Among the
several devices, again, which the woman employs in order to get
the murderer into her power, the original would seem to be her
inducing him to lay his head in her lap, which gives her the
opportunity (by the use of charms or runes, in English <b>A</b>,
Danish <b>G</b>, Norwegian <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, and one form of
<b>B</b>) to put him into a deep sleep. The success of this trick
no doubt implies considerable simplicity on the part of the
victim of it; not more, however, than is else where witnessed in
preternatural beings, whose wits are frequently represented as ho
match for human shrewdness. Some of the Scandinavian ballads are
not liable to the full force of this objection, whatever that may
be, for they make the knight express a suspicion of treachery,
and the lady solemnly asseverate that she will not kill [fool,
beguile] him in his sleep. And so, when he is fast bound, she
cries out, Wake up, for I will not kill thee <i>in thy sleep!</i>
This last circumstance is wanting in hardly any of the
Scandinavian ballads, where as the previous compact is found only
in Danish <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>,
Swedish <b>A</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, and the Icelandic ballad.
Not occurring in any of the older Danish copies, it may be that
<a name="Page_I_49"/>
the compact is an after-thought, and was inserted to qualify the
improbability. But the lady's equivocation is quite of a piece
with Memering's oath in 'Ravengaard and Memering,' Grundtvig, No
13, and King Dietrich's in the Dietrichsaga, linger, c. 222, p.
206.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_051','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>English <b>A</b> and all the Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian
ballads employ the stratagem of lulling the man to sleep, but
these are not the only ballads in which the man lays his head in
the woman's lap. This trait is observed in nearly all German
ballads of the second and third class, in <i>all</i> the well-preserved
ones, and also in the Magyar ballad. With regard to the German
ballads, however, it is purposeless (for it does not advance the
action of the drama in the least), and must be regarded as a
relic of an earlier form.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_052','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> English <b>B</b>-<b>F</b> and all
the French ballads dispose of the traitor by a watery death. The
scene is shifted from a wood to a sea-coast pool, or river bank,
perhaps to suit the locality to which the ballad had wandered. In
English <b>B</b>, where, apparently under the influence of other
ballads,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_053','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> the lady is forced to wade into water up to her
chin, the knight is pushed off his horse when bending over to
give a last kiss for which he had been asked; in English
<b>C</b>-<b>F</b> and French <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, the man is
induced to turn his face to save the woman's modesty; in French
<b>C</b>-<b>E</b> he is made to pull off her stockings or shoes,
and then, while off his guard, pitched into a sea or river. This
expedient is sufficiently trivial; but still more so, and grazing
on the farcical, is that which is made use of in the Dutch ballad
and those of the German first class, the woman's persuading the
man to take off his fine coat lest it should be spattered with
her blood, and cutting off his head with his own sword while he
is thus occupied. The Spanish and Portuguese ballads make the
lady borrow the knight's knife to remove some of the trimming of
her dress, and in the Italian she borrows his sword to cut a
bough to shade her horse; for in Italian the halt in the wood is
completely forgotten, and the last half of the action takes place
on horseback. All these contrivances plainly have less claim to
be regarded as primary than that of binding the murderer after he
has been put to sleep.</p>

<p>The knight in English <b>A</b> is called an Elf, and as such
is furnished with an enchanting horn, which is replaced by a harp
of similar properties in <b>B</b>, where, however, the male personage
has neither name nor any kind of designation. The elf-horn of
English <b>A</b> is again represented by the seductive song of
the Dutch ballad and of German <b>G</b>-<b>R</b> and <b>Z</b>.
Though the lady is not lured away in the Scandinavian ballads by
irresistible music,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_054','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, Norwegian
<b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, and Swedish <b>D</b> present to her the
prospect of being taken to an elf-land, or elysium, and there are
traces of this in Danish <b>G</b> and <b>D</b> also, and in
Polish <b>Q</b>. The tongue that talks after the head is off, in
the Dutch ballad and in German <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>, is another mark of an unearthly being. Halewyn, Ulver,
Gert Olbert, like the English knight, are clearly supernatural,
though of a nondescript type. The elf in English <b>A</b> is not
to be interpreted too strictly, for the specific elf is not of a
sanguinary turn, as these so conspicuously are. He is
comparatively innocuous, like the hill-man Young Akin, in another
English ballad, who likewise entices away a woman by magical
music, but only to make her his wife. But the elf-knight and the
rest seem to delight in bloodshed for its own sake; for, as
Grundtvig has pointed out, there is no other apparent motive for
murder in English <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, the Norwegian ballads,
Danish <b>A</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, or German
<a name="Page_I_50"/>
<b>A</b>-<b>E</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_055','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This is true again, for one reason or
another, of others of the German ballads, of the French, of most
of the Italian, and of the Hungarian ballads.</p>

<p>The nearest approach to the Elf-knight, Halewyn, etc., is
perhaps Quintalin, in the saga of Samson the Fair. He was son of
the miller Galin. Nobody knew who his mother was, but many were
of the mind that Galin might have had him of a "goddess," an elf
or troll woman, who lived under the mill force. He was a thief,
and lay in the woods; was versed in many knave's tricks, and had
also acquired agreeable arts. He was a great master of the harp,
and would decoy women into the woods with his playing, keep them
as long as he liked, and send them home pregnant to their fathers
or husbands. A king's daughter, Valentina, is drawn on by his
music deep into the woods, but is rescued by a friendly power.
Some parts of her dress and ornaments, which she had laid off in
her rapid following up of the harping, are afterwards found, with
a great quantity of precious things, in the subaqueous cave of
Quintalin's mother, who is a complete counterpart to Grendel's,
and was probably borrowed from Be&oacute;wulf.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_056','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This
demi-elf Quintalin is a tame personage by the side of Grendel or
of Halewyn. Halewyn does not devour his victims, like Grendel:
Quintalin does not even murder his. He allures women with his
music to make them serve his lust. We may infer that he would
plunder them, for he is a notorious thief. Even two of the oldest
Danish ballads, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and again Danish <b>I</b> and
Swedish <b>C</b>, make the treacherous knight as lecherous as
bloody, and so with German <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>,
<b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>, and Italian
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>. This trait is
wanting in Danish <b>D</b>, where, though traces of the
originally demonic nature of the knight remain, the muckle gold
of the maids already appears as the motive for the murders. In
the later Danish <b>E</b>-<b>H</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, and
Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, the original elf or demon has sunk to
a remorseless robber, generally with brothers, sisters, or
underlings for accomplices.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_056','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This is pre&euml;minently his
character in English <b>C</b>-<b>F</b>, in nearly all the forty
Polish ballads, and in the two principal ballads of the German
second class, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, though English <b>D</b>, German
<b>H</b>, and Polish <b>Q</b> retain a trace of the supernatural:
the first in the charm by means of which the knight compels the
maid to quit her parents, the second in the bloody spring, and
the last in the golden mountains. There is nothing that
unequivocally marks the robber in the other German ballads of the
second class and in those of the third. The question 'Weinst du
um deines Vaters Gut?' in <b>I</b>-<b>L</b>, <b>O</b>-<b>S</b>,
<b>T</b>-<b>W</b>, is hardly decisive, and only in <b>W</b> and
<b>Z</b> is it expressly said that the maid had taken valuable
things with her (as in Swedish <b>D</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, English <b>D</b>-<b>F</b>). <b>J</b>-<b>L</b>,
<b>O</b>-<b>S</b>, give us to understand that the lady had lost

<p>The woman in these ballads is for the most part nameless, or
bears a stock name to which no importance can be attached. Not so
with the names of the knight. Most of these are
<a name="Page_I_51"/>
peculiar, and the
Northern ones, though superficially of some variety, have yet
likeness enough to tempt one to seek for a common original.
Grundtvig, with considerable diffidence, suggests Oldemor as a
possible ground-form. He conceives that the R of some of the
Scandinavian names may be a relic of a foregoing Herr. The
initial H would easily come or go. Given such a name as Hollemen
(Danish <b>C</b>), we might expect it to give place to Halewyn,
which is both a family and a local name in Flanders, if the
ballad should pass into the Low Countries from Denmark, a
derivation that Grundtvig is far from asserting. So Ulinger, a
local appellation, might be substituted for the Ulver of Danish
<b>A</b>. Grundtvig, it must be borne in mind, declines to be
responsible for the historical correctness of this genealogy, and
would be still less willing to undertake an explanation of the
name Oldemor.</p>

<p>In place of Oldemor, Professor Sophus Bugge, in a recent
article, marked by his characteristic sharp-sightedness and
ingenuity, has proposed Hollevern, Holevern, or Olevern as the
base-form of all the Northern names for the bloody knight, and he
finds in this name a main support for the entirely novel and
somewhat startling hypothesis that the ballad we are dealing with
is a wild shoot from the story of Judith and Holofernes.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_060','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
His argument, given as briefly as possible, is as follows.</p>

<p>That the Bible story was generally known in the Middle Ages no
one would question. It was treated in a literary way by an
Anglo-Saxon poet, who was acquainted with the scriptural
narrative, and in a popular way by poets who had no direct
acquaintance with the original.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_061','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The source of the story in the
ballad must in any case be a tradition many times removed from
the biblical story; that much should be changed, much dropped,
and much added is only what would be expected.</p>

<p>Beginning the comparison with 'Judith' with this caution, it
is first submitted that Holofernes can be recognized in most of
the Scandinavian and German names of the knight. The v of the
proposed base-form is preserved in Ulver, Halewyn, and probably
in the English Elf-knight. It is easy to explain a v's passing
over to g, as in Ulinger, Adelger, and especially under the
influence of the very common names in -ger. Again, v might easily
become b, as in Olbert, or m, as in Hollemen, Olmor; and the
initial R of Rulleman, Romor, etc., may have been carried over
from a prefixed Herr.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_062','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The original name of the heroine has been lost, and yet it is
to be noticed that Gert Olbert's mother, in German <b>A</b>, is called
Fru Jutte.</p>

<p>The heroine in this same ballad is named Helena (Linnich in
<b>F</b>); in others (German <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>),
Odilia. These are names of saints, and this circumstance may tend
to show that the woman in the ballad was originally conceived of
as rather a saint than a secular character, though in the course
of time the story has so changed that the devout widow who sought
out her country's enemy in his own camp has been transformed into
a young maid who is enticed from home by a treacherous suitor.</p>

<p>It is an original trait in the ballad that the murderer, as is
expressly said in many copies, is from a foreign land. According
to an English version (<b>E</b>), he comes from the north, as
Holofernes does, "venit Assur ex montibus ab aquilone" (Jud. xvi,
5).</p>

<p>The germ of this outlandish knight's blood-thirstiness
<a name="Page_I_52"/>
is
found in the truculent part that Holofernes plays in the Bible,
his threats and devastations. That the false suitor appears
without companions is in keeping with the ballad style of
representation; yet we might find suggestions of the Assyrian's
army in the swains, the brothers, the stable-boy, whom the maid
falls in with on her way home.</p>

<p>The splendid promises made in many of the ballads might have
been developed from the passage where Holofernes, whose bed is
described as wrought with purple, gold, and precious stones, says
to Judith, Thou shalt be great in the house of Nebuchadnezzar,
and thy name shall be named in all the earth (xi, 21).</p>

<p>In many forms of the ballad, especially the Dutch and the
German, the maid adorns her self splendidly, as Judith does: she
even wears some sort of crown in Dutch <b>A</b> 16, German <b>D</b> 8, as
Judith does in x, 3, xvi, 10 (mitram).</p>

<p>In the English <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, the oldest
Danish, <b>A</b>, and the Polish versions, the maid, like Judith,
leaves her home in the night.</p>

<p>The Piedmontese cast&eacute;, Italian <b>E</b> 1 [there is a
castle in nearly all the Italian ballads, and also in Dutch <b>B</b>],
may remind us of Holefernes' castra.</p>

<p>The knight's carrying off the maid, lifting her on to his
horse in many copies, may well come from a misunderstanding of
elevaverunt in Judith x, 20: Et cum in faciem ejus intendisset,
adoravit eum, prosternens se super terram. Et elevaverunt eam
servi Holofernis, jubente domino suo.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_063','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>In German <b>A</b> Gert Olbert and Helena are said to ride
three days and nights, and in Danish <b>D</b> the ride is for
three days; and we may remember that Judith killed Holofernes the
fourth day after her arrival in his camp.</p>

<p>The place in which the pair alight is, according to German <b>G</b>
20, a deep dale, and this agrees with the site of Holofernes'
camp in the valley of Bethulia. There is a spring or stream in
many of the ballads, and also a spring in the camp, in which
Judith bathes (xii, 7).</p>

<p>Most forms of the ballad make the knight, after the halt,
inform the maid that she is to die, as many maids have before her
in the same place; e.g., German <b>G</b> 7:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp; </td>
<td valign="top" align="left">'Der Ulinger hat eylff Jungfrawen gehangen,<br/>

</tr>

</table>

<p>This corresponds with the passage in Judith's song (xvi, 6),
Dixit se ... infantes meos dare in pr&aelig;dam et virgenes
in captivitatem: but it is reasonable to suppose that the ballad
follows some version of the Bible words that varied much from the
original. The incident of the maid's lousing and tousing her
betrayer's hair, while he lies with his head in her lap, may have
come from Judith seizing Holofernes by the hair before she kills
him, but the story of Samson and Delilah may have had influence
here.</p>

<p>According to many German versions, the murderer grants the
maid three cries before she dies. She invokes Jesus, Mary, and
her brother. Or she utters three sighs, the first to God the
Father, the second to Jesus, the third to her brother. These
cries or sighs seem to take the place of Judith's prayer,
Confirma me, Domine Deus Israel (xiii, 7), and it may also be
well to remember that Holofernes granted Judith, on her request,
permission to go out in the night to pray.</p>

<p>The Dutch, Low-German, Scandinavian, and other versions agree
in making the woman kill the knight with his own sword, as in
Judith. The Dutch and Low-German [also Danish <b>F</b>, Swedish
<b>A</b>] have preserved an original trait in making the maid hew
off the murderer's head. English and French versions dispose of
the knight differently: the maid pushes him into sea or river.
Perhaps, in some older form of the story, after the head was cut
off, the trunk was pushed into the water: cf. Judith xiii, 10:
Abscidit caput ejus et ... evolvit corpus ejus truncum. The words
apprehendit comam capitis ejus (xiii, 9) have their
<a name="Page_I_53"/>
parallel in
Dutch <b>A</b>, 33: "Zy nam bet hoofd al by het haer." The Dutch
ballad makes the maid carry the head with her.</p>

<p>"Singing and ringing" she rode through the wood: Judith sings
a song of praise to the Lord after her return home.</p>

<p>In English <b>C</b>-<b>F</b>, May Colven comes home before
dawn, as Judith does. The Dutch <b>A</b> says, When to her
father's gate she came, she blew the horn like a man. Compare
Judith xiii, 13: Et dixit Judith a longe custodibus murorum,
Aperite portas!</p>

<p>The Dutch text goes on to say that when the father heard the
horn he was delighted at his daughter's return: and Judith v, 14,
Et factum est, cum audissent viri vocem ejus, vocaverunt
presbyteros civitatis.</p>

<p>The conclusion of Dutch <b>A</b> is that there was a banquet held,
and the head was set on the table. 'So Judith causes Holofernes'
head to be hung up on the city wall, and after the enemy have
been driven off, the Jews hold a feast.</p>

<p>The Icelandic version, though elsewhere much mutilated, has a
concluding stanza which certainly belongs to the ballad:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp; </td>
<td valign="top" align="left">&Aacute;sa went into a holy cell,<br/>
Never did she harm to man.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>This agrees with the view taken of the heroine of the ballad
as a saint, and with the Bible account that Judith lived a chaste
widow after her husband's demise.</p>

<p>Danish <b>D</b> is unique in one point. The robber has shown
the maid a little knoll, in which the "much gold" of the women he
has murdered lies. When she has killed him, the maid says,
"<i>I</i> shall have the much gold," and takes as much as she can carry
off. Compare with this Holofernes putting Judith into his
treasury (xii, 1),<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_065','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> her carrying off the conop&oelig;um (xiii, 10),
and her receiving from the people all Holofernes' gold, silver,
clothes, jewels, and furniture, as her share of the plunder of
the Assyrian camp (xv, 14). It is, perhaps, a perversion of this
circumstance that the robber in German <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, is
refused per mission to keep his costly clothes.</p>

<p>English <b>D</b> seems also to have preserved a portion of
the primitive story, when it makes the maid tell her parents in
the morning all that has happened, whereupon they go with her to
the sea-shore to find the robber's body. The foundation for this
is surely the Bible account that Judith makes known her act to
the elders of the city, and that the Jews go out in the morning
and fall on the enemv's camp, in which Holofernes' body is lying.
In Swedish <b>C</b> the robber's sisters mourn over his body, and in
Judith xiv, 18 the Assyrians break out into loud cries when they
learn of Holofernes' death.</p>

<p>In all this it is simply contended that the story of Judith is
the remote source of the ballad, and it is conceded that many of
the correspondences which have been cited may be accidental.
Neither the Latin text of Judith nor any other written treatment
of the story of Judith is supposed to have been known to the
author of the ballad. The knowledge of its biblical origin being
lost, the story would develop itself in its own way, according to
the fashion of oral tradition. And so the pious widow into whose
hands God gave over his enemies is converted into a fair maid who
is enticed by a false knight into a wood, and who kills him in
defence of her own life.</p>

<p>A similar transformation can be shown elsewhere in popular
poetry. The little Katie of certain northern ballads (see
Grundtvig, No 101) is a maid among other maids who prefers death
to dishonor; but was originally Saint Catherine, daughter of the
king of Egypt, who suffered martyrdom for the faith under the
Emperor Maxentius. All the versions of the Halewyn ballad which
we possess, even the purest, may be far removed from the
primitive, both as to story and as to metrical form. New features
would be taken up, and old ones would disappear. One copy has
<a name="Page_I_54"/>
preserved genuine particulars, which another has lost, but Dutch
tradition has kept the capital features best of all.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_066','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Professor Bugge's argument has been given with an approach to
fulness out of a desire to do entire justice to the distinguished
author's case, though most of the correspondences adduced by him
fail to produce any effect upon my mind.</p>

<p>The case is materially strengthened by the Dutch text <b>C</b>
(' Roland'), which was not accessible at the time Bugge's paper
was written. The name Roland is not so close to Holofern as
Halewyn, but is still within the range of conceivable
metamorphosis. The points of coincidence between Dutch <b>C</b>
and the story of Judith are these: The woman, first making an
elaborate toilet,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_067','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> goes out to seek the man, who is spoken
of as surrounded with soldiers; she is challenged on the way;
finds Roland lying on his bed, which he proposes she shall share
(or lose her life);<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_068','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> she cuts off his head, which, after her
return home, she exposes from her window.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_069','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>If this was the original form of the Dutch ballad, and the
Dutch ballad is the source from which all the other ballads have
come, by processes of dropping, taking up, and transforming, then
we may feel compelled to admit that this ballad might be a wild
shoot from the story of Judith. Any one who bears in inind the
strange changes which stories undergo will hesitate to pronounce
this impossible. What poor Ophelia says of us human creatures is
even truer of ballads: "We know what we are, but know not what we
may be."</p>

<p>But when we consider how much would have to be dropped, how
much to be taken up, and how much to be transformed, before the
Hebrew "gest" could be converted into the European ballad, we
naturally look for a less difficult hypothesis. It is a
supposition at tended with less difficulty that an independent
European tradition existed of a half-human, half-demonic being,
who possessed an irresistible power of decoying away young maids,
and was wont to kill them after he got them into his hands, but
who at last found one who was more than his match, and lost his
own life through her craft and courage. A modification of this
story is afforded by the large class of Bluebeard tales. The
Quintalin story seems to be another variety, with a substitution
of lust for bloodthirst. The Dutch ballad may have been <i>affected</i>
by some lost ballad of Holofern, and may have taken up some of
its features, at least that of carrying home Halewyn's
[Roland's] head, which is found in no other version.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d004_070','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
