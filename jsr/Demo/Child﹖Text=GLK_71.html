<h3>71. The Bent Sae Brown</h3>

<p>'The Bent sae Brown' combines the story of 'Clerk Saunders'
(No. 69) with that of another ballad, not found in an independent
form in English, but. sufficiently common in Danish and Swedish
(Kristensen, No. 80, etc.); whence the non-tragical conclusion,
for the killing of a certain number of brothers is not regarded
as a very serious matter by the heroine, whether in English or
Norse. The introduction and conclusion, and some incidental
decorations, of the Scottish ballad will not be found in the
Norse, but are an outcome of the invention and the piecing and
shaping of that humble but enterprising rhapsodist who has left
his trail over so large a part of Buchan's volumes.</p>

<p>Stanzas 21-34 contain the substance of the Norse ballad
referred to. A youth has passed the night with his love, either
in her bower or in a wood. When they are about to part in the
morning, she begs him to be on his guard against her seven
brothers, on his way through the wood and over the heath. He
makes light of the danger, and in the wood meets the seven
brothers. They demand how he comes to be there, and he feigns to
have been out with his hawk and hounds. No, they say, you were
with our sister last night. He makes no denial. They ask whether
he will fly or fight. He has no thought of flight, kills all
seven, and goes back to his love. She will not forsake him for
killing her brothers; nor would she, in some versions, had he
killed her father too.</p>
