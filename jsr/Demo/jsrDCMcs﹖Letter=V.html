plus/minus offset from Coordinated Universal Time. A component
that is omitted from the string is termed a null component.
Trailing null components of Date Time are ignored. Non-trailing
null components are prohibited, given that the optional suffix is
not considered as a component.<br/>
<b>Note</b>:<br/>
For reasons of backward
compatibility with versions of this standard prior to V3.0, many
existing DICOM Data Elements use the separate DA and TM VRs.
Standard and Private Data Elements defined in the future should
use DT, when appropriate, to be more compliant with ANSI HISPP
MSDS.<br/>
Character Set: &quot;0&quot;-&quot;9&quot;, &quot;+&quot;,
&quot;-&quot;, &quot;.&quot; of Default Character Repertoire<br/>

<h3>VR is LO</h3>
<p>Value Representation "Long String"<br/>
A character string that may be padded withleading
and/or trailing spaces. The character code 5CH (the BACKSLASH
&quot;\&quot; in ISO-IR 6) shall not be present, as it is used as
the delimiter between values in multiple valued data elements.
The string shall not have Control Characters except for ESC.<br/>

A character string that may contain one or more
paragraphs. It may contain the Graphic Character set and the
Control Characters, CR, LF, FF, and ESC. It may be padded with
trailing spaces, which may be ignored, but leading spaces are
considered to be significant. Data Elements with this VR shall
not be multi-valued and therefore character code 5CH (the
BACKSLASH &quot;\&quot; in ISO-IR 6) may be used.<br/>
Character Set: Default Character Repertoire and/or as defined by
(0008,0005).<br/>
Size Restriction(s): 10240 chars maximum (see NOTE in 6.2)</p><a href="jsrDCMcs%EF%B9%96Term=.html"></a>
<h3>VR is OB</h3>
<p>Value Representation "Other Byte String"<br/>
A string of bytes where the encoding of the
contents is specified by the negotiated Transfer Syntax. OB is a
VR which is insensitive to Little/Big Endian byte ordering (see
Section 7.3). The string of bytes shall be padded with a single
trailing NULL byte value (00H) when necessary to achieve even
length.<br/>

<h3>VR is OW</h3>
<p>Value Representation "Other Word String"<br/>
A string of 16-bit words where the encoding of the
contents is specified by the negotiated Transfer Syntax. OW is a
VR which requires byte swapping within each word when changing
between Little Endian and Big Endian byte ordering (see Section
7.3).<br/>
Character Set: not applicable<br/>
Size Restriction(s): see Transfer Syntax definition</p><a href="jsrDCMcs%EF%B9%96Term=.html"></a>
<h3>VR is PN</h3>
<p>Value Representation "Person Name"<br/>
A character string encoded using a 5 component
convention. The character code 5CH (the BACKSLASH &quot;\&quot;
in ISO-IR 6) shall not be present, as it is used as the delimiter
between values in multiple valued data elements. The string may
be padded with trailing spaces. The five components in their
order of occurrence are: family name complex, given name complex,
middle name, name prefix, name suffix. Any of the five components
may be an empty string. The component delimiter shall be the
caret &quot;^&quot; character (5EH). Delimiters are required for
interior null components. Trailing null components and their
delimiters may be omitted. Multiple entries are permitted in each
component and are encoded as natural text strings, in the format
preferred by the named person. This conforms to the ANSI HISPP
MSDS Person Name common data type.<br/>
This group of five components
is referred to as a Person Name component group.<br/>
For the purpose
of writing names in ideographic characters and in phonetic
characters, up to 3 groups of components (see Annex H examples 1
and 2) may be used. The delimiter for component groups shall be
the equals character &quot;=&quot; (3DH). The three component
groups of components in their order of occurrence are: a
single-byte character representation, an ideographic
representation, and a phonetic representation.<br/>
Any component
group may be absent, including the first component group. In this
case, the person name may start with one or more &quot;=&quot;
delimiters. Delimiters are required for interior null component
groups. Trailing null component groups and their delimiters may be
omitted.<br/>
Precise semantics are defined for each component group.
See section 6.2.1.<br/>
<b>Examples</b>:<br/>
Rev. John Robert Quincy Adams, B.A. M.Div.<br/>
&quot;Adams^John Robert Quincy^^Rev.^B.A. M.Div.&quot;<br/>
[One family name; three given names; no middle name; one prefix;
two suffixes.]<br/>
Susan Morrison-Jones, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer<br/>
&quot;Morrison-Jones^Susan^^^Ph.D., Chief Executive
Officer&quot;<br/>
[Two family names; one given name; no middle name;
no prefix; two suffixes.]<br/>
John Doe<br/>
&quot;Doe^John&quot;<br/>
[One family name; one given name; no middle name, prefix, or suffix.
Delimiters have been omitted for the three trailing null
components.]<br/>
(For examples of the encoding of Person Names using
multi-byte character sets see Annex H)<br/>
<b>Notes</b><br/>
1. This five
component convention is also used by HL7 as defined in ASTM
E-1238-91 and further specialized by the ANSI MSDS.<br/>
2. In typical
American and European usage the first occurrence of &quot;given
name&quot; would represent the &quot;first name&quot;. The second
and subsequent occurrences of the &quot;given name&quot; would
typically be treated as a middle name(s). The &quot;middle
name&quot; component is retained for the purpose of backward
compatibility with existing standards.<br/>
3. The &quot;Degree&quot;
component present in ASTM E-1238-91 is absorbed into the
&quot;Suffix&quot; component.<br/>
4. The implementor should remain
mindful of earlier usage forms which represented &quot;given
names&quot; as &quot;first&quot; and &quot;middle&quot; and that
translations to and from this previous typical usage may be
required.<br/>
5. For reasons of backward compatibility with versions
of this standard prior to V3.0, person names might be considered
a single family name complex (single component without
&quot;^&quot; delimiters).<br/>
Character Set: Default Character Repertoire and/or as defined by
(0008,0005) excluding Control Characters LF, FF, and CR but

<p>Value Representation "Short String"<br/>
A character string that may be padded with leading
and/or trailing spaces. The character code 05CH (the BACKSLASH
&quot;\&quot; in ISO-IR 6) shall not be present, as it is used as
the delimiter between values for multiple data elements. The
string shall not have Control Characters except ESC.<br/>
Character Set: Default Character Repertoire and/or as defined by
(0008,0005).<br/>

Character Set: not applicable<br/>
Size Restriction(s): 2 bytes fixed</p><a href="jsrDCMcs%EF%B9%96Term=.html"></a>
<h3>VR is ST</h3>
<p>Value Representation "Short Text"<br/>
A character string that may contain one or more
paragraphs. It may contain the Graphic Character set and the
Control Characters, CR, LF, FF, and ESC. It may be padded with
trailing spaces, which may be ignored, but leading spaces are
considered to be significant. Data Elements with this VR shall
not be multi-valued and therefore character code 5CH (the
BACKSLASH &quot;\&quot; in ISO-IR 6) may be used.<br/>
Character Set: Default Character Repertoire and/or as defined by
(0008,0005).<br/>

frac contains a fractional part of a second as small as 1
millionth of a second (range &quot;000000&quot; -
&quot;999999&quot;). A 24 hour clock is assumed. Midnight can be
represented by only &quot;0000&quot; since &quot;2400&quot; would
violate the hour range. The string may be padded with trailing
spaces. Leading and embedded spaces are not allowed. One or more
of the components mm, ss, or frac may be unspecified as long as
every component to the right of an unspecified component is also
unspecified. If frac is unspecified the preceding &quot;.&quot;
may not be included. Frac shall be held to six decimal places or
less to ensure its format conforms to the ANSI HISPP MSDS Time
common data type.<br/>
<b>Examples</b>:<br/>
1. &quot;070907.0705 &quot;
represents a time of 7 hours, 9 minutes and 7.0705 seconds.<br/>
2. &quot;1010&quot; represents a time of 10 hours, and 10 minutes.<br/>
3. &quot;021 &quot; is an invalid value.<br/>
<b>Notes</b><br/>
1. For reasons of
backward compatibility with versions of this standard prior to
V3.0, it is recommended that implementations also support a
string of characters of the format hh:mm:ss.frac for this VR.<br/>
