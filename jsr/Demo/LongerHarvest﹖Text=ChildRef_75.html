<p><b>I</b> is made up of portions of several ballads. The first
stanza is derived from '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_77.html">Sweet William's Ghost</a>,' the second and
third possibly from some form of 'Death and the Lady,' 4-11 from
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_65.html">Lady Maisry</a>.' The eighth stanza of <b>E</b> should, perhaps, be
considered as taken from '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_73.html">Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</a>,' since in
no other copy of 'Lord Lovel' and in none of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_74.html">Fair Margaret and Sweet William</a>
' does the hero die by his own hand.</p>

<p>In '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_74.html">Fair Margaret and Sweet William</a>,' as also in
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_73.html">Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</a>,' a lover sacrifices his
inclination to make a
marriage of interest. In 'Lord Lovel' the woman dies, not of
affection betrayed, but of hope too long deferred, and her
laggard but not unfaithful lover sinks under his remorse and
grief. 'Lord Lovel ' is peculiarly such a ballad as Orsino likes
and praises: it is silly sooth, like the old age. Therefore a
gross taste has taken pleasure in parodying it, and the same with
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_53.html">Young Beichan</a>.' But there are people in this world who are
amused even with a burlesque of Othello.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d075_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>There are several sets of ballads, very common in Germany and
in Scandinavia, which, whether they are or are not variations of
the same original, at least have a great deal in common with
'Lord Lovel' and '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_74.html">Fair Margaret and Sweet William</a>.'</p>

<p>Of these, one which more closely resembles the English is 'Der
Ritter und die Maid,' of German origin, but found also further
north.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d075_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A knight and maid have been together till morning. She weeps;
he tells her that he will pay for her honor, will give her an
underling and money. She will have none but him, and will go home
to her mother. The mother, on seeing her, asks why her gown is
long behind and short before, and offers her meat and drink. The
daughter refuses them, goes to bed, and dies. So far there is no
dallying with the innocence of love, as in the English ballad;
the German knight is simply a brutal man of pleasure. But now the
knight has a dream, as in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_74.html">Fair Margaret and Sweet William</a>;' it
is that his love has died. He bids his squire or groom to saddle,
and rides to find out what has happened. On his way he hears an
ominous bell; further on he sees a grave digging; then he meets
men carrying a bier. Set down the bier, he cries, that I may see
my love. He turns back the cloth and looks at the dead. She has
suffered for him, he will suffer for her. He draws his sword and
runs it through his heart. They are buried in one coffin, or in
the same grave. In some of the ballads lilies rise from the
grave; in a Swedish version ('Jungfruns d&ouml;d '), a linden,
the leaves of which intermingle.</p>

<p>Next to this we may put a Norwegian and a Swedish ballad,
which, having perhaps lost something at the beginning, cannot
safely be classed: 'Maarst&iacute;g aa hass m&ouml;y,' Bugge, p.
127, No 26, A, B; 'Herr Malmstens dr&ouml;m,' Afzelius, III, 104,
No 85. Maarst&iacute;g dreams that his love's gold ring has got
upon another finger, that her gold belt is off her lithe waist,
her cloak or her hair is cut to bits, her shoes are full of
blood; Malmsten that his love's heart breaks. The pages are
ordered to saddle, and Maarst&iacute;g, or Malmsten, fides to
find what there is in the dream. Maarst&iacute;g encounters two
maids, who are just from a wake. "Who is dead?" "Maalfr&iacute;,
thy sweet love." He rides on, meets the bier, bids the bearers
set it down, and looks at the dead. Let them dig the grave, he
cries, wide and deep, it shall be his bride-house; let them dig
the grave deep and long, that is where bride and bridegroom shall
go. He sets his sword against a stone, and falls on it. With
slight variations, the course of the story is the same for
Malmsten. Another Swedish ballad, 'Den s&ouml;rjande,' Djurklou,
p. 106, No 7, lacks even so much introduction as the dream. The
lover orders his horse, hears the funeral bell, sees the
grave-digging, meets the bier, looks at his dead mistress, and
kills himself. A fragment in Dybeck's Runa, 1845, p. 15, begins
with the ride and stops short of the death.</p>

<p>These last ballads apparently give us the middle and end of a
story which has also some sort of beginning in the following:
Danish, 'Den elskedes D&oslash;d,' Kristensen, II, 39, No 20,
A-D, and in many unprinted copies from oral tradition, besides
two from Manuscripts of the sixteenth century, communicated to me
by Grundtvig; Swedish, 'Hertig Nils,' Arwidsson, II, 21, No 72,
'Peder Palleson,' Arwidsson, No 71, II, 18, 437; Norwegian, 'Herr
Stragi,' Landstad, p. 537, No 61.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d075_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A lover and his mistress
have parted, have been long parted. She is sick, dying, or even
dead. In the Danish manuscript copies we are distinctly told that
she has grieved herself to death on his account. Word is sent him
by carrier-pigeons, a bird, a page; or he is informed by a
spae-wife (Landstad). He leaps over the table, spilling mead and
wine (Kristensen), and rides faster than the doves fly. The rest
of the tale is much as before, with those minor diversities that
are to be expected. The lover commonly kills himself, but dies of
heart-break in 'Peder Palleson' and one of the sixteenth century
Danish copies. In the latter he hears the bells, says he shall
never arrive alive, dies without the house and she within; in the
former the maid dies in the upper room, the swain on the wild
moor. In the Danish manuscript copies the man is laid south in
the churchyard, the maid north [west, east], two roses spring
from their breasts and span the church-roof, and there they shall
stay till doom; in Kristensen it is two lilies, in Arwidsson a
linden.</p>

<p>With these last may belong a German ballad of a young
Markgraf, who marries a very young wife, goes for her mother upon
the approach of a threatening childbirth, and, returning, has
encounters similar to those in 'Der Ritter und die Maid.' In some
instances it is a Reiter, or Jager, "wohlgemuth," not married, or
in secret relations with his love, who, coming to a wood or
heath, hears a bell that alarms him; etc. In the end he generally
kills himself, sometimes dies of a broken heart. Lilies in
several cases rise from the young woman's grave, or their
grave.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d075_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A Romaic ballad has the characteristic features of the
English, German, and Scandinavian stories, with a beginning of
its own, as these also have: '&#919;
&#917;&#8016;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#945;,' '&#927;
&#935;&#8049;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#7984; &#7969;
&#922;&#8057;&#961;&#951;,' etc. (1) Zambelios, p. 715, 2 =
Passow, No 415; (2) Passow, No 418; (3) Fauriel, p. 112, No 6 =
Passow, No 417; (4) Marcellus, II, 72 = Passow, No 414; (5)
Chasiotis, p. 169, No 5; (6) Passow, No 416; (7) Arabantinos, p.
285, No 472; (8) Tommaseo, III, 307 f; (9) Jeannaraki, p. 239, No
301; and no doubt elsewhere, for the ballad is a favorite. A
young girl, who has nine brothers and is betrothed (or perhaps
newly married) to a rich pallikar, professes not to fear Death.
Death immediately shows his power over her. Her lover, coming
with a splendid train to celebrate his nuptials, sees a cross on
her mother's gate, a sign that some one has died. In (2) he lifts
a gold handkerchief from the face of the dead, and sees that it
is his beloved. Or he finds a man digging a grave, and asks for
whom the grave is, and is told. "Make the grave deep and broad,"
he cries; "make it for two," and stabs himself with his dagger. A
clump of reeds springs from one of the lovers, a cypress
[lemon-tree] from the other, which bend one towards the other and
kiss whenever a strong breeze blows.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d075_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>In a Catalan ballad, a young man hears funeral bells, asks for
whom they ring, is told that it is for his love, rides to her
house, finds the balcony hung with black, kneels at the feet of
the dead, and uncovers her face. She speaks and tells him where
his gifts to her may be found, then bids him order the carpenter
to make a coffin large enough for two. He draws his dagger and
stabs himself; there are two dead in one house! 'La mort de la
Nuvia,' Briz y Candi, I, 135, Mil&aacute;, Romancerillo, p. 321
f, No 337 A<sub>11</sub>, B<sub>11</sub>; found also in
Majorca.</p>

<p>As will readily be supposed, some of the incidents of this
series of ballads are found in traditional song in various
connections.</p>
