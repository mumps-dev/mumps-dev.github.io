<p><b>A</b> <b>a</b> in Ritson's Robin Hood, 1795, II, 146,
"compared with the York copy," that is, with two or three slight
changes: Evans, Old Ballads, 1777, 1784, I, 211. B, the Scottish
copy, is very likely only an imperfect remembrance of a
broadside, but the date of the Manuscript, though this is perhaps
not determinable, has been put as early as 1730.</p>

<p>Robin Hood, expecting the Bishop of Hereford to pass near
Barnsdale, has a deer killed for his dinner. He dresses himself
and six of his men in shepherd's attire, and when the Bishop
approaches they make an ado to attract his attention. The Bishop
interrogates them. Robin owns that they mean to make merry with
the king's venison. The Bishop will show them no mercy; they must
go before the king with him. Robin summons his band with his horn
and it is the Bishop's turn to cry mercy. Robin will not let him
off, but takes him to Barnsdale, and makes him great cheer. The
Bishop foresees that there will be a heavy reckoning. Little John
searches the Bishop's portmanteau, and takes out three hundred
pound; enough, he says, to make him in charity with the
churchman. They make the Bishop dance in his boots, <b>A</b>, or
sing a mass, <b>B</b>, and he is glad to get off so lightly.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Hereford appears in the next ballad, Robin Hood
and Queen Katherine. He there tells us that Robin had made him
sing a mass out of hours, and had borrowed money of him against
his will.</p>

<p>The conclusion of this ballad is to the same effect as that of
the preceding, and was probably suggested by the Gest. No copy
has been found, in print or writing, earlier than the last
century; a fact of no special importance. Whenever written, if
written it was, it is far superior to most of the seventeenth
century broadsides. Mr. Chappell speaks of; it as being now
(thirty years ago) the most popular of the Robin Hood set.</p>
