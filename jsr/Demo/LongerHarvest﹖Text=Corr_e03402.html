<h3>34. Kemp Owyne</h3>

<p>P. 307 f. Caspar Decurtius, Marchen aus dem B&uuml;ndner
Oberlande, nach dem R&auml;to-Romanischen erz&auml;hlt, Jecklin,
Volksth&uuml;mliches aus Graub&uuml;nden, Z&uuml;rich, 1874, p.
126, has a tale of a Schlangenjungfrau who is a maid by day and a
serpent by night, and is disenchanted by three kisses. G.L.K.</p>

<p>311. The Rev. Robert Lambe sent Percy, under date 
of January 29, 1768, " the best copy of 'The Laidley 
Worm' that he could procure from many incorrect, imperfect, and nonsensical ones." There are differences 
between this and the copy printed in Hutchinson,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_e03402_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> but 
one is about as good as the other. In this earlier copy 
2 follows 3 and 37 is wanting. 6 and 7 read:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>O up then spake the queen herself:<br/>
Who 's this that welcoms me?<br/>
A lord replied, The king's daughter,<br/>
The flower of the North Country.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'Wo be to thee, thou gray-haird man,<br/>
Thou mightst have excepted me;<br/>
Before the morn at this same time<br/>
I'll bring her to low degree.'</td></tr>

</table>

<p>And 17, 22:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>He straightway built a bonny ship,<br/>
And set her on the sea;<br/>
Her sails were made of silk so fine,<br/>
Her masts of rowan-tree.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>The hags came back, finding their charms<br/>
Most powerfully withstood;<br/>
For warlocks, witches, cannot work<br/>
Where there is rowan-tree wood.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Duncan Frasier does not appear in the last stanza:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Now this fact, as it happened, is<br/>
For their good sung in rhime,<br/>
Lest they should some important part<br/>
Forget of it in time.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Along with this earlier copy of Lambe's is found an other,
undescribed, which shows both agreements and variations: 2
follows 3, and 6, 7 and the final stanza are the same. 1 7 and 22
are wanting, and there are, therefore, no witches and no
rowan-tree. Instead of 21-23, we have this very bad stanza:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'Run, run, my men, my sailors send<br/>
Aboard yon ship so tall.<br/>
And bid them drown the Child of Wind;<br/>
But he soon slew them all.'</td></tr>

</table>

<p>In the same parcel there is a copy of 'The Laidley Worm' which
is somewhat more in the popular tone than the one already
printed. It was sent in an undated letter [1775?] to J. Bulman,
Esq., of Sheepwash, Morpeth, by E.G., that is, Captain E. Grow.
"The above," says E.G., "is the Haggworm as I collected it from
an old woman. I wrote to the Revrd Mr. Lamb for his ballad, and
directed him to send to you. ... I think the inclosed more
original then his, for Mr. Lamb, tho a good antiquarian, is but a
bad poet, and above the one half is his own composing." Mr. J.
Bulman appears to have transmitted this version to Percy, to
whom, upon another occasion, May 25, 1775, he sends "a bold
imitation of the song, now lost, of the Laidler Worm (written by
Duncan Frazier, the monk on Cheviot, in 1270), by a lady, Miss
Graham of Gloriorum, in Northumberland;" of which nothing need be
said.</p>

<p>'The Hagg Worm,' obtained from an old woman by Captain E. 
Grow.</p>
