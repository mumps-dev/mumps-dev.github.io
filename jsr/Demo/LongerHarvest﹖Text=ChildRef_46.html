<p>A copy of this ballad was printed in The New British Songster,
a collection of Songs, Scots and English, with Toasts and
Sentiments for the Bottle, Falkirk, 1785: see Motherwell, p.

remarks
<a name="Page_I_415"/>
that 'Captain Wedderburn' was equally in vogue in the
north and the south of Scotland.</p>

<p>Jamieson writes to the Scots Magazine, 1803, p. 701: "Of this
ballad I have got one whole copy and part of another, and I
remember a good deal of it as I have heard it sung in Morayshire
when I was a child." In his Popular Ballads, II, 154, 1806, he
says that the copy which he prints was furnished him from Mr.
Herd's Manuscript by the editor of the Border Minstrelsy, and
that he had himself supplied a few readings of small importance
from his own recollection. There is some inaccuracy here. The
version given by Jamieson is rather <b>B</b>, with readings from
<b>A</b>.</p>

<p>'Captain Wedderburn's Courtship,' or 'Lord Roslin's
Daughter,'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d046_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> is a counterpart of the ballad in which a maid
wins a husband by guessing riddles. (See Nos 1 and 2, and also the
following ballad, for a lady who <i>gives</i>
<a name="Page_I_416"/>
riddles.) The
ingenious suitor, though not so favorite a subject as the clever
maid, may boast that he is of an old and celebrated family. We
find him in the Gesta Romanorum, No 70; Oesterley, p. 383,
Madden's English Versions, No 35, p. 384. A king had a beautiful
daughter, whom he wished to dispose of in marriage; but she had
made a vow that she would accept no husband who had not achieved
three tasks: to tell her how many feet long, broad, and deep were
the four elements; to change the wind from the north; to take
fire into his bosom, next the flesh, without harm. The king
issued a proclamation in accordance with these terms. Many tried
and failed, but at last there came a soldier who succeeded. To
answer the first question he made his servant lie down, and
measured him from head to foot. Every living being is composed of
the four elements, he said, and I find not more than seven feet in
them. A very easy way was hit on for performing the second task:
the soldier simply turned his horse's head to the east, and,
since wind is the life of every animal, maintained that be had
changed the wind. The king was evidently not inclined to be
strict, and said, Clear enough. Let us go on to the third. Then,
by the aid of a stone which he always carried about him, the
soldier put handfuls of burning coals into his bosom without
injury. The king gave his daughter to the soldier.</p>

<p>An extraordinary ballad in Sakellarios's
&#922;&#965;&#960;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#8049;, III, 15, No 6,
'The Hundred Sayings,' subjects a lover to a severe probation of
riddles. (Liebrecht has given a full abstract of the story in
Gosche's Archiv, II, 29.) A youth is madly enamored of a king's
daughter, but, though his devotion knows no bound, cannot for a
long time get a word from her mouth, and then only disdain. She
shuts her self up in a tower. He prays for a heat that may force
her to come to the window, and that she may drop her spindle, and
he be the only one to bring it to her. The heavens are kind: all
this comes to pass, and she is fain to beg him to bring her the
spindle. She asks, Can you do what I say? Shoulder a tower? make
a stack of eggs? trim a date-tree, standing in a great
river?<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d046_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> All this he can do. She sends him away once and again
to learn various things; last of all, the hundred sayings that
lovers use. He presents himself for examination. "One?" "There is
one only God: may he help me!" "Two?" "Two doves with silver
wings are sporting together: I saw how they kissed," etc.
"Three?" "Holy Trinity, help me to love the maid!" "Four?" "There
is a four-pointed cross on thy smock, and it implores God I may
be thy mate:" and so he is catechised through all the units and
tens.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d046_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Then the lady suddenly turns about, concedes
everything, and proposes that they shall go to church: but the
man says, If I am to marry all my loves, I have one in every
town, and wife and children in Constantinople. They part with
reciprocal scurrilities.</p>

<p>Usually when the hand of a princess is to be won by the
performance of tasks, whether requiring wit, courage, the
overcoming of magic arts, or what not, the loss of your head is
the penalty of failure. (See the preface to the following
ballad.) Apollonius of Tyre, of Greek original, but first found
in a Latin form, is perhaps the oldest riddle-story of this
description. Though its age has not been determined, the tale has
been carried back even to the end of the third or the beginning
of the fourth century, was a great favorite with the Middle Ages,
and is kept only too familiar by the play of Pericles.</p>

<a name="Page_I_417"/>
<p>More deserving of perpetuation is the charming Persian story
of Prince Calaf, in P&eacute;tis de La Croix's 1001 Days
(45<sup>e</sup>-82<sup>e</sup> jour), upon which Carlo Gozzi
founded his play of "La Turandot," now best known through
Schiller's translation. Tourandocte's riddles are such as we
should call legitimate, and are three in number. "What is the
being that is found in every land, is dear to all the world, and
cannot endure a fellow?" Calaf answers, The sun. "What mother
swallows the children she has given birth to, as soon as they
have attained their growth?" The sea, says Calaf, for the rivers
that flow into it all came from it. "What is the tree that has
all its leaves white on one side and black on the other?" This
tree, Calaf answers, is the year, which is made up of days and
nights.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d046_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A third example of this hazardous wooing is the story of The
Fair One of the Castle, the fourth in the Persian poem of The
Seven Figures (or Beauties), by Nisami of Gendsch (&#8224; 1180).
A Russian princess is shut up in a castle made inaccessible by a
talisman, and every suitor must satisfy four conditions: he must
be a man of honor, vanquish the enchanted guards, take away the
talisman, and obtain the consent of her father. Many had essayed
their fortune, and their heads were now arrayed on the pinnacles
of the castle.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d046_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A young prince had fulfilled the first three
conditions, but the father would not approve his suit until he
had solved the princess's riddles. These are expressed
symbolically, and answered in the same way. The princess sends
the prince two pearls from her earring: he at once takes her
meaning, &mdash; life is like two drops of water, &mdash; and
returns the pearls with three diamonds, to signify that joy
&mdash; faith, hope, and love &mdash; can prolong life. The
princess now sends him three jewels in a box, with sugar. The
prince seizes the idea, &mdash; life is blended with sensuous
desire, &mdash; and pours milk on the sugar, to intimate that as
milk dissolves sugar, so sensuous desire is quenched by true
love. After four such interchanges,  the princess seals her
consent with a device not less elegant than the others.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d046_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A popular tale of this class is current in Russia, with this
variation: that the hard-hearted princess requires her lovers to
give her riddles, and those who cannot pose her lose their heads.
Foolish Iv&aacute;n, the youngest of three brothers, adventures
after many have failed. On his way to the trial he sees a horse
in a cornfield and drives it out with a whip, and further on
kills a snake with a lance, saying in each case, Here's a riddle!
Confronted with the princess, he says to her, As I came to you, I
saw by the roadside what was good; and in the good was good; so I
set  to work, and with what was good I drove the  good from the
good. The good fled from the  good out of the good. The princess
pleads a headache, and puts off her answer till the next  day,
when Iv&aacute;n gives her his second enigma:  As I came to you,
I saw on the way what was bad, and I struck the bad with a bad 
thing, and of what was bad the bad died. The princess, unable to
solve these puzzles, is obliged to accept foolish Iv&aacute;n.
(Afanasief,  Skazki, II, 225 ff, No 20, in Ralston's Songs of the
Russian People, p. 354 f.) Closely related to this tale, and
still nearer to one  another, are the Grimms' No 22, 'Das
R&auml;thsel' (see, also, the note in their third volume), and
the West Highland story, 'The  Ridere (Knight) of Riddles,'
Campbell, No  22, II, 27. In the former, as in the Russian  tale,
it is the princess that must be puzzled before she will yield her
hand; in the latter, an unmatchable beauty is to be had by no man
who does not put a question which her father  cannot solve.</p>

<a name="Page_I_418"/>
<p>Here may be put three drolleries, all clearly of the same
origin, in which a fool wins a princess by nonplussing her: 'The
Three Questions,' Halliwell's Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales,
p. 32; a "schwank" of the fourteenth century, by Heinz der
Kellner, von der Hagen's Gesammtabenteuer, No 63, III, 179 (there
very improperly called Turandot); 'Spurningen,' Asbj&oslash;rnson
og Moe, Norske Folkeeventyr, No 4, Dasent, Popular Tales from the
Norse, p. 148. According to the first of these, the king of the
East Angles promises his clever daughter to anyone who can answer
three of her questions (in the other versions, more correctly,
<i>silence</i> her). Three brothers, one of them a natural, set
out for the court, and, on the way, Jack finds successively an
egg, a crooked hazel-stick, and a nut, and each time explodes with
laughter. When they are ushered into the presence, Jack bawls
out, What a troop of fair ladies! "Yes," says the princess, "we
are fair ladies, for we carry fire in our bosoms." "Then roast me
an egg," says Jack, pulling out the egg from his pocket. "How
will you get it out again?" asks the princess? "With a crooked
stick," says Jack, producing the same. "Where did that come
from?" says the princess. "From a nut," answers Jack, pulling out
the nut. And so, as the princess is silenced, the fool gets her
in marriage.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d046_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Even nowadays riddles play a noteworthy part in the marriages
of Russian peasants. In the government Pskof, as we are informed
by Khudyakof, the bridegroom's party is not admitted into the
bride's house until all the riddles given by the party of the
bride have been answered; whence the saying or proverb, to the
behoof of bridegrooms, Choose comrades that can guess riddles. In
the village of Davshina, in the Yaroslav government, the
bridegroom's best man presents himself at the bride's house on
the wedding-day, and finding a man, called the-bride-seller,
sitting by the bride, asks him to surrender the bride and vacate
his place. "Fair and softly," answers the seller; "you will not
get the bride for nothing; make us a bid, if you will. And how
will you trade? will you pay in riddles or in gold?" If the best
man is prepared for the emergency, as we must suppose he always
would be, he answers, I will pay in riddles. Half a dozen or more
riddles are now put by the seller, of which these are favorable
specimens: Give me the sea, full to the brim, and with a bottom
of silver. The best man makes no answer in words, but fills a
bowl with beer and lays a coin at the bottom. Tell me the thing,
naked itself, which has a shift over its bosom. The best man
hands the seller a candle. Finally the seller says, Give me
something which the master of this house lacks. The best man then
brings in the bridegroom. The seller gives up his seat, and hands
the best man a plate, saying, Put in this what all pretty girls
like. The best man puts in what money he thinks proper, the
bridesmaids take it and quit the house, and the bridegroom's
friends carry off the bride.</p>

<p>So, apparently in some ballad, a maid gives riddles, and will
marry only the man who will guess them.</p>

<p>In Radloff's Songs and Tales of the Turkish tribes in East
Siberia, I, 60, a father, wanting a wife for his son, applies to
another man, who has a marriageable daughter. The latter will not
make a match unless the young man's father will come to him with
pelt and sans pelt, by the road and not by the road, on a horse
and yet not on a horse: see 8 ff of this volume. The young man
gives his father proper instructions, and wins his wife.</p>

<p>A Lithuanian mother sends her daughter to the wood to fetch
"winter May and
<a name="Page_I_419"/>
summer snow." She meets a herdsman, and asks
where she can find these. The herdsman offers to teach her these
riddles in return for her love, and she complying with these
terms, gives her the answers: The evergreen tree is winter May,
and sea-foam is summer snow. Beitr&auml;ge zur Kunde Preussens,
1,515 (Rhesa), and Ausland, 1839, p. 1230.</p>

<p>The European tales, excepting the three drolleries (and even
they are perhaps to be regarded only as parodies of the others),
must be of Oriental derivation; but the far north presents us
with a similar story in the lay of Alv&iacute;ss, in the elder
Edda. The dwarf Alv&iacute;ss comes to claim Freya for his bride
by virtue of a promise from the gods. Thor<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d046_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> says that the
bride is in his charge, and that he was from home when the
promise was made: at any rate, Alv&iacute;ss shall not have the
maid unless he can answer all the questions that shall be put
him. Thor then requires Alv&iacute;ss to give him the names of
earth, heaven, moon, sun, etc., ending with barley and the poor
creature small beer, in all the worlds; that is, in the dialect
of the gods, of mankind, giants, elves, dwarfs, etc.
Alv&iacute;ss does this with such completeness as to extort Thor's
admiration, but is craftily detained in so doing till after
sunrise, when Thor cries, You are taken in! Above ground at dawn!
and the dwarf turns to stone.</p>
