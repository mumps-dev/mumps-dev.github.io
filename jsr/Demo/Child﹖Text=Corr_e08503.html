<h3>85. Lady Alice</h3>


<p>P. 279. The following version is printed by Mr. G.R. Tomson in
his Ballads of the North Countrie, 1888, p. 434, from a
Manuscript of Mrs. Rider Haggard.</p>

<h3>Giles Collins and Lady Annice</h3>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right">1 &nbsp;</td>
<td>Giles Collins said to his own mother,<br/>
'Mother, come bind up my head,<br/>
And send for the parson of our parish,<br/>
For to-morrow I shall be dead.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">2 &nbsp;</td>
<td>'And if that I be dead,<br/>
As I verily believe I shall,<br/>
O bury me not in our churchyard,<br/>
But under Lady Annice's wall.'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">3 &nbsp;</td>
<td>Lady Annice sat at her bower-window,<br/>
Mending of her night-coif,<br/>
When passing she saw as lovely a corpse<br/>
As ever she saw in her life.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">4 &nbsp;</td>
<td>'Set down, set down, ye six tall men,<br/>
Set down upon the plain,<br/>
That I may kiss those clay-cold lips<br/>
I neer shall kiss again.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">5 &nbsp;</td>
<td>'Set down, set down, ye six tall men,<br/>
That I may look thereon;<br/>
For to-morrow, before the cock it has crowd,<br/>
Giles Collins and I shall be one.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">7 &nbsp;</td>
<td>'What had you at Giles Collins's burying?<br/>
Very good ale and wine?<br/>
You shall have the same to-morrow night,<br/>
Much about the same time.'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">7 &nbsp;</td>
<td>Giles Collins died upon the eve,<br/>
This fair lady on the morrow;<br/>
Thus may you all now very well know<br/>
This couple died for sorrow.</td></tr>

<h3>Giles Collins</h3>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right">1 &nbsp;</td>
<td>Lady Annis she sat in her bay-window,<br/>
A-mending of her night-coif;<br/>
As she sat, she saw the handsomest corpse<br/>
That ever she saw in her life.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">2 &nbsp;</td>
<td>'Who bear ye there, ye four tall men?<br/>
Who bear ye on your shouldyers?'<br/>
' It is the body of Giles Collins,<br/>
An old true lovyer of yours.'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">3 &nbsp;</td>
<td>'Set 'n down, set 'n down,' Lady Annis she said,<br/>
'Set 'n down on the grass so trim;<br/>
Before the clock it strikes twelve this night,<br/>
My body shall lie beside him.'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">4 &nbsp;</td>
<td>Lady Annis then fitted on her night-coif,<br/>
Which fitted her wondrous well;<br/>
She then pierced her throat with a sharp-edgd knife,<br/>
As the four pall-bearers can tell.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">5 &nbsp;</td>
<td>Lady Annis was buried in the east church-yard,<br/>
Giles Collins was laid in the west,<br/>
And a lily grew out from Giles Collins's grave<br/>
Which touched Lady Annis's breast.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">6 &nbsp;</td>
<td>There blew a cold north-westerly wind,<br/>
And cut this lily in twain;<br/>
Which never there was seen before,<br/>
And it never will again.</td></tr>
