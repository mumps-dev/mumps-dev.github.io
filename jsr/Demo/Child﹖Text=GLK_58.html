<h3>58. Sir Patrick Spens</h3>

<p>This ballad is one of many which were first made known to the
world through Percy's Reliques. Percy's version remains,
poetically, the best. It may be a fragment, but the imagination
easily supplies all that may be wanting.</p>

<p>The versions fall into two classes. Of the copies here
printed, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> belong to the first group;
<b>G</b> belongs to the second, which is distinguished by
additional circumstances. Thus in the second group the
destination of the ship is Norway; the object of the voyage (not
told in <b>G</b>) is to bring home the king of Norway's daughter
(or the Scottish king's daughter), or to take out the Scottish
king's daughter to Norway, where she is to be queen. The ballad
may or may not be historical. Motherwell has suggested a
sufficiently plausible foundation. Margaret, daughter of
Alexander III, was married, in 1281, to Eric, King of Norway. She
was conducted to her husband, "brought home," in August of that
year, bv many knights and nobles. Many of these were drowned on
the return voyage. Margaret died in 1283, leaving a newly-born
daughter, to whom the crown of Scotland fell in 1286. A match was
proposed between the infant Margaret, called the Maid of Norway,
and the eldest son of Edward I of England. A deputation was sent
to Norway in 1290 to bring the princess over, but she died on the
voyage. According to one (untrustworthy) account she perished,
apparently in a storm, on the coasts of Bogban (Buchan?). No such
name as Patrick Spens is historically connected with any of these
occurrences; but the ballad might be substantially historical
though the command of the ship were invariably given (as it is in
one version) to Sir Andrew Wood, a distinguished admiral, who was
born a couple of centuries after the supposed event, and it might
be substantially historical though we could prove that Patrick
Spens was only a shipmaster, of purely local fame, who was lost
off Aberdour a couple of hundred years ago. The question cannot
be decided, and is of slight importance.</p>
