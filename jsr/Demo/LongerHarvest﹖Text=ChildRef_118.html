<h3>Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Guye of Gisborne,' Percy Manuscript, p. 262;
Hales and Furnivall, II, 227. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d11801.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>First printed in the Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, 1765,
I, 74, and, with less deviation from the original, in the fourth
edition, 1794, I, 81. Reprinted from the Reliques in Ritson's
Robin Hood, 1795, I, 114.</p>

<p>Robin Hood has had a dream that he has been beaten and bound
by two yeomen, who have taken away his bow. He vows that he will
have vengeance, and sets out in search of them with Little John.
Robin and John shoot as they go, till they come to the greenwood
and see a yeoman leaning against a tree, clad in a horse-hide,
with head, tail, and mane. John proposes to go to the yeoman to
ask his intentions. Robin considers this to be forward of John,
and speaks so roughly to him that John parts company, and returns
to Barnsdale. Things are in a bad way there: the sheriff of
Nottingham has attacked Robin's band; two have been slain;
Scarlett is flying, and the sheriff in pursuit with seven score
men. John sends an arrow at the pursuers, which kills one of
them; but his bow breaks, and John is made prisoner and tied to a
tree.</p>

<p>Robin learns from the man in horse-hide that he is seeking
Robin Hood, but has lost his way. Robin offers to be his guide,
and as they go through the wood proposes a shooting-match. Both
shoot well, but Robin so much the better that the other breaks
out into expressions of admiration, and asks his name. Tell me
thine first, says Robin. "I am Guy of Gisborne;" "and I Robin
Hood, whom thou long hast sought," They fight fiercely for two
hours; Robin stumbles and is hit, but invokes the Virgin's aid,
leaps up and kills Guy. He nicks Guy's face so that it cannot be
recognized, throws his own green gown over the body, puts on the
horse-hide, and blows Guy's horn. The sheriff hears in the sound
tidings that Guy has slain Robin, and thinks it is Guy that he
sees coming in the horse-hide. The supposed Guy is offered
anything that he will ask, but will take no reward but the boon
of serving the knave as he has the master. Robin hies to Little
John, looses him, and gives him Sir Guy's bow. The sheriff takes
to flight, but cannot outrun John's arrow, which cleaves his
heart.</p>

<p>The beginning, and perhaps the development, of the story might
have been more lucid but for verses lost at the very start. Robin
Hood dreams of two yeomen that beat and bind him, and goes to
seek them, "in greenwood where they be." Sir Guy being one, the
other person pointed at must of course be the sheriff of
Nottingham (who seems to be beyond his beat in Yorkshire,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d118_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
but outlaws can raise no questions of jurisdiction), in league
with Sir Guy (a Yorkshireman, who has done many a curst turn) for
the capture or slaying of Robin. The dream simply foreshadows
danger from two quarters. But Robin Hood is nowhere informed, as
we are, that the sheriff is out against him with seven score men,
has attacked his camp, and taken John prisoner. He knows nothing
of this so far on as stanza 45<sup>3</sup>, where, after killing
Guy, he says he will go to Barnsdale to see how his men are
faring. Why then does he make his arrangements in stanzas
42-45<sup>2</sup>, before he returns to Barnsdale, to pass
himself off for Sir Guy? Plainly this device is adopted with the
knowledge that John is a prisoner, and as a means of delivering
him; which all that follows shows. Our embarrassment is the
greater because we cannot point out any place in the story at
which the necessary information could have been conveyed; there
is no cranny where it could have been thrust in. It will not be
enough, therefore, to suppose that verses have dropped out; there
must also have been a considerable derangement of the story.</p>

<p>The abrupt transition from the introductory verses, 1,
2<sup>1,2</sup>, is found in Adam Bell, and the like occurs in
other ballads.</p>

<p>A fragment of a dramatic piece founded on the ballad of Guy of
Gisborne has been preserved in manuscript of the date of 1475, or
earlier.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d118_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In this, a knight, not named, engages to take Robin
Hood for the sheriff, and is promised gold and fee if he does.
The knight accosts Robin, and proposes that they shoot together.
They shoot, cast the stone, cast the axle-tree, perhaps wrestle
(for the knight has a fall), then fight to the utterance. Robin
has the mastery, cuts off the knight's head, and dons his
clothes, putting the head into his hood. He hears from a man who
comes along that Robin Hood and his men have been taken by the
sheriff, and says, Let us go kill the sheriff. Then follows, out
of the order of time, as is necessary in so brief a piece, the
capture of Friar Tuck and the others by the sheriff. The
variations from the Percy Manuscript story may be arbitrary, or
may be those of another version of the ballad. The friar is
called Tuck, as in the other play: see '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_121.html">Robin Hood and the Potter</a>'.</p>
