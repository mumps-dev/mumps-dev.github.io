<p>A song of 'Brume, brume on hil' is one of those named in The
Complaint of Scotland, 1549, p. 64 of Dr. J.A.H. Murray's
edition. "The foot of the song" is sung, with others, by Moros in
Wager's "very merry and pithy Comedy called The longer thou
livest the more fool thou art," c. 1568. 'Broom, broom on hil' is
also one of Captain Cox's "bunch of ballets and songs, all
auncient," No 53 of the collection, 1575.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d043_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The lines that
Moros sings are:</p>

<p>Brome, brome on hill,<br/>
The gentle brome on hill, hill,<br/>
Brome, brome on Hive hill,<br/>
The gentle brome on Hive hill,<br/>
The brome stands on Hive hill a.</p>

<p>"A more sanguine antiquary than the editor," says Scott,
"might perhaps endeavor to identify this poem, which is of
undoubted antiquity, with the 'Broom, broom on hill' mentioned
... as forming part of Captain Cox's collection." Assuredly
"Broom, broom on hill," if that were all, would justify no such
identification, but the occurrence of Hive hill, both in the
burden which Moros sings and in the eighth stanza of Scott's
ballad, is a circumstance that would embolden even a very
cautious antiquary, if he had received Hive hill from tradition,
and was therefore unaffected by a suspicion that this locality
had been introduced by an editor from the old song.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d043_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Most of the versions give no explicit account of the knight's
prolonged sleep. He must needs be asleep when the lady comes to
him, else there would be no story; but his heavy slumber, not
broken by all the efforts of his horse and his hawk, is as a
matter of course not natural; es geht nicht zu mit rechten
dingen; the witch-wife of <b>A</b> 4 is at the bottom of that.
And yet the broom-flowers strewed on his hals-bane in <b>A</b> 8,
<b>B</b> 3, and the roses in <b>D</b> 6, are only to be a sign
that the maid had been there and was gone. Considering the
character of many of Buchan's versions, we cannot feel sure that
<b>C</b> has not borrowed the second and third stanzas from
<b>B</b>, and the witch-wife, in the sixth, from <b>A</b>; but
<a name="Page_I_391"/>
it
would be extravagant to call in question the genuineness of
<b>C</b> as a whole. The eighth stanza gives us the light which
we require.</p>

<p>Ye'll pu the bloom frae aff the broom,<br/>
Strew 't at his head and feet,<br/>
And aye the thicker that ye do strew,<br/>
The sounder he will sleep.'</p>

<p>The silver belt about the knight's head in <b>A</b> 5 can
hardly have to do with his sleeping, and to me seems meaningless.
It is possible that roses are not used at random in <b>D</b> 6,
though, like the posie of pleasant perfume in <b>F</b> 9, they
serve only to prove that the lady had been there. An excrescence
on the dog-rose, rosenschwamm, schlafkunz, kunz, schlafapfel, it
is believed in Germany, if laid under a man's pillow, will make
him sleep till it is taken away. Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, p.
1008, and Deutsches W&ouml;rterbuch (Hildebrand), V, 2753 
<i>e</i>.</p>

<p><b>C</b> makes the lady hide in the broom to hear what the
knight will say when he wakes, and in this point agrees with the
broadside <b>F</b>, as also in the comment made by the men on
their master in stanza 24; cf. <b>F</b> 16.</p>

<p>Mr. J.W. Dixon has reprinted an Aldermary Churchyard copy of
the broadside, differing as to four or five words only from
<b>F</b>, in Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry
of England, p. 116, Percy Society, Volume XVII. The editor
remarks that <b>A</b> is evidently taken from <b>F</b>; from
which it is clear that the pungent buckishness of the broadside
does not necessarily make an impression. A smells of the broom;
<b>F</b> suggests the groom.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d043_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The sleep which is produced in <b>A</b> by strewing the flower
of the broom on a man's head and feet, according to a witch's
advice, is brought about in two Norse ballads by means not simply
occult, but altogether preternatural; that is, by the power of
runes. One of these, 'S&ouml;mn-runorna,' Arwidsson, II, 249, No
133, is preserved in a manuscript of the end of the seventeenth,
or the beginning of the eighteenth, century. The other,
'S&ouml;vnerunerne,' Grundtvig, II, 337, No 81, was taken down in
1847 from the singing of a woman seventy-five years of age.</p>

<p>The Swedish ballad runs thus. There is a damsel in our land
who every night will sleep with a man, and dance a maid in the
morning. The fame of this comes to the ears of the son of the
king of England, who orders his horse, thinking to catch this
damsel. When he arrives at the castle gate, there stands the
lady, and asks him what is his haste. He frankly answers that he
expects to get a fair maid's honor for his pains, and she bids
him follow her to the upper room. She lays sheets on the bed, and
writes strong runes on them. The youth sits down on the bed, and
is asleep before he can stretch himself out. He sleeps through
that day, and the next, and into the third. Then the lady rouses
him. "Wake up; you are sleeping your two eyes out." He is still so
heavy that he can hardly stir. He offers her his horse and saddle
to report the matter as he wishes. "Keep your horse," she says;
"shame fa such liars."</p>

<p>The Danish story is much the same. One of a king's five sons
goes to make trial of the maid. She tells him to fasten his horse
while she goes before and unlocks; calls to her maid to bring
five feather-beds, feather-beds nine, and write a sleep on each
of them. He sleeps through three days, and is roused the fourth,
with "Wake up, wake up; you have slept away your pluck." He
offers her a bribe, as before, which she scornfully rejects,
assuring him that he will not be spared when she comes among
maids and knights.</p>

<p>A sleep produced by runes or gramarye is one of the two main
incidents of a tale in the Gesta Romanorum, better known through
the other, which is the forfeit of flesh for money not
forthcoming at the day set, as in the Merchant of Venice: Latin,
Oesterley, No 195, p. 603;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d043_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> English, Harleian Manuscript
7333, No 40, printed by Douce, Illustrations of Shakspere, I,
281, Madden, p. 130, Herrtage, p. 158; German, No 68, of the
printed edition of 1489 (which I have not seen). A knight,
<a name="Page_I_392"/>
who
has a passion for an emperor's daughter, engages to give a
thousand [hundred] marks for being once admitted to her bed. He
instantly falls asleep, and has to be roused in the morning. Like
terms are made for a second night, and the man's lands have to be
pledged to raise the money. He sleeps as before, but stipulates
for a third night at the same price. A merchant lends him the
thousand marks, on condition that, if he breaks his day, his
creditor may take the money's weight of flesh from his body.
Feeling what a risk he is now running, the knight consults a
philosopher, Virgil, in the English version. The philosopher (who
in the Latin version says he ought to know, for he had helped the
lady to her trick) tells the knight that between the sheet and
coverlet of the bed there is a letter, which causes the sleep;
this he must find, and, when found, cast far from the bed. The
knight follows these directions, and gets the better of the lady,
who conceives a reciprocal passion for him, and delivers him, in
the sequel, from the fearful penalty of his bond by pleading that
the flesh must be taken without shedding of blood.</p>

<p>The romance of Dolopathos, a variety of the Seven "Vise
Masters, written about 1185, considerably before the earliest
date which has hitherto been proposed for the compilation of the
Gesta, has this story, with variations, of which only these
require to be noted. The lady has herself been a student in magic.
She is wooed of many; all comers are received, and pay a hundred
marks; anyone who accomplishes his will may wed her the next day.
An enchanted feather of a screech-owl, laid under the pillow,
makes all who enter the bed fall asleep at once, and many bave
been baffled by this charm. At last a youth of high birth, but
small means, tries his fortune, and, failing at the first essay,
tries once more. Thinking that the softness of his couch was the
cause of his falling asleep, he puts away the pillow, and in this
process the feather is thrown out: Iohannis de Alta Silva
Dolopathos, ed. esterley, pp 57-59; Herbers, Romans de
Dolopathos, Brunet et Montaiglon, vv 7096-7498, pp 244-59; Le
Roux de Lincy, in a sequel to Loiseleur-Deslongchamps's Essai sur
les Fables indiennes, pp 211 ff. This form of the tale is found
in German, in a fifteenth-century manuscript, from which it was
printed by Haupt in Altdeutsche Bl&auml;tter, I 143-49; but here
the sleep is produced by the use of <i>both</i> the means
employed in the Gesta and in Dolopathos, letter (runes) and
feather. "the wild man's feather."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d043_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Magic is dropped, and a sleeping draught administered, just as
the man is going to bed, in a version of the story in the
Pecorone of Ser Giovanni Fiorentino, Giornata, IV<sup>a</sup>,
Nov. 1<sub>a</sub> (last quarter of the fourteenth century). Upon
the third trial the man, warned by a friendly chambermaid not to
drink, pours the medicated wine into his bosom. The account of
Ser Giovanni is adopted in Les Adventures d'Abdalla fils d'Hanif,
etc., La Haye, 1713. Biblioth&egrave;que de Romans, 1778,
Janvier, I, 112-14, 143 f.</p>

<p>Ellin writes sleep-runes on the cushions on which her husband
is to sleep, in the Danish ballad 'Fr&aelig;ndeh&aelig;vn,'
Grundtvig, No 4, <b>A</b> 31 [<b>C</b> 45J.</p>

<p>In Icelandic tales a sleep-thorn<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d043_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> is employed, probably a
thorn inscribed with runes. The thorn is stuck into the clothes
or into the head (the ears, according to the popular notion,
Vigfusson), and the sleep lasts till the thorn is taken out. Odin
stuck such a thorn into Brynhild's garments:
F&aacute;fnism&aacute;l, 43; Sigrdr&iacute;fum&aacute;l, 7;
V&ouml;ls&uacute;nga Saga, Fornaldar S&ouml;gur, I, 166. The
thorn is put into the clothes also in the Icelandic fairy-tale,
M&aelig;r&thorn;&ouml;ll, Maurer, Isl&auml;ndische Volkssagen, p.
286. &Oacute;l&ouml;f, to save herself from Helgi's violence, and
to punish his insolence, sticks him with a sleep-thorn after he
is dead drunk: Hr&oacute;lfs
<a name="Page_I_393"/>
Saga Kraka, Forn. S. I, 18 f,
Torf&aelig;us, p. 32. Vilhj&aacute;lmr sticks a sleep-thorn into
Hr&oacute;lfr, and he lies as if dead so long as the thorn is in
him: Gaungu-Hr&oacute;lfs Saga, Forn. S., III, 303, 306.</p>

<p>A pillow of soporific quality, which Kamele, by Isot's
direction, puts under Kaedin's head, assures her safety though
she lies all night by his side: Ulrich's continuation of
Gottfried's Tristan, vv 1668-99, 1744-85; and Heinrich's
continuation, omitting the last circumstance, vv 4861-4960 (J.
Grimm).</p>

<p>The witch-woman, in the English ballad, <b>A</b> 4, represents
the philosopher in the Gesta, and the wager in the other versions
the fee or fine exacted by the lady in the Gesta and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>An Italian ballad, a slight and unmeritable thing, follows the
story of Ser Giovanni, or agrees with it, in respect to the
sleeping draught. A man falls in with a girl at a spring, and
offers her a hundred ducats, or scudi, per una nottina. The girl
says that she must consult her mother. The mother advises her to
accept the offer: she will give the man a drug, and the money
will serve for a dowry. The man, roused in the morning, counts
out the money with one hand and wipes his eyes with the other.
When asked why he is crying, he replies that the money is not the
loss he weeps for, and makes a second offer of the same amount.
The girl wishes to refer the matter to her mother again, but the
gallant says the mother shall not take him in a second time. One
version (<b>A</b>) ends somewhat more respectably: the girl
declares that, having come off with her honor once, she will not
again expose herself to shame. <b>A</b>. Ferraro, Canti popolari

<p>'The Sleepy Merchant,' a modern ballad, in Kinloch's
Manuscripts, V, 26, was perhaps fashioned on some traditional
report of the story in Il Pecorone. The girl gives the merchant a
drink, and when the sun is up starts to her feet, crying, "I'm a
leal maiden yet!" The merchant comes back, and gets another dram,
but "tooms it a' between the bolster and the wa," and then sits
up and sings.</p>

<p>A ballad found everywhere in Germany, but always in what
appears to be an extremely defective form, must originally, one
would think, have had some connection with those which we are
considering. A hunter meets a girl on the heath, and takes her
with him to his hut, where they pass the night. She rouses him in
the morning, and proclaims herself still a maid. The hunter is so
chagrined that he is of a mind to kill her, but spares her life.
