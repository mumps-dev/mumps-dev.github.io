<h3>33. Kempy Kay</h3>


<p>P. 301. <b>A</b> was communicated to C.K. Sharpe by Robert
Pitcairn with the stanzas in the order printed by Sharpe. The
arrangement in <b>A</b> would seem, therefore, to have been an
afterthought of Pitcairn's. There is some slight difference of
reading, also, in Pitcairn's Manuscript, and one defect is
supplied. The variations in the copy sent Sharpe are (besides the
order, as aforesaid) as follows:</p>

<table>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</td>

in a letter of December 6, 1824, the fourth stanza is 
lacking, the fifth is third.</p>

<p>P. 300. I have serious doubts whether this offensive ballad
has not been made too important; whether, notwithstanding the
points noted at p. 301, it is anything more than a variety of
'The Queen of all Sluts.'</p>

<p>305 b. <b>A</b> 10<sup>1</sup>. <i>lauchty</i> in Sharpe with
a line drawn in ink through l (probably by the editor, as this is
a presentation copy).</p>

<p>V, 213 a. Since we have Pitcairn's copy only in Sharpe's
handwriting, we cannot determine which of the two made the
changes.</p>
