<h3>29. The Boy and the Mantle</h3>

<p>This ballad and the two which follow it are clearly not of the
same rise, and not meant for the same ears, as those which go
before. They would come down by professional rather than by
domestic tradition, through minstrels rather than knitters and
weavers. They suit the hall better than the bower, the tavern or
public square better than the cottage, and would not go to the
spinning-wheel at all. 'The Boy and the Mantle' is an exceedingly
good piece of minstrelsy; much livelier than most of the numerous
variations on the somewhat overhandled theme. Its nearest
relative is the fabliau or "romance" of 'Le Mantel Mautaillie',
'Cort Mantel' (Montaiglon et Raynaud, Reeueil General des
Fabliaux, ni, 1), of which there are manuscripts of the
thirteenth century. The outline of a similar tale is preserved in
the Lanzelet of Ulrieh von Zatzikhoven.</p>

<p>The probation by the Horn runs parallel with that of the
Mantle, with which it is combined in the English ballad. Whether
this or that is the anterior creation it is not possible to say,
though the 'Lai du Corn' is of a more original stamp, fresher and
more in the popular vein than the fabliau of the Mantle, as we
have it. The 'Lai du Corn.' by Robert Bikez, is ascribed to the
middle of the twelfth century. Like the ballad, it makes Caradoc
(Garadue) the hero. This is also the case in the 'Livre de
Caradoc,' inserted in the verse romance of Percival li Gallois
(ed. Potvin, vv. 15,640 ff.). There are several other 
versions.</p>

<p>Besides the stories of probation by the Mantle and by the Horn
or cup there are a number of others in which other objects have
the same testing power; &mdash; viz.: a crown; a bridge; a
girdle; an arch; a glove; a garland; a cup of congealed tears;
bedclothes and bed (as in No. 5); a stepping-stone by the
bed-side; a chair; flowers; a shirt, a sword, a picture; a wax
image; a ring (as in the romance of Horn Child); a mirror; a
harp; a crystal brook; a stone; a magnet; a statue; a shield; a
chess-board, etc.</p>
