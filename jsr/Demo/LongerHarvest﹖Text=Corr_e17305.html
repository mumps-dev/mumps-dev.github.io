<p>392 a, <b>H</b> 8<sup>4</sup>. The nine. "Anciently the

<p>P. 882. The passages following relate to the affair of the
Frenchwoman and the apothecary. Calendar of State Papers, Foreign
Series, of the Reign of Elizabeth, 1563. (Indicated to me by Mr.
Andrew Lang.)</p>

<p>The Queen's apothecary got one of her maidens, a Frenchwoman,
with child. Thinking to have covered his fault with medicine, the
child was slain. They are both in prison, and she is so much
offended that it is thought they shall both die. Randolph to
Cecil, Edinburgh, 21 Dec., 1563, p. 637. The apothecary and the
woman he got with child were both hanged this Friday. Randolph to
Cecil, Dec. 31, 1563, p. 650.</p>

<p>The heroine of this ballad is Mary Hamilton in all copies in
which she has a full name, that is, twelve out of the twenty-four
which have any name; Mary simply, or Mary mild,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_e17305_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> is found in
eleven copies, and Maisry in one. Finding in the history of the
court of Peter the Great an exact counterpart of the story of the
ballad with a maid of honor named Mary Hamilton filling the
tragic role, and "no trace of an admixture of the Russian story
with that of the Frenchwoman and the queen's apothecary," I felt
compelled to admit that Sharpe's suggestion of the Russian origin
of the ballad was, however surprising, the only tenable opinion
(III, 382 f.). Somewhat later a version of the ballad (<b>U</b>)
was found at Abbotsford in which there is mention of the
apothecary and of the practices for which he suffered in 1563,
and this fact furnished ground for reopening the question (which,
nevertheless, was deferred).</p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Lang has recently subjected the matter of the
origin of the ballad to a searching review (in Blackwood's
Magazine, September, 1895, p. 381 ff.). Against the improbability
that an historical event of 1718-9 should by simple chance
coincide, very minutely and even to the inclusion of the name of
the principal actor, with what is related in a ballad ostensibly
recounting an event in the reign of Mary Stuart, he sets the
improbability that a ballad, older and superior in style to
anything which we can show to have been produced in the 18th, or
even the 17th century,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_e17305_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> should have been composed after 1719,
a ballad in which a contemporary occurrence in a foreign and
remote country would be transferred to Scotland and Queen Mary's
day, and so treated as to fit perfectly into the circumstances of
the time: and this while the ballad might entirely well have been
evolved from a notorious domestic occurrence of the date 1563,
the adventure of Queen Mary's French maid and the apothecary
which has now turned out to be introduced into one version of the
ballad.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_e17305_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>I wish to avow that the latter improbability, as put by Mr.
Lang, has come to seem to me considerably greater than the
former.</p>

<p>The coincidence of the name of the heroine is indeed at first
staggering; but it will be granted that of all the "honorable
houses" no one might more plausibly supply a forgotten maid of
honor than the house of Hamilton. The Christian name is a matter
of course for a Queen's Mary.</p>
