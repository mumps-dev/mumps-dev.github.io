<h3>Will Steward and John</h3>

<li>'Will Stewart and John,' Percy Manuscript, p.

<p>The fragment <b>B</b> is disordered as well as mutilated.
<b>B</b> 1 corresponds to <b>A</b> 18, 13; 2 to 14; 3 to 19, 40;
4 to 41, 42; 5 to 43; 6 to 35, 36; 7 to 17. It is simply a
confused recollection of some parts of the ballad.</p>

<p>The first stanza furnishes a sort of general lyrical
introduction, and does not belong to the story, to which, as I
conceive, the circumstance that Adlatts Park is wide and broad is
of no more special pertinence than the other which follows, that
grass grows green in our countrye. See I, 7, note.</p>

<p>Will Stewart, of Argyle Castle, languishes with love for the
Earl of Mar's daughter, and lies in care-bed. His younger
brother, John, a wiser man, offers to go a-wooing for his
brother, and to forward his object takes service with the Earl of
Mar as chamberlain to his daughter. One Sunday, as John is
conveying the lady home from church, he makes known to her that
he is a messenger. The lady at first, like Shakspere's Olivia,
would rather he should speak for himself, but upon hearing what
John has to say for his brother is ready to love Will heartily.
She bids her lover come with a hundred men to a foot-ball match
on Sunday after St. Andrew's day. He must play sixteen games, and
if he win the greater part she shall love him the more. This
tidings makes Will Stewart leap from care-bed. He chooses a
hundred men from eleven score and three, dresses them in green,
himself in scarlet (about which the lady had been particular),
meets his mistress at the rendezvous, gives her a kiss of
courtesy, and wins twelve of the sixteen games. The Earl of Mar
invites Will to his house, where the Stewart avows his love for
his daughter; he knows not whether the lady loves him. "God for
bid!" exclaims the earl. "I would rather thou wert hanged or
burned. To thy chamber, lady, or I will beat thee before the
Stewart's eye." Will, with John, who renounces Mar's service,
returns to Argyle Castle, and Will leaps into care-bed again. A
parliament is held at Edinburgh, to which both brothers are
summoned. Mar discovers that Will is an earl's son, and even the
king's cousin, but this discovery has no effect to change the
mind of the peremptory noble man. Will and John go back to Argyle
Castle when the parliament is done, and Will once more leaps into
care-bed. John, in great concern for his brother, offers to go
a-wooing for him again. He disguises himself as a beggar, comes
to Mar's house on a dole-day, makes his way to the lady and
sticks by her till all the beggars are gone, and then tells her
that he is no beggar, but a messenger. The lady, reproached for
her cruelty, says the blame is not hers, and appoints Will to
meet her within three days at Martinsdale with a hundred men,
they and he dressed as before. Will leaps out of care-bed,
chooses a hundred of the best out of eleven score men and three,
rides to Martinsdale, and finds the true lady waiting for him.
They send for priest and clerk and are married, and she goes home
with Will. A twelvemonth after, John is despatched to bid the
Earl of Mar to a christening. John frightens the earl with an
intimation that his daughter will now be returned on his hands.
This brings the wilful father round. The marriage ceremony is
performed over again, and Will made Earl of Mar.</p>

<p>As Mr. Hales has remarked, Bishop Percy's Folio Manuscript,
III, 215, the allusions to manners and customs are highly
interesting: as, to foot-ball matches. 27; to the kiss of
courtesy, 35<sup>3</sup>; to the beating of daughters,
42<sup>4</sup>, 43<sup>3</sup>; to the dole-day, 66<sup>2</sup>;
to the beggar's dress and equipment, 61, 78<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>The superfluous <i>that</i> in 3<sup>4</sup>, 16<sup>3</sup>,
18<sup>4</sup>, 38<sup>1</sup>, 68<sup>1</sup>, 89<sup>2</sup>,
is common in the ballads of the Percy manuscript.</p>
