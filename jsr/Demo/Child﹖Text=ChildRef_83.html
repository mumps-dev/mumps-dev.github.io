<p><b>A</b> was printed from the Percy manuscript by Jamieson, in
his Popular Ballads, I, 8. Of <b>B</b> Motherwell says, 1827: "By
testimony of a most unexceptionable description, but which it
would be tedious here to detail, the editor can distinctly trace
this ballad as existing in its present shape at least a century
ago."</p>

<p>In his preface to the copy of the ballad in the Reliques of
Ancient Poetry (F), Percy remarks: "The following piece has
lately run through two editions in Scotland, the second printed
at Glasgow in 1755, 8vo. Prefixed to them both is an
advertisement, setting forth that the preservation of this poem
was owing 'to a lady, who favored the printers with a copy as it
was carefully collected from the mouths of old women and nurses;'
and 'any reader that can render it more correct or complete' is
desired to oblige the public with such improvements. In
consequence of this advertisement sixteen additional verses have
been produced and handed about in manuscript, which are here
inserted in their proper places." The copy printed in 1755<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d083_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
and earlier had already "received very considerable modern
improvements," as Percy goes on to say, the most noticeable of
which is a conclusion of eight stanzas, in the taste of the
middle of the last century. These, as also the four stanzas which
had been handed about in man uscript, are omitted from this
reprint.</p>

<p>Home's tragedy of Douglas, produced in Edinburgh in 1756, was founded upon
the story of Gil Morice, and the popularity of the play seems to have given
vogue to the ballad.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d083_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The sophisticated copy passed into recitation, and
may very likely have more or less infected those which were repeated from
earlier tradition. An old woman (Mrs. Thomson, the reciter of <b>B</b>), who
was born about the time when the ballad was printed, told Motherwell that she
had learned 'Chield Morice' in her infancy from her grandmother, but at a
later period of her life committed to memory 'Gil Morice,' "which began, with
young lasses like her, to be a greater favorite and more fashionable than the
set which her grand mother and old folks used to sing."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d083_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Gray writes to Mason, June, 1757 (?): "I have got the old Scotch ballad on
which Douglas was founded; it is divine, and as long as from hence [Cambridge]
to Aston."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d083_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> He cites the first fifteen lines.</p>

<p>The copy in Smith's Scottish Minstrel, III, 106, is Herd's (Percy's), with
omissions and changes. 'Child Nourice,' a fragment, in Buchan's Manuscripts,
I, 143, is of recent make.</p>

<p>The name of Barnard, a name, says Aytoun, quite foreign to Scotland, may
have been adopted from 'Little Musgrave.' There is a marked similarity in the
conclusion of the two ballads.</p>

<p>Aytoun, in his compilation, <b>J</b>, 147, 149, rejects the two stanzas,
<b>F</b> 13, 14, beginning, "And when he came to broken brigue," as taken from
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_65.html">Lady Maisry</a>.' These stanzas are the most favorite of
all commonplaces, and
belong as much to one ballad as another. They occur in one version or another
of 'Lord Ingram,' 'Little Musgrave,' 'The Clerk's Twa Sons,' etc., and
wearisomely often in the ballads in Buchan's collection.</p>

<p>The popularity of 'Gil Morice' since the middle of the last century has
caused the story to be localized. The green wood, says Motherwell, was
believed to be "the ancient forest of Dundaff, in Stirlingshire, and Lord
Barnard's castle to have occupied a precipitous cliff overhanging the Water of
Carron, on the lands of Halbertshire." Gil Morice, "according to the unvarying
traditions of the country, was remarkable for the extreme length and
loveliness of his yellow hair." Motherwell considers that the embellishments
of the ballad may have been suggested by these traditions. But why should not
these traditions have been derived from the embellished ballad? There had
already been nearly four score years for them to grow up at the date of the
publication of his Minstrelsy.</p>
