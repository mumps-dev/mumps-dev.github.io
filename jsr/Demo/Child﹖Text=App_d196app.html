<p>My friend the late Mr. Norval Clyne thought that this obscure
stanza might perhaps be cleared up by the following verses,
communicated to him in 1873 by the Rev. George Sutherland,
Episcopal clergyman at Tillymorgan, Aberdeenshire.</p>

<h3>Young Tolquhon</h3>

Cause write upon me so:<br/>
"Here lies a lad who died for love,<br/>
And who can blame my woe."'</td></tr>

<p>Mr. Sutherland wrote: This fragment I took down from the
recitation of my mother, twenty or twenty-five years ago. She was
born in 1790, and her great-grandmother was a servant of the last
Forbes of Tolquhon. She had a tradition that Sophia Hay was one
of the Errol family, and married Lord John Gordon, who was burned
at Frendraught. Mr. Clyne remarked: The Young Tolquhon at the
time of this marriage, about 1628, was Alexander Forbes, eldest
son of William Forbes of Tolquhon. Alexander is recorded to have
died without issue, and the following additional particulars,
singularly suggestive of a determination on the unfortunate
lover's part to renounce the world, have been communicated to me
by Dr. John Stuart. In 1631 William Forbes granted a charter of
the lands of Tolquhon to his second son Walter and his heirs
male, and in 1632 another deed of the same sort to Walter, with
the express consent of Alexander, his elder brother. In 1641
Alexander is supposed to have been dead, as Walter is then styled
"of Tolquhon." The lady's somewhat enigmatical exclamation,</p>

<p>'I wan a sair heart when I married him,<br/>
And the day it 's well returned again,'</p>

<p>may have its explanation in the words of Young Tolquhon,</p>

<p>'I wish her anes as sair a heart<br/>
As she 's gien me the day.'</p>

<p>Mr. Clyne did not fail to observe that Father Blakhal has
recorded of Lady Melgum that he had often heard her say that she
had never loved anybody but her husband, and never would love
another (Narration, p. 92). This testimony, if not decisive, may
be considered not less cogent as to the matter of fact than
anything in 'Young Tolquhon' to the contrary. But it may be that
stanza 24 became attached to the Frendraught ballad in
consequence of the coexistence of this or some similar ballad of
Young Tolquhon.</p>
