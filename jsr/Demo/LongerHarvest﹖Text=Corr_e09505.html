<h3>95. The Maid Freed From the Gallows</h3>


<p>P. 346,111, 516 a, IV, 481 b. <b>Italian</b>. Maria Carmi,
Canti pop. Emiliani, Archivio, XII, 189. Brunetina, after she has
been rescued by her lover, is informed, while she is dancing at a
ball, that her mother is dead. Bury her, she replies, I will
dress in complete red, and she goes on dancing. So of her father.
But when told that her lover is dead, she says she will dress in
complete black, and bids the music stop, for she wishes to dance
no more. 'La Ballerina,' Nigra, No 107, p. 469, is no doubt the
last half of this ballad corrupted at the conclusion. The woman
will not stop dancing for the reported death of father, mother,
brother, sister, husband, but when told that her boy is dead asks
the players to cease, her legs are broken, she can dance no
more.</p>

<p>In 'Leggenda Marinesca' (di Catanzaro), La Calabria, October,
1893, VI, 16, a wife (or perhaps an affianced young woman) is
ransomed from pirates by her husband (or betrothed), after
father, mother, and brother have refused. If her father, mother,
brother, should die, she would deck her hair, dress in red,
yellow, or white, bid the guitar strike up, and dance; but if her
true-love died, she would put on black, cut her hair, and throw
the guitar into the sea.</p>

<p>349. Mr. Kaarle Krohn, of the University of Helsingfors, has
favored me with the following study of the very numerous Finnish
and Esthonian versions of this ballad, incorporating therein the
researches of his father, Julius Krohn, already referred to at
IV, 482 a. (Estlander's discussion, which I had not seen,
"S&aring;ngen om den frik&ouml;pta," occupies pp. 331-356 of the
tenth volume of Finsk Tidskrift.)</p>

<p>I. The West Finnish versions, dispersed over West and East
Finland and Ingria. These are in the modern metre, which came
into use hardly before the end of the seventeenth century, and it
is in the highest degree probable that they were learned from the
Swedes. About thirty copies known. Specimen, Reinholm's
collection, <b>H</b> 12, No 76, from the Nystad district
northward from Abo, in Southwest Finland; J.K., p. 11.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_e09505_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Prevailing traits: 1. The maid is sitting in a little room,
less frequently in a ship's cabin or a boat. 2. The father has
three horses. 3. The mother has three cows. 4. The brother has
three swords. 5. The sister has three crowns, or, in copies from
further east, where crowns are not used for head-gear, three silk
kerchiefs. 6. The lover has three ships, or almost as often three
castles (mansions). There are variations, but rarely, as to the
objects possessed, and sometimes exchanges, but only two cases
are of importance. In one copy from the extreme of Southeast
Finland, the father has three oxen, which seems to be the
original disposition, the change to horses coming about from the
circumstance that oxen are seldom employed for ploughing in
Finland. In four copies from the most eastern part of Finland the
sister has three sheep, perhaps owing to the influence of the
East Finnish versions. 7. The imprecations and benedictions at
the end occur regularly. May the horses be knocked up or die at
ploughing-time; may the cows die, dry up, etc., at milking-time;
the swords shiver in war-time; the crowns fall off or melt at
wedding or dance (the silk kerchiefs tear, fade, spoil with wet);
and on the other hand, may the ships sail well, do well, make
money at trading-time; the castles rise, flourish in time of
destitution, of bad crops. Etc.</p>

<p>II. The later Esthonian versions, Esthonia and Livonia, in
modern metre, of more recent origin, probably, than in Finland.
About twenty copies known. Specimen, J. Hurt, Vana Kannel, II,
365, No 367. Lilla is sitting in the little room in weary
expectation. She sees her father walking on the sea-beach. 'Dear
father, beloved father, ransom me!' 'Wherewith ransom you, when I
have no money?' 'You have three horses at home, and can pawn
one.' 'I can do better without my Lilla than without my three
horses; the horses are mine for all my life, Lilla for a short
time.' In like fashion, the mother is not willing to sacrifice
one of her three cows, the brother one of his three swords, the
sister one of her three rings. But the lover, who has three
ships, says, I can better give up a ship than give up my dear
Lilla; my ships are mine for a short time, but Lilla for all my
life. Lilla breaks out in execrations: may her father's horses
fall dead when they are ploughing in summer, may her mother's
cows dry up in milking, her brother's swords shiver in war, her
sister's rings break in the very act of marrying; but may her
true-love's ships long bring home precious wares.</p>

<p>Prevailing traits: 1. Lilla; in some copies from East Livonia,
Roosi. 2. Little room; quite as often prison-tower. 3. The father
has horses, the mother cows, the brother swords, as in the West
Finnish versions. The independency of the Esthonian ballad is
exhibited in the sister's three rings. It must, as far as I can
at present see, have been borrowed directly from the Swedish, not
through the medium of the Finnish. The lover has always three
ships, and it is often wished that these ships may sail well in
storm and in winter. The maledictions occur regularly, as in the
example cited. There are some divergences as to the items of
property, mostly occasioned by the older Esthonian version: thus,
the father has sometimes oxen or corn-lofts, the brother horses,
the sister brooches.</p>

<p>III. The older Esthonian versions, disseminated in Esthonia
and Livonia, and also among the orthodox Esthonians beyond Pskov.
These are in the old eight-syllable measure of the runes (and of
Kalevala). More than a hundred copies have been obtained.</p>

<p><b>a</b>. Best preserved and of most frequent occurrence in
the island of Osel. Twenty copies. Specimen from J. Hurt's
manuscript collections. Anne goes into the cow-house and soils
her cap. She proceeds to the sea-beach to wash her cap. Ships
come from Russia, from Courland. Anne is made captive. She weeps,
and begs that the ship may be stopped; she wishes to take a look
homewards. Her father has three oxen, one of which has silver
horns, another copper, the third golden, but he will give none of
them for her. Her mother has three cows, with silver, copper,
golden udders; her brother, three horses, with the same variety
of manes; her sister, three sheep, with wool of the three sorts;
a neighbor's son, three lofts full of wheat, rye, barley. She
wishes that the oxen may die in ploughing-time, the cows in
milk-time, the horses at wooing-time, the sheep at wool-time; but
may the corn-lofts of the neighbor's son grow fuller in the
direst famine-time.</p>

<p>Prevailing traits: 1. The maid's name is Anne. 2. The pirates
are Russians (10 times), Poles (6), Courlanders (2), Swedes (1),
Germans (1), English (1). 3. The father has commonly oxen; the
mother, cows always; the brother, almost always horses; the
sister, sheep, six times, oftener than anything else; the lover,
ordinarily corn-lofts. 4. The cursing occurs ten times. There are
in a few cases exchanges of the sorts of property (thus, the
father has corn-lofts, the sister has brooches, each four times),
and in two instances the lover is omitted. The ballad has perhaps
been affected by another (see II, 347 f.) in which a girl
receives information that she has been sold by her relations: by
her father for a pair of oxen (25 cases) or for a horse (18), by
her mother for a cow, by her brother for a horse (24) or for a
pair of oxen (14), by her sister for a brooch; and she curses all
that they have got by the sale.</p>

<p><b>b</b>. Less perfect and not so well preserved on the
Esthonian mainland. About 100 copies, more or fewer. Specimens,
Neus, p. 109, No 34, Hurt, Vana Kannel, I, 166, No 103, II, 310,
No 442.</p>

<p>Prevailing traits: 1. The name of the maid, Anne, and the
introduction linked to it, are often dropped, especially in the
southeast of the Esthonian district, and a passage about a young
conscript who wishes to be bought off from serving is
substituted. The maid, whose brothers have hidden away, is
pressed instead of them, and sent into service. As she is driven
by the house of her parents in the military wagon she entreats
her guards not to make sail! 2. The kidnapper is most frequently
a Russian, then Pole, Swede, less commonly German, Courlander. In
the northeast of the Esthonian district, on the border of Ingria,
Karelian, four times. 3. The father often keeps the oxen, but
almost as often has horses; the brother, in these last cases, has
seldom oxen, generally horses as well as the father. The
alteration is in part owing to the same material occasion as in
the West Finnish versions; sometimes an influence from the ballad
of the maiden who has been sold by her relatives may be suspected
(in which ballad it is not easy to say whether the oxen belong
originally to father or brother). Frequently the father has
corn-lofts, the lover, to whom these would belong, having dropped
out. The mother has almost always cows; in the northeast, on the
Ingrian border, three times, aprons. The brother has generally
horses, five times oxen, with other individual variations. The
sister has preserved the sheep only four times; eight times she
has brooches, and in one of these cases the ballad of the maid
sold by her relatives is blended with ours, while in the
remainder the influence of that ballad is observable. In six
cases she has rings, perhaps under the influence of the later
Esthonian versions. In the southeast she has chests seven times,
and in most of these cases the lover has the rings. Other
variations occur from one to four times. The lover has his
corn-lofts nine times. Eight times he has horses, and in half of
these instances he has exchanged with the brother, or both have
horses. Twice he has ships, through the influence of the later
Esthonian versions; or rings, in which cases the father
ordinarily has the corn-lofts. 4. The imprecation in the
conclusion is but rarely preserved.</p>

<p>IV. The East Finnish versions. Diffused in Ingria, East
Finland, and Russian Karelia. In the old rune-measure, about
forty copies. Specimen, Ahlqvist's collection, from East Finland,
No 351: see J.K., p. 11.</p>

<p>Prevailing traits: 1. The maid is in a boat on the Neva. 2.
The kidnapper is a Russian. 3. The father has a horse, the mother
a cow, the brother a horse, the sister a sheep (each with an
epithet). 4. The imprecation is almost without exception
preserved. This version arose from a blending of the West
Finnish, I, the older Esthonian, III, and the ballad of the maid
sold by her relatives. This latter occurs in West Ingria in the
following shape: The maid gets tidings that she has been sold.
The father has received for her a gold-horse (may it founder when
on the way to earn gold!), the mother a portly cow (may it spill
its milk on the ground!), the brother a war-horse (may the horse
founder on the war-path!), the sister a bluish sheep (may wolf
and bear rend it!). In some copies the father or the brother has
oxen (may they fall dead in ploughing!), as in the Esthonian
ballad, from which the Ingrian is borrowed. The sister's sheep
instead of brooch shows perhaps the influence of the older
Esthonian ballad of the maid begging to be ransomed, or it may be
an innovation.</p>

<p>The ballad of the maid sold by her family occurs in West
Ingria independently, and also as an introduction to the other,
and has been the occasion for the changes in the possessions of
the relatives. North of St. Petersburg the combination is not
found, though it has left its traces in the course of the
spreading of the ballad from Narva to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>The maid's sitting in a boat may come as well from the older
Esthonian as from the West Finnish version, although it is more
common in the latter for her to be sitting in the "little room."
The Russian as the kidnapper is a constant feature in the older
Esthonian version, but occurs also three times in the West
Finnish (once it is the red-headed Dane, in the copy in which the
oxen are preserved). Besides Russian, the kidnapper is once
called Karelian in West Ingria, often in East Finland, and this
denomination also occurs in Northeast Esthonia. The influence of
the older Esthonian versions is shown again in some copies
preserved in West Ingria which are not mixed up with the ballad
of the maid that has been sold; the mother having three aprons in
two instances, as in some Northeast Esthonian copies.</p>

<p>The river Neva as a local designation is preserved in East
Finland, and shows that the version in which it occurs migrated
from Ingria northwards. In the course of its migration (which
ends in Russian Karelia) this version has become mixed with the
West Finnish in multiform ways. The prelude of the East Finnish
has attached itself to the West Finnish, notwithstanding the
different metre. The trilogy of the latter has made its way into
the former, and has spoiled the measure. It is no doubt owing to
the influence of the Western version that, in North Ingria and
Karelia, the brother, more frequently the lover, has a war-sword,
the lover once a sea-ship, or the brother a red boat or
war-boat.</p>

<p>Finally it may be noted that in those West Ingrian copies in
which the ballads of the maid sold and the maid ransomed are
blended the ransomer is a son-in-law, and possesses "a willow
castle" (wooden strong-house?), the relation of which to the
castle in the West Finnish version is not clear.</p>

<p>If we denote the West Finnish versions by <b>a</b>, the 
older Esthonian by <b>b</b>, the ballad of the maid sold by 
her family by <b>c</b>, the status of the East-Finnish versions 
may be exhibited thus:</p>

<table>
<tr><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>In West Ingria,</td>
<td><b>b</b> + <b>c</b> + <b>a</b>.</td></tr>

<tr><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>

<tr><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>In Karelia,</td>
<td><b>b</b> + <b>c</b> + <b>a</b> + <b>a</b> + <b>a</b>.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>That is to say, there has been a constantly increasing
influence exerted by the West Finnish versions upon the East
Finnish Ingrian versions, and reciprocally. This circumstance has
caused it to be maintained that the East Finnish versions were
derived from the West Finnish, in spite of the difference of the
metre.</p>

Cornwall (sister of Mrs. Gibbons, from whom 78 <b>H</b> was

version of the tale, taught her by a Cornish nursery maid,
probably the same mentioned at the place last cited.</p>

<p>"A king had three daughters. He gave each a golden ball to
play with, which they were never to lose. The youngest lost hers,
and was to be hung on the gallows-tree if it were not found by a
day named. Gallows ready, all waiting to see the girl hung. She
sees her father coming, and cries:</p>

Poesia popolare pistoiese, p. 9, found a fragment of Scibilia

<p>The following copy was communicated by Mr. W.W. Newell, as
derived from Miss Emma M. Backus, North Carolina, who says: "This
is an old English song in the Yorkshire dialect, which was
brought over to Virginia before the Revolution. It has not been
written for generations, for none of the family have been able to
read or write." Miss Backus adds that the pronunciation indicated
is by no means that which is ordinarily used by the people who
sing this ballad. It will, however, be noted that the Yorkshire
dialect is not well preserved.</p>

<p>348 b. <b>German</b>. B&ouml;hme, in his edition of Erk's
Liederhort, I, 277, adds a copy, from singing, dated 1878, 'Die
Losgekaufte,' No 78 e.</p>

<p>349 f., 514 a, III, 516 b. A young man in prison bought out by
his sweetheart, father, mother, etc., refusing help: Little
Russian, Romanov, I, 63, No 2; Croatian, Valjavec, p. 303, No 19,
'Junak vu Madjarski vuzi;' Great Russian, Jakuskin, p. 147 f.;
Ruthenian, Kolberg, Pokucie, II, 226 f., Nos 418, 420. Woman
rescued by lover from Tatar who was about to kill her, the
blood-relations declining: Romanov, I, 53, No 105. 514 a. In
Nesselmann's Littauische Volkslieder, No 119, p. 96, and
Bartsch's Dainu Balsai, I, 147, No 107, II, 202, No 321 (from
Bezzenberger, Litauische Forschungen, p. 17, No 27), we have a
ballad of a youth who does not get release from confinement
though his blood relations lay down handsomely for him, but in
the end is freed by his sweetheart with a trifle of a ring or a
garland. In Bartsch, I, 63, No 53, a girl who has been shut up
nine years is let alone by her father and her brother, but
liberated by her lover; II, 296, Ulmann, Lettische Volkslieder,
p. 168, relations make an attempt to buy off a conscript, without
success, but his sweetheart effects his release by selling her
garland. Silly stories all.</p>
