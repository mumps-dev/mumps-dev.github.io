<h3>James Grant</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Motherwell's Manuscript, p. 470, communicated apparently by Buchan;
'The Gordons and the Grants,' Buchan's Ballads of the North of
Scotland, II, 220. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d19701.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>

<p>There was an implacable feud between the Grants of
Ballindalloch and the Grants of Carron, "for divers ages," Sir
Robert Gordon says, certainly for ninety years after 1550. This
fragment has to do with the later stage of their enmity. In 1628,
John Grant of Ballindalloch killed John Grant of Carron. James
Grant of Carron, uncle of the slain man, burnt all the corn,
barns, and byres of Ballindalloch young and old, and took to the
hills (1630). The Ballindallochs complained to Murray, the
lieutenant, and he, " to gar ane devil ding another," set the
Clanchattan upon James Grant. They laid siege to a house where he
was with a party of his men; he made his way out, was pursued,,
and was taken after receiving eleven arrow-wounds. When he was
well enough to travel, he was sent to Edinburgh, and, as
everybody supposed, to his death; but after a confinement of more
than a year he broke ward (October, 1632). Large sums were
offered for him, alive or dead; but James Grant was hard to keep
and hard to catch, and in November, 1633, he began to kythe again
in the north. A gang of the forbidden name of McGregor, who had
been brought into the country by Ballindalloch to act against
James Grant, beset him in a small house in Carron where he was
visiting his wife, having only his son and one other man with
him; but he defended him self with the spirit of another
Cloudesly, shot the captain, and got off to the bog with his
men.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d197_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"The year of God one thousand six hundred thirty-six, some of
the Marquis of Huntly's followers and servants did invade the
rebel James Grant and some of his associates, hard by Strathbogy.
They burnt the house wherein he was, but, the night being dark
and windy, he and bis brother, Robert Grant, escaped."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d197_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>This last escapade of James Grant may perhaps be the one to
which this fragment has reference, though Ballindalloch was not
personally engaged in the assault on the house, and I know of no
Douglas having sheltered Grant of Carron. One almost wonders that
this mettlesome and shifty outlaw was not celebrated in a string
of ballads.</p>

<p>Early in 1639, James Grant got his peace from the king; later
in the year, he joined the "barons" at Aberdeen with five hundred
men, and in 1640, we are told, "he purchased his remission
orderly and went home to his own country peaceably (against all
men's expectation, being such a blood-shedder and cruel
oppressor) after he had escaped so many dangers."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d197_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
