<p>'King Estmere' occurred at page 249 of Percy's folio
manuscript, but the three leaves on which it was written were
"unfortunately torn out" by Percy to send to the press, and the
genuine form of the ballad thereby put beyond recovery. In the
second and later editions of the Reliques the editor professes to
give the ballad from two copies ("containing very great
variations," 1794), one of them being that of the folio. But here
and elsewhere Percy employs a singular periphrasis, as he has
explained to us in the preface to the Reliques, and means only
that he has amended his original more or less. Notwithstanding
the seemingly explicit lauguage, there is no second copy at
all.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d060_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>We are told by Percy, in a note to stanza 63, that though
liberties have been taken with that portion of the ballad which
follows, yet wherever the fourth edition differs from the
preceding ones it has been brought nearer to the folio.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d060_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Some
notes of readings of the folio are also furnished in the fourth
edition (and are here restored), which were not given in the
others. While we cannot but be vexed that so distinguished a
ballad, not injured much, so far as we can see, by time, should
not come down to us as it came to Percy, our loss must not be
exaggerated. The changes made by the editor, numerous enough, no
doubt, cannot be very material until we approach the end. Stanzas
63-66 are entirely suspicious, and it may even be questioned
whether the manuscript contained a word that is in them.</p>

<p>The name of Bremor, son of the king of Spain, and "a heathen
hound" (if this be not Percy's interpolation), taken with certain
resemblances in the story, very naturally suggested to Professor
Sophus Bugge (Grundtvig, IV, 704) a connection between this
ballad and 'Young Orm and Bermer-Giant,' 'Orm Ungersvend og
Bermer-Rise.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d060_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The giant, who is described as a rabid
berserker, presents himself at the Danish court (Grundtvig,
<b>A</b>), and demands that the king shall give him his daughter
and half his land, or find a man who will fight in the ring with
him. The king refuses daughter and land, and says he will find a
champion. He offers the chance of winning so fair a may to his
men, and no one dares say a word except Young Orm, who sits
lowest at the board: he will be the man. But first Orm provides
himself with an irresistible sword, which is buried in his
father's tomb, and is yielded by the dead man only upon the
condition that his son shall take the revenge due for his death.
With this sword Orm, like the child in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_59.html">Sir Aldingar</a>,' cuts the
giant through at the knees, being, he says, not tall enough to
strike higher. He then goes to Iceland, and fights three days
with the men who had slain his father, but without prevailing. A
mermaid, from the sea-bottom, cries out to him that his sword is
under a spell, and that he must whirl it three times round his
head and then stick the point in the ground. This done, he has no
difficulty in despatching his foes. He returns to the Danish
court, and marries the princess.</p>

<p>The likeness between the English ballad and the Danish (which
represents well enough the other Norse poems) is that a youthful
champion wins a king's daughter by killing a truculent
competitor, who has nearly the same name in both (Bremor,
Bermer).</p>

<p>Further consideration led Bugge to maintain that the proper
subject of 'King Estmere' is rather the story of Hjalmar, Odd and
Anganty, and that the English ballad is better represented by the
tragic F&auml;r&ouml;e ballad of 'Arngrim's Sons' than by 'Orm
and Bermer-Giant,' which last he regards as a free reconstruction
of an earlier and fuller form of 'Arngrim's Sons' than has come
down to us. The points in which the story of Hjalmar, Odd and
Anganty<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d060_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> is like 'King Estmere,' in contrast with the Orm
ballad, are that the hero does not fight single-handed with the
giant, but has the help of Odd (Adler); that the king's daughter
chooses her husband for herself; that the bride is not won by a
sword taken from a father's grave. The argument is, however, much
too intricate and too long to be repeated here, even had the
subtle and accomplished advocate shown full confidence in the
conclusion.</p>

<p>But this confidence he does not feel, for, as he conceives,
King Estmere again exhibits resemblances to 'Ogier le Danois,'
the basis of the Danish ballad 'Holger Danske og Burmand,'
Grundtvig, No 30.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d060_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The name Adler, says Bugge, is about as
near to Ogier, Oddgeir, as to Oddr. Adler's brother, Estmere,
might be the chivalrous paynim Karaheus, despite the unlike name,
and King Adland's daughter the amiral's daughter Gloriande, the
beloved of Karaheus. Brunamons of Majorca, to whom the amiral
offers his daughter after the defection of Karaheus, may be
Bremer of Spain. Ogier, like Adler (in Percy's edition), kills
the hateful interloper, and Karaheus, like Estmere, gets the
lady, but without taking part in the fight. If this hypothesis is
not quite so satisfactory as the other, we may combine both. The
English ballad may have been derived from some form of 'Arngrim's
Sons,' but have been modified under the influence of 'Ogier le
Danois.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d060_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A brief statement of these speculations may suffice in view of
their inconclusiveness, which is the greater by reason of our not
knowing to what extent Percy interfered with his manuscript.</p>

<p>The names Adler and Estmere appear again in a short romance in
the Percy manuscript, Hales and Furnivall, II, 296. The story is
that of Hugdietrich in the Heldenbuch: von der Hagen, I, 169, ed.
1855, Amelung and J&auml;nicke, I, 167; given by Weber in
Illustrations of Northern Antiquities, p. 63. Adler is a king,
and, like Estmere in the ballad, is exacting in the matter of a
wife. In the Heldenbuch it is not the young man who is so
difficult to suit, but his guardian. Estmere (v. 11, where there
is corruption or defect) appears to be Adler's messenger to King
Ardine, the father of a lady who answers all requirements, and
who, as it turns out, likes Adler, but is not to be had on easy
terms.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d060_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>'King Estmere' begins very much like the Danish ballad, 'Den farlige
Jomfru,' Grundtvig, No 184, and especially like version 
<b>D</b>.</p>

<p>For knights and others to ride into hall, and up to the high
board, is quite according to use. Everyone will remember the
passage in Chaucer's Squire's Tale, vv 30 ff. So again in Sir

same, p. 227, lxxvi; Libius Disconius, Percy Manuscript, Hales

<p>The champion of England formerly rode into Westminster Hall in
the coronation ceremony, but this part of the spectacle was
omitted from the two last coronations.</p>

<p>King Estmere stables his steed at the hall board. Here again
the minstrel is within the bounds of custom. "On voyait au moyen
&acirc;ge, dans la salle des chefs gallois, d'&eacute;normes
crampons de fer, fix&eacute;s au pav&eacute; de distance en
distance, qui servaient aux chevaliers pour attacher leurs
chevaux, car ils y entraient souvent avec eux; quelques-uns les
conduisaient m&ecirc;me jusque dans leur chambre &agrave;
coucher:" Villemarqu&eacute;, Les Romans de la Table Ronde, etc.,
