<h3>59. Sir Aldingar</h3>

<p>This ballad, one of the most important of all that the Percy
manuscript has saved from oblivion, was first given to the world
in the Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (n, 48, ed. 1705; 11,
49, ed. 1707), with conjectural emendations by the editor, and
the insertion of some stanzas to complete the story. A second
version (<b>B</b>), very much humbled in diction, and otherwise
corrupted, but of indubitable antiquity, as Scott remarks, was
published in the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border in 1803. Tales
of the same general description as this ballad are extremely
often to be met with in ballad, romance, chronicle, or saga; nor
is the number small of those which have the special traits that
the accusation is made by a trusted officer of the husband, who
has attempted to seduce the lady, and has failed, and that the
wife is cleared by a judgment of God. Our ballad belongs with a
very distinct Scandinavian variety of these last, but has adopted
one characteristic trait from another source. The Scandinavian
ballad in question is 'Ravengaard og Memering,' (Grundtvig, No.
13), of which there are versions from Denmark, Iceland, and the
Faroes, as well as a Norwegian prose redaction.</p>

<p>A story essentially the same as that of the English and
Scandinavian ballads is told by William of Malmesbury (De Gestis
Regum Anglorum, ii, 12), of Gunhild, daughter of Cnut the Great
and Emma, who was married in 1036 to King Henry, afterwards the
Emperor Henry III. William was apparently following ballad
authority. Gunhild never had any trouble with her husband. The
story was probably transferred to her from St. Cunigund, the
consort of the Emperor St. Henry II, in whose legendary history
there is a passage essentially similar. A still earlier instance
is that of Gundeberg, wife of the Lombard king Arioald (about 630
A.D.).</p>

<p>The incident of the leper, which does not occur in 'Ravengaard
og Memering,' links the English ballad with the story of Oliva,
or Sibilla, in the Charlemagne cycle (see the Karlamagnus Saga,
Unger, p. 51; the old French <i>chanson de geste</i> of Doon
l'Alemanz, etc.). Compare also the Middle English romances Sir
Triamour and The Erl of Tolous (the latter professedly a "lay of
Britain"), and the old French romance of Joufrois.</p>
