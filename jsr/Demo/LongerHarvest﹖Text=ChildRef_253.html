<h3>Thomas o Yonderdale</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li><ol type="a">
<li>Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 221.</li>
<li>Christie's Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 96.</li>
</ol> <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d25301.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p><b>b</b> is epitomized from <b>a</b>, with a few variations,
mostly very trifling, as Christie had heard the ballad sung.</p>

<p>Thomas of Yonderdale gains Lady Maisry's love and has a son by
her. Overhearing some reproachful words one day as he passes her
bower, he is touched, and promises to marry her after returning
from a voyage, but while he is in a strange country wooes another
woman. He dreams that Maisry stands by his bed upbraiding him for
his inconstancy, and sends a boy to her to bring her to his
wedding. Maisry comes, arrayed, as she had been directed, in
noble style. The bride asks the boy who she may be, and is told
that she is Thomas's first love. Maisry asks Thomas why she was
sent for: she is to be his wife. The nominal bride asks his will:
she is to go home, with the comfort of being sent back in a
coach, whereas she came on a hired horse! This ill-used, but not
diffident, young woman proposes that Thomas shall give two thirds
of his lands to his brother and make him marry her. Thomas
refuses to divide his lands for any woman, and has no power over
his brother. According to b, the discarded bride asks only a
modest third of Thomas's lands for the brother; Thomas promises
to give a third to her, but disclaims, as in a, his competency to
arrange a marriage for his brother.</p>

<p>This looks like a recent piece, fabricated, with a certain
amount of cheap mortar, from recollections of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_62.html">Fair Annie</a>,' No
62, '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_73.html">Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</a>,' No 73, and '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_53.html">Young Beichan</a>,'
No
53.</p>
