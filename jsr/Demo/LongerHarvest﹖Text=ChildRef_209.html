<p>"Of this," says Motherwell, "many variations exist among
reciters," and his remark is borne out by what is here given.</p>

<p>The copy in Cunningham's Songs of Scotland, II, 186, is A
retouched, with st. 5 dropped and two stanzas (<b>L</b>) inserted
from recitation. The texts of Christie, <b>I</b>, 52, 84, are
<b>J</b> abridged and <b>E</b> <b>b</b>. Of <b>J</b> Christie
says that he heard in 1848 a version sung by a native of Buchan,
Aberdeenshire, who had it through her grandmother and
great-grandmother, which differed only in being more condensed
and wanting the catastrophe, and in having Badenoch's lady for
Bignet's, and Keith-Hall and Gartly for Black Riggs and
Kincraigie.</p>

<p>Geordie Gordon, <b>A</b>, of Gight (Gigh), <b>B</b> <b>b</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>I</b>, of the Bog o Gight, <b>H</b>, is in
prison, on a charge endangering his life. He sends a message to
his wife to come to Edinburgh. She rides thither with the utmost
haste, and finds Geordie in extremity. She is told that his life
may be redeemed by the payment of a large sum of money. She
raises a contribution on the spot, pays the ransom, and rides off
with her husband.</p>

<p>Kinloch and others incline to take Geordie to be George
Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly, who incurred the Queen Regent's
displeasure for failing to execute a commission against a
Highland robber in 1554. Huntly was committed to Edinburgh
Castle, and some of his many enemies urged that he should be
banished to France, others that he should be put to death. The
Earl of Cassilis, though a foe to Huntly, resisted these measures
on grounds of patriotism, and proposed that he should be deprived
of certain honors and offices and fined. A fine was exacted, and
the places which had been taken from him were restored.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d209_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> With
regard to this hypothesis, it may at least be said that, if it
should be accepted, the ballad would be quite as faithful to
history as many others.</p>

<p><b>A</b>-<b>B</b> are the purer forms of the ballad; 
<b>F</b>-<b>J</b> are corrupted by admixture.</p>

<p>Geordie is Geordie Lukely of Stirling in <b>F</b>. In
<b>G</b>, he is the Earl of Cassilis, 'of Hye,' as if some singer
of the Gordons had turned the tables on Huntly's enemy. In
<b>H</b>, Geordie lives at the Bog o Gight, and should be the
Earl, or Marquis, of Huntly; but writers of peerages will consult
st. 17.</p>

<p>There has been a battle in the North in <b>A</b>-<b>B</b>. Sir
Charles Hay<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d209_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> has been killed, and Geordie is in custody for
this, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. Geordie has killed a man and is to die,
<b>C</b>; the man is his wife's brother, <b>D</b>. In <b>E</b>,
Geordie is a rebel.</p>

<p><b>F</b> begins with two stanzas from a vulgar
last-dying-speech, of which more by and by: otherwise the story
is not essentially injured, though the style is lowered. Geordie
(in the first two stanzas) has done many an ill deed, but no
murder or slaughter; he has stolen fifteen of the king's horse
and sold them in Bohemia. Earl Cassilis, likewise, in <b>G</b>,
could not keep his hand off horses; he has stolen three geldings
out of a park and sold them to Balleny (Balveny). Huntly, if it
be he, in <b>H</b>, has only made free with the king's deer. In
<b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, Geordie has had an intrigue with Bignet's
(Pilbagnet's, Badenoch's) lady, for which the husband has thrown
him into prison, and he is to die. But he owns to more than this
in <b>J</b>. Beginning with an acknowledgment of one of the
king's best steeds stolen and sold in 'Bevany,' upon being
pressed, he confesses to a woman abused and five orphan babes
killed for their money.</p>

<p>Geordie points his message to his wife in <b>C</b> 2, <b>D</b>
4, by begging her to sew him or bring him his linen shirt
(shirts), a good side shirt, which will be the last he shall
need, and a lang side sark is equally prominent in the lady's
thoughts in <b>I</b> 8.</p>

<p>The lady stops for nothing in her ride to Edinburgh. She will
not, and does not, eat or drink all the way, <b>A</b> 4, 5. When
she comes to the water-side, finding no boat ready, she swims the
Queen's Ferry, <b>B</b> 7, <b>C</b> 5, <b>D</b> 9, <b>J</b> 13,
<b>L</b> 1; or pays a boatman prodigally to take her over,
<b>H</b> 9, <b>I</b> 9, <b>J</b> 14.</p>

<p>When the lady gaes oer the pier of Leith, comes to Edinburgh,
to the West Port, the Canongate, the Parliament Close, the
tolbooth-stair, the prison-door, she deals out crowns and
ducatoons, makes the handfus o red gold fly, among the numerous
poor, and bids them pray for Geordie. She has the prudence, in
<b>G</b> 5, to do the same among the nobles many at the
tolbooth-gate, that they may plead for Geordie.</p>

<p>The block and axe are in sight, and Geordie, in chains, is
coming down the stair, <b>A</b>; the napkin is laid over his
face, and the gallows is making ready, <b>B</b> (so <b>F</b>, but
put further on), his head is to go, <b>C</b>; the rest of the
nobles sit (stand) hat on head, but hat in hand stands Geordie,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>L</b>.</p>

<p>The lady makes a plea for her husband's life. She is the
mother of many children (the tale ranges from six to eleven) and
is going with yet another, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>N</b>. She would bear them all over again for the life of
Geordie, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, or see them all streekit before her
eyes, <b>B</b>; and for his life she will part with all that she
owns, <b>A</b> 10, <b>B</b> 11, 16, <b>D</b> 14.</p>

<p>The king in A is moved by neither of these appeals. The number
of her children is so far from affecting him that he orders the
heading-man to make haste. But the Gordons collect and pass the
word to be ready. There would have been bloody bouks upon the
green.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d209_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The lady is told that by paying a good round sum, 5,000 (500)
pounds, 10,000 (1000) crowns, she can redeem Geordie's life. An
aged lord prompts the king to offer these terms in <b>A</b>; in
the other versions, they are proposed directly; by the king
himself, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>; by the queen, <b>B</b>,
<b>I</b>; by the good Argyle, <b>D</b>; by an English lord,
<b>H</b>. The bystanders contribute handsomely; she pays the
ransom down, and wins the life of Geordie, <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>,
<b>G</b>-<b>J</b>.</p>

<p>In <b>E</b>, which is a mere fragment, there is no fine or
collection: a bold baron says, such true lovers shall not be
parted, and she gets her Geordie forthwith. In <b>F</b>, no
contribution is required, because the lady, after scattering the
red gold among the poor, is still in a condition to produce the
five thousand pound from her own pocket. For this she receives a
'remit,' with which she hies to the gallows and stops the
impending execution. In <b>I</b> <b>b</b>, which is defective,
the money collected is to pay the jailer's fee. After the
discharge has been secured (in two or three copies earlier), Lord
Corstorph, <b>B</b> <b>a</b>, the Laird o Logie, <b>B</b>
<b>b</b>, an Irish lord, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, an English lord,
<b>D</b>, the gleid Argyle, <b>I</b>, Lord Montague, <b>J</b>,
expresses a wish that Geordie's head were off, because he might
have succeeded to the lady. The lady checks this aspiration,
sometimes in very abusive language.</p>

<p>The pair now ride off together, and when she is set in her
saddle, no bird in bush or on briar ever sang so sweet as she,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>. If we
were to trust some of those who recite her story, the lady who
has shown so much spirit and devotion was not one of those who
blush to find good deeds fame. 'Gar print me ballants that I am a
worthy lady,' <b>B</b> 30 makes her say; 'Hae me to some writer's
house, that I may write down Gight's lament and how I borrowed
Geordie,' <b>I</b> <b>a</b> 25; 'Call for one of the best clerks,
that he may write all this I've done for Geordie,' <b>J</b> 36.
What she really did say is perhaps faithfully given in <b>D</b>
18: 'Where is there a writer's house, that I may write to the
north that I have won the life of Geordie?'</p>

<p><b>I</b> and <b>J</b> are probably from stall-prints, and it
has not been thought necessary to notice some things which may
have been put into these to eke them out to a convenient length.
<b>J</b> has an entirely spurious supplement. When the pair are
riding away, and even as the wife is protesting her affection,
Geordie turns round and says, A finger of Bignet's lady's hand is
worth a' your fair body. A dispute ensues, and Geordie pulls out
a dagger and stabs his lady; he then takes to flight, and never
is found. Another set, mentioned by Motherwell, makes Geordie
drown his deliverer in the sea, in a fit of jealousy (Minstrelsy,
p. lxxvi, 46).</p>

<p>There is an English broadside ballad, on the death of "George
Stoole" which seemed to Motherwell "evidently imitated from the
Scottish song." This was printed by H. Gosson, whose time is put
at 1607-41.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d209_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This ballad was to be sung "to a delicate
Scottish tune;" Georgy comes in as a rhyme at the end of stanzas
not seldom; Georgy writes to his lady, bewailing his folly; he
never stole no oxe nor cow, nor ever murdered any, but fifty
horse he did receive of a merchant's man of Gory, for which he
was condemned to die, and did die. These are the data for
determining the question of imitation.</p>

<p>There is a later 'Georgy' ballad, of the same general cast, on
the life and death of "George of Oxford," a professed and
confessed highwayman, a broadside printed in the last quarter of
the seventeenth century. In this, Lady Gray hastens to Newcastle
to beg Georgy's life of the judge, and offers gold and land to
save him, after the fashion of Lady Ward in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_191.html">Hughie Graham</a>;' to
no purpose, as in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_191.html">Hughie Graham</a>.' This Georgy owns and boasts
himself a thief, but with limitations much the same as those
which are made a point of by the other; he never stole horse,
mare, or cloven-foot, with one exception the king's white steeds,
which he sold to Bohemia.</p>

<p>Both of these ballads are given in an appendix.</p>

<p>Whether the writers of these English ballads knew of the
Scottish 'Geordie,' I would not undertake to affirm or deny; it
is clear that some far-back reciter of the Scottish ballad had
knowledge of the later English broadside. The English ballads,
however, are mere "goodnigbts." The Scottish ballads have a
proper story, with a beginning, middle, and end, and (save one
late copy), a good end, and they are most certainly original and
substantially independent of the English. The Scottish Geordie is
no thief, nor even a Johnie Armstrong. There are certain passages
in certain versions which give that impression, it is true, but
these are incongruous with the story, and have been adopted from
some copy of the broadside, the later rather than the earlier.
These are, the first two stanzas of P, utterly out of place,
where we have the king's horses stolen and sold in Bohemia,
almost exactly as in the ballad of 'George of Oxford,' 15;
<b>G</b> 7, where the Earl of Cassilis is made to steal geldings
and sell them in Balleny; and <b>J</b> 23, in which the Laird of
Gight steals one of the king's steeds (precisely as in 'George of
Oxford') and sells it in Bevany. That is to say, we have the very
familiar case of the introduction (generally accidental and often
infelicitous) of a portion of one ballad into another; which, if
accidental in the present instance, would easily be accounted for
by a George being the hero in each. Further; the burden of
<b>B</b>, embodied in the ballad in two versions, <b>I</b> 27,
<b>J</b> 35, has a general resemblance to that of 'George
Stoole,' and could hardly have been original with the Scottish
ballad. There was probably a 'Geordie Luklie,' a Scottish variety
of one of the English broadsides.</p>
