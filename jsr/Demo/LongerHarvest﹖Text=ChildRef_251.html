<h3>Lang Johnny More</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Lang Johnny Moir,' Buchan's Ballads of
the North of Scotland, I, 248. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d25101.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>'Lang Johnny More,' Christie's Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 44,
is epitomized from Buchan, "with a few alterations from the way
the editor has heard it sung." The variations are absolutely of
no account, as in other cases in which, Christie has used this
phrase.</p>

<p>Johnny More, a youth fourteen feet tall and three yards round
the waist, goes to London to bear the king's banner. He falls in
love with the king's daughter, and she with him, and the king
locks the lady up in her chamber and swears that he will hang the
Scot. Johnny laughs at the hanging; but the English give him
laudanum, and when he wakes he finds his jaws and hands in iron
bands and his feet in fetters. He sends a boy with a letter
asking his uncle to come to his aid, and to bring with him Jock o
Noth. These champions, 'twa grizly ghosts to see,' have three
feet between their brows and three yards between their shoulders.
Coming to London they find the gates locked, because, as they
learn from a keeper, a Scot is to be hanged that morn. The keeper
declining to open the gates, Jock o Noth drives in three yards of
the wall with his foot. Johnny More is standing with the rope
round his neck, ready to be turned off. Though the portentous
pair have a giant's strength, they are quite too superior to use
it like a giant; they tell Johnny that there is no help for him
if he has been guilty of a heinous crime. Learning that his only
crime is loving a gay lady, they require that his sword shall be
given back to him, then go before the king and demand the lady;
they have come to her wedding. Take her, says the king. I never
thought to see such men. Jock of Noth could have brought a man
thrice three times bigger, if he had supposed that his own size
would cause such astonishment. Any way, says the craven king, the
boy that took the message shall be hanged. In that case, replies
Jock, we shall attend the burial and see that you get your
reward. The king yields everything. Johnny More calls for a
priest to join him and his love; the king for a clerk to seal the
tocher. Johnny is rich, and spurns tocher. Auld Johnny More,
Young Johnny More, Jock o Noth and the boy go off with the
lady.</p>

<p>This ballad has been referred to under No 99, II, 378, as
perhaps an imitation, and in fact almost a parody, of 'Johnie
Scot.' In No 99 John is the little Scot; here he is the muckle
Scot, stanza 6 (Gaelic mor = big), and his helpmates, as well as
he, are of gigantic size. Excepting in this and one other
particular, the stories are materially the same. In both Johnie
goes to England to bear the king's banner; a love-affair ensues
between him and the king's daughter; the king puts his daughter
into confinement, and threatens to hang Johnie, but in the end is
constrained to give him his daughter; Johnie calls for a priest
to marry him and the princess, the king calls for a clerk to
arrange the tocher; Johnie refuses tocher, and goes off with his
love or bride.</p>

<p>In No 99 Johnie, who has escaped, comes to the rescue of the
princess with a redoubtable force; in this ballad Johnie is made
prisoner, and sends for his uncle and another giant to come to
his help. Their monstrous dimensions make them, for
ballad-purposes, fairly equivalent to the five hundred men who
accompany Johnie in No 99.</p>

<p>Some versions of No 99, as already remarked, have borrowed
features from this ballad. Auld Johnie and Jock o Noth are
presented here, stanza 21, as twa grizly ghosts to see, and their
brows are three feet apart, their shoulders three yards; and so
with the champion in <b>A</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, of No 99.</p>

<p>Quite curiously, the hero of the Breton ballad which resembles
'Johnie Scot' is described as a giant (we must suppose on
traditionary authority) in the title of two copies.</p>

<p>Auchindoir and Rhynie (parishes) are in the west of
Aberdeenshire, north of the Don. Noth is a considerable hill in
the latter.</p>
