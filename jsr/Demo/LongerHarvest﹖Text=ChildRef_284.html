<h3>John Dory</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Ravenscroft's Deuteromelia, London, 1609; No 1 of
Freemen's Songs, sig. B. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d28401.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>John Dory goes to Paris and offers King John, in return for a
pardon asked for himself and his men, to bring the French king
all the churls in England in bonds. Nicholl, a Cornish man, fits
out a good bark, has an encounter with John Dory, and after a
smart fight takes him prisoner.</p>

<p>This ballad had a remarkable popularity in the seventeenth
century, as is evinced by the numerous cases of its being cited
which Chappell has collected, Popular Music, p. 67 f.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d284_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>As to the history of the transactions set forth in the ballad,
I am not aware that anything has been added to the account given
by Carew in his Survey of Cornwall, 1602, p. 135, which Ritson
has quoted in the second edition of his Ancient Songs, II, 57, an
account which is likely to have been taken from the ballad, with
the specification from tradition that Nicholl was "son to a widow
near Foy."</p>

<p>"Moreover, the prowess of one Nicholas, son to a widow near
Foy, is descanted upon in an old three-man's song, namely, how he
fought bravely at sea with John Dory (a Genowey, as I
conjecture), set forth by John, the French king, and, after much
bloodshed on both sides, took, and slew him, in revenge of the
great ravine and cruelty which he had fore committed upon the
Englishmen's goods and bodies." (Page 316 of the edition of
1813.)</p>

<p>The king in the ballad would be John II, the Good, who was
taken prisoner at Poitiers, and died in 1364. No John Doria is
mentioned as being in his service.</p>
