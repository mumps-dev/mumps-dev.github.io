<p>The broadside, <b>A</b> <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, is found in many
other collections: Pepys, III, 145, No 143; Crawford, No 94, etc.
(see Ebsworth). <b>B</b>, the Scottish ballad (an improvement on
the English), is without doubt derived from print, but not
directly from <b>A</b> <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>. In <b>B</b> the maid
feigns to be afraid of her master, as in <b>A</b> <b>c</b>, not
of her father. From Halliwell's Notices of Fugitive Tracts, p.
37, No 49, Percy Society, vol. xxix, we learn that The Royal
Garland of Protestant Delight, London, 1689, has a ballad with
the title 'The witty lass of Somersetshire, or the fryer servd in
his kind,' with an "answer," in the last stanza of which 'the
inn-keeper, her master,' laughs at the fryer's disaster.</p>

<p>The tune of 'The Friar in the Well' occurs in The Dancing
Master, from 1650 to 1686: Chappell's Popular Music, p. 274.
Munday, in his 'Downfall of Robert, Earl of Huntington,' Act iv,
Scene 2, 1598, refers to the 'merry jest ... how the friar fell
into the well, for love of Jenny, that fair bonny belle.' A
reference of Skelton's in his Colyn Cloute<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d276_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> carries the
story, and almost certainly the ballad, back to the first quarter
of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The copy in Kinloch's Ballad Book, p. 25, was compounded by
the editor from <b>B</b> <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>.</p>

<p>A maid, solicited by a friar, says that she</p>

<p>fears hell-fire; the friar reminds her that if she were in
hell he could sing her out. She stipulates for money in advance;
while the friar is gone to fetch some, she hangs (spreads) a
cloth before (over) a well. The money in hand, she calls out that
her father (master) is coming; the friar runs to hide behind the
cloth (a screen), and falls into the well. The friar cries for
help; he is left to sing himself out. Extricated after a
sufficient cooling, he asks his money back, but is told that he
must pay for fouling the water.</p>

<p>This story, one might safely say, is not beyond the "imaginary
forces" of any Western people, but an open well inside of an
English house is at least of unusual occurrence, and if we find
something of the kind to our hand in an Eastern tale of similar
character, a borrowing seems more plausible than an invention.
There is a considerable class of tales, mostly Oriental, in which
a chaste wife discomfits two or three would-be seducers, bringing
them to shame and ridicule in the end. In some, she exacts or
receives money from her suitors at the outset; in some, an
allegation that her husband is coming is the pretext for her
concealing them. An example in English is 'The Wright's Chaste
Wife,' by Adam of Cobsam, edited for the Early English Text
Society, in 1865, by Dr. Furnivall. In this, three men
successively are tumbled through a trap door into an underground
room. But in the Persian T&uacute;t&iacute; N&aacute;ma, or Book
of the Parrot, of Nakhshab&iacute;, the wife lays a bed over a
dry well, her suitors are invited to sit on it, and they fall in;
and here, it is not extravagant to suppose, we may have the
remote source of the trick in our ballad.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d276_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>There is a French ballad of the same general type: 'Le
lourdaud moine,' Tarb&eacute;", Romancero de Champagne, II, 135;
'Le moine Nicolas,' Bujeaud, II, 284. A monk, enamored of a
married woman, is appointed to come to her while her husband is
away; he is told to lay off his frock, which she secures, and she
takes money which he has brought. He is then sent to the door to
see if the husband be coming, and is locked out. He asks to have
his frock and money returned; she will keep them for her husband.
The convent jeer at him when he comes back: 'Dieu b&eacute;nisse
la comm&egrave;re qui t'a jou&eacute; ce tour-l&agrave;!'</p>

<p>'Munken i Vaande,' a rather flat Danish ballad from a
Manuscript of the 16th century, tells of a monk who knocks at the
door of a woman whom he has been courting, and calls to her to
keep her word; she tells her husband to slip under the bed, and
lets the monk in; the monk hands the woman gold rings which he
had promised; the goodman comes out and gives him a beating; the
monk leaps out of the window and goes to his cloister; his
superior asks why he has been away; he has been shriving the
farmer's wife, and it has nearly cost him his life.</p>
