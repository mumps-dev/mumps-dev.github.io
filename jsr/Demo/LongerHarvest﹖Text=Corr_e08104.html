<p>The following copy was kindly communicated to me by Mr. David
MacRitchie, Honorary Secretary of the Gypsy Lore Society, in
advance of its publication in the Journal of the society. While
it preserves the framework of the story, it differs very
considerably in details from all the printed copies. It is
evidently of the same origin as some of the Scottish versions
(all of which seem to derive from print), though it has no marked
resemblance to the actual form of any particular one of these.
Some peculiarities are plausibly attributable to dim or imperfect
recollection. Thus, the ball-play of <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, etc., is
turned into a ball. Lord Barnard is made a king, and the page the
king's brother (neither of which -changes is an improvement). We
may observe that in <b>J</b> Lord Barnabas is at the king's
court, and in <b>I</b> Sir Grove is Lord Bengwill's brother; but
these points are not decisive, and the changes may be purely
arbitrary. 4 shows traces of <b>E</b> 5 and <b>F</b> 3; 8 may
have been suggested by something like <b>G</b> 4; and the last
line of 14 looks like a corruption of <b>G</b> 29. This involves
the supposition that the source of the ballad was a version
somewhat different from any hitherto recovered; but 'Little
Musgrave' is one of the best known of all ballads, and the
variants must have been innumerable. On the whole, 1-8, 14,
present a free treatment of ill-remembered matter; 9-13 are
fairly well preserved; compare <b>E</b> 13-17.</p>

<h3>O</h3>

<p>'Moss Groves,' taken down in 1891 by Mr. John Sampson,
Liverpool, from Philip Murray, an old tinker, who learned the
ballad in his boyhood from an old gypsy named Amos Rice.</p>
