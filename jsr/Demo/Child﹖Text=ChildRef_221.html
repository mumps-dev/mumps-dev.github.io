<p>The ballad was first published by Sir Walter Scott, under the
title 'The Laird of Laminton,' in the first edition of the
Minstrelsy, 1802, 1, 216. , This copy was fashioned by the editor
from two in Herd's Manuscripts, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. In later
editions of the Minstrelsy (III, 122, 1833), the ballad was
given, with the title Katharine Janfarie, "in a more perfect
state, from several recited copies." Twelve stanzas out of
twenty-one, however, are repeated from the first edition. Much
the larger part of what is not in Herd is taken from <b>C</b>;
the name Lochinvar is adopted from <b>D</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d221_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A few peculiar
readings may be from copies now not known, or may be the
editor's.</p>

<p>The ballad in Christie, II, 16, is Scott's later copy, with
the omission of the 16th stanza. That in Nimmo's Songs and
Ballads of Clydesdale, p. 141, is <b>J</b>, from Motherwell's
Minstrelsy.</p>

<p>A Scots laird wooes a Scots maid and wins her favor. An
English laird or lord, very liberal as to gowd and gear, comes to
court the same lass, gains the consent of her friends (who had at
least made no opposition to the earlier suit), and sets the
wedding-day. The first lover comes to the wedding, backed by a
strong body of armed men, whom he keeps out of sight. He is asked
why he has come; it is for a sight of the bride or a word with
her, or to take a glass of wine with her or the bridegroom, and
this had he will go away. Getting near the bride on this
pretence, he swings her on to his horse and is off. A bloody
fight follows, but the bride is not retrieved. Englishmen may
take warning by this not to seek wives in Scotland; it will
always end in their being tricked and balked: The attitude of the
young woman to her first lover is not distinctly brought out in
several copies. That she had jilted him in favor of a wealthier
Englishman would probably not lessen the Scot's pleasure in
carrying her off. In <b>B</b> 18, she does not go willingly; she
greets and wrings her hands, and says it 's foul play.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d221_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In
<b>F</b> 2, <b>G</b> 2, the first lover openly charges her with
changing and foul play, and such is the implication in <b>E</b>
13. In <b>B</b> 14, the bride, seeing the bloodshed, exclaims,
Wae's me for foul play! and her lover replies, Wae to your wilful
will for causing so much good blood to be spilt! from which we
must infer a fault on her part. <b>I</b> 2 has the ambiguous line
'and his love drew away,' which cannot be interpreted to mean
that the first lover was inconstant without flying in the face of
all the other copies. <b>D</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, unequivocally
represent the lass as faithful to her first love. The bridegroom,
in these versions, arranges the match with the family, arid does
not mention the matter to the lass until the wedding-day: so in
<b>C</b>, <b>H</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d221_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> She sends word to her lover that if he
will come for her she will go with him, <b>D</b>; writes 'to let
him understand,' <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, and not to pay him the cold
compliment of an invitation to see her wed the man that has
supplanted him, as in <b>B</b> 3, <b>E</b> 5, <b>F</b> 5,
<b>I</b> 3.</p>

<p>In <b>E</b> 7-9, while the first lover is drinking with his
comrades they incite him to carry off the bride on her
wedding-day; so <b>G</b> 6, without explanation of the
circumstances. In <b>E</b> 7-9, 12-15, he goes to the
bridal-house, and sitting at a table vents words which the other
guests cannot understand: there was a young man who loved a lass
that to-day goes another man's bride, and plays her old love foul
play; had <i>he</i> been so served, he would take the bride away.
Upon this the English ask if he wishes a fight. There is
something of this in <b>B</b> 7-10, <b>F</b> 13, 14, <b>G</b>
11-14.</p>

<p>The lover would wish to keep the strong body of men that he
had brought with him quite in the background until their cue
came. When, therefore, in <b>I</b> 8, 9, the bridegroom's friends
ask him what was that troop of younkers they had seen, he puts
them off with the phrase, It must have been the Fairy Court; so
in <b>L</b>. In <b>B</b> 5, 6 (where a stanza, and more, has
dropped out), when the bridegroom sees this troop from a high
window, the bride (from incredulity, it must be, and not because
she is in concert with her old lover) says he must have seen the
Fairy Court. <b>G</b> 15, 16, where the phrase comes in again,
seems to have suffered corruption; any way, the passage is not
quite intelligible to me.</p>

<p>Katharine Jaffray (Jamphray, Janfarie) is the lass's name in
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>-<b>G</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>; Katharine
Johnstone<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d221_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in <b>J</b>; in <b>B</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>,
she is nameless.</p>

<p>The lover is Lochinvar in <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b> (note); Lamington in <b>D</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>J</b>; Lauderdale in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>; he has no
name in <b>B</b>. The bridegroom is Lochinvar in <b>D</b>,
<b>H</b>; Lamington in <b>B</b>, Lymington, <b>K</b>; Lauderdale
in <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>; Lochinton <b>A</b>, Lamendall <b>E</b>,
Limberdale <b>I</b> (obvious mixtures of the preceding);
Faughanwood in <b>C</b>; in <b>J</b> he has no name. The
bridegroom should be an Englishman, but Lochinvar, Lamington, and
Lauderdale are all south-Scottish names. <b>B</b> puts a Scot
from the North Country in place of the titular Englishman of the
other copies, but this Norland man is laird of Lamington.</p>

<p>The place of the fight is Cadan bank and Cadan brae, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>; Cowden bank (banks) and Cowden brae (braes), <b>A</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>J</b>, the variation being perhaps due to the very
familiar Cowdenknows; Callien, Caylin, Caley bank (buss) and
brae, in <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>F</b>; Foudlin dyke and Foudlin
stane in <b>K</b>. No place is named in <b>B</b>, <b>G</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d221_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
In <b>I</b>, the lass lives in Bordershellin.</p>

<p>A copy from the recitation of a young Irishwoman living in
Taunton, Massachusetts (learned from print, I suppose, and in
parts imperfectly remembered), puts the scene of the story at
Edenborough town. A squire of high degree had courted a comely
country girl. When her father came to hear of this, he was an
angry man, and "requested of his daughter dear to suit his
company," or to match within her degree. The only son of a farmer
in the east had courted this girl until he thought he had won
her, and had got the consent of her father and mother. The girl
writes the squire a letter to tell him that she is to be married
to the farmer's son. He writes in answer that she must dress in
green at her wedding (a color which no Scots girl would wear, for
ill luck), and he will wear a suit of the same, and wed her 'in
spite of all that's there.' He mounts eight squire-men on
milk-white steeds, and rides 'to the wedding-house, with the
company dressed in green.' (See the note to <b>L</b>.)</p>

<p>Scott's Lochinvar, in the fifth canto of Marmion, was modelled
on 'Katharine Jaffray.'</p>

<p>Another ballad (but a much later and inferior) in which a
lover carries off a bride on her wedding-day is '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_254.html">Lord William</a>,'
otherwise 'Lord Lundy,' to be given further on.</p>
