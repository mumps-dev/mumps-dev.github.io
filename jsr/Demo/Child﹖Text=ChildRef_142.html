<p><b>B</b> is also in the Roxburghe collection, III, 10.</p>

<p><b>B</b> <b>a</b> is printed in Ritson's Robin Hood, 1795, II,
128. Evans, Old Ballads, 1777, 1784, I, 196 follows the Aldermary
garland.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Little John, meaning to go a begging, induces an old
mendicant to change clothes with him and to give him some hints
how to conduct himself. Thus prepared he attempts to attach
himself to three palmers, who, however, do not covet his company.
One of the palmers gives John a whack on the head. We may
conjecture, from the course of the story in <b>B</b>, that John
serves them all accordingly, and takes from them so much money
that, if he had kept on in this way, he might, as he says, have
bought churches.</p>

<p>The beginning of <b>A</b> is very like that of Robin Hood
rescuing Three Squires, <b>A</b>; but the disguise is for a
different object. We are reminded again of Hind Horn, and
particularly of versions <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, in which
the beggar, after change of clothes, is asked for
instructions.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. John is deputed by Robin to go a begging, and asks
to be provided with staff, coat, and bags. He joins four sham
beggars, one of whom takes him a knock on the crown. John makes
the dumb to speak and the halt to run, and bangs them against the
wall, then gets from one's cloak three hundred pound, and from
another's bag three hundred and three, which he thinks is doing
well enough to warrant his return to Sherwood.</p>

<p><b>B</b> is translated by Anastasius Gr&uuml;n, p. 155.</p>
