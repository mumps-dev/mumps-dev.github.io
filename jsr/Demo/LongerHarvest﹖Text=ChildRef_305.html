one, apparently of considerable antiquity, which was found among
the papers of the late Mrs. Cockburn of Edinburgh." Scott made
occasional use of Herd's Manuscript and of Glenriddell's,
inserted some stanzas which he had received from Sheriff Plummer,
and in the second edition (otherwise slightly altered) two
stanzas from the recitation of Mungo Park. Mrs. Cockburn's

far as the latter goes. I much regret that exertions made to

circumstances, in which reference is made to Lord Philiphaugh (a

1702."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d305_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The original manuscript, unfortunately and

<b>d</b>, the copy actually preserved among the Philiphaugh
papers, is evinced by a watermark to be not older than 1848. It
shows variations from Aytoun's printed text which cannot be other
than wilful alterations.</p>

<p><b>B</b>, which is both defective, corrupted, and chargeable
with flat repetition, and <b>C</b>, a few fragmentary verses, are
all that have been retrieved from tradition, although Scott says
that the ballad "has been for ages a popular song in
Selkirkshire."</p>

<p>A manuscript copy was understood to be in possession of the
late Mr. George Wilson, S.S.C., Edinburgh, but, as in the case of
the original of the Philiphaugh Manuscript and in that of Mrs.
Cockburn's copy, inquiry and search were fruitless.</p>

<p>The king of Scotland is informed that there is an Outlaw in
Ettrick Forest who makes no account of him; the king vows that he
will be king of Ettrick Forest, or the Outlaw shall be king of
Scotland. Earl Hamilton advises that an envoy be sent to the
Outlaw to ascertain whether he is willing to do homage to the
king and hold the forest of him; if the Outlaw should refuse,
then they will proceed to extremities with him. The king sends
Boyd, Earl of Arran, to announce his terms: the Outlaw is to do
homage; otherwise he and his lands will be subjugated, his castle
levelled, his wife made a widow, and his men be hanged. The
messenger demands of the Outlaw, in the king's name, of whom he
holds his lands; the Outlaw replies that the lands are his own,
won by himself from the Southron, and that he recognizes no king
in Christendom. The messenger intimates that it will nevertheless
be necessary for the Outlaw to do homage to the king of Scotland,
under the penalties before mentioned. Many of the king's nobles
shall lie cold first, he replies. Boyd reports to his master that
the Outlaw claims to hold the forest by his own right, which he
will maintain against all kings in Christendom; the king prepares
to enforce his sovereignty with five thousand men.</p>

<p>The Outlaw vows that the king shall pay dear for his coming,
and sends for succor to three of his kinsmen, all of whom promise
help. As the king approaches the forest, Hamilton ventures to
give further advice: that the Outlaw should be summoned to come
with four of his best men to meet the king and five earls; fire,
sword, and forfeiture to follow upon refusal. The Outlaw bethinks
himself of his children, and complies. He and his company fall on
their knees and implore the king's mercy; his mercy shall be the
gallows, says the king. The Outlaw protests again that he won his
lands from the enemy, and as he won them so will he keep them,
against all kings in Christendom; but having indulged in this
vaunt asks mercy again, and offers to give up the keys of his
castle if the king will constitute him and his successors
sheriffs of the forest. The king, on his part, is equally ready
for a compromise. The Outlaw, on surrendering the keys of his
castle, shall be made sheriff of Ettrick Forest, and shall never
be forfeited as long as he continues loyal, and his men shall
have pardon if they amend their lives. After all the strong
language on both sides, the Outlaw has only to name his lands
(but gives a very imperfect list), and the king (waiving complete
particulars) renders him whatever he is pleased to claim, and
makes him sheriff of Ettrick Forest while upwards grows the
tree.</p>

<p>So far all the copies of <b>A</b> concur, as to the story,
except that <b>c</b> 22, 33, by an absurd corruption, makes the
Outlaw to have won his lands, not from the Soudron, the
Soudronie, but from Soldan Turk, the Soldanie; in which respect
<b>A</b> <b>c</b> is followed by <b>B</b> 26, <b>C</b> 3, 5.

<p><b>B</b> represents that the king, after appointing a meeting
with the Outlaw 'in number not above two or three,' comes with a
company of three hundred, which violation of the mutual
understanding naturally leads the Outlaw to expect treachery. The
king, however, not only proceeds in good faith, but, without any
stipulations, at once makes the Outlaw laird of the Forest.</p>

<p>From the note, otherwise of no value, which accompanies the
Philiphaugh Manuscript, it is clear that the ballad was known
before 1700; how much earlier it is to be put we can neither
ascertain nor safely conjecture, but we may say that there is
nothing in the language of the piece as it stands which obliges
us to assign it a much higher antiquity.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d305_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>As to James Murray, laird of Traquair, whose lands the king
had gifted lang syne, <b>A</b> 45<sup>3</sup>, 48<sup>1</sup>,
Sheriff Plummer remarks in Herd's Manuscript: "Willielmus de
Moravia had forfeited the lands of 'trakware' ante annum 1464. As
of that date I have a charter of these lands, proceeding upon his
forfeiture, granted Willielmo Douglas de Cluny." Thomas Boyd was
created Earl of Arran after his marriage with the eldest sister
of James III, 1467. The Earl of Hamilton is mentioned <b>A</b>
7<sup>1</sup>, 50<sup>1</sup>. Sheriff Plummer observes that
there was an earl of that surname till 1503.</p>

<p>Scott, in his preface in the Border Minstrelsy, after
professing himself unable to ascertain the foundation of the
tale, goes on to state the following historical possibilities:</p>

<p>"This ballad ... commemorates a transaction supposed to have
taken place betwixt a Scottish monarch and an ancestor of the
ancient family of Murray of Philiphaugh in Selkirkshire. ... It
is certain that during the civil wars betwixt Bruce and Baliol
the family of Philiphaugh existed and was powerful, for their
ancestor, Archibald de Moravia, subscribes the oath of fealty to
Edward I, A.D. 1296. It is therefore not unlikely that, residing
in a wild and frontier country, they may have, at one period or
other during these commotions, refused allegiance to the feeble
monarch of the day, and thus extorted from him some grant of
territory or jurisdiction. It is also certain that, by a charter
from James IV, dated November 30, 1509, John Murray of
Philiphaugh is vested with the dignity of heritable Sheriff of
Ettrick Forest, an office held by his descendants till the final
abolition of such jurisdictions by 28th George II, cap. 23. But
it seems difficult to believe that the circumstances mentioned in
the ballad could occur under the reign of so vigorous a monarch
as James IV. It is true that the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>
introduced seem to refer to the end of the fifteenth or beginning
of the sixteenth century; but from this it can only be argued
that the author himself lived soon after that period. It may
therefore be supposed (unless further evidence can be produced
tending to invalidate the conclusion) that the bard, willing to
pay his court to the family, has connected his grant of the
sheriffship by James IV with some former dispute betwixt the
Murrays of Philiphaugh and their sovereign, occurring either
while they were engaged upon the side of Baliol, or in the
subsequent reigns of David II and Robert II and III, when the
English possessed great part of the Scottish frontier, and the
rest was in so lawless a state as hardly to acknowledge any
superior.</p>

<p>"At the same time, this reasoning is not absolutely
conclusive. James IV had particular reasons for desiring that
Ettrick Forest, which actually formed part of the jointure-lands
of Margaret, his queen, should be kept in a state of
tranquillity: Rymer, vol. xiii, p. 66. In order to accomplish
this object, it was natural for him, according to the policy of
his predecessors, to invest one great family with the power of
keeping order among the rest. It is even probable that the
Philiphaugh family may have had claims upon part of the lordship
of Ettrick Forest, which lay intermingled with their own
extensive possessions, and in the course of arranging, not,
indeed, the feudal superiority, but the property of these lands,
a dispute may have arisen of sufficient importance to be the
groundwork of a ballad.</p>

<p>"It is farther probable that the Murrays, like other Border
clans, were in a very lawless state, and held their lands merely
by occupancy, without any feudal right. Indeed, the lands of the
various proprietors in Ettrick Forest (being a royal demesne)
were held by the possessors, not in property, but as the kindly
tenants, or rentallers, of the crown. ... This state of
possession naturally led to a confusion of rights and claims. The
kings of Scotland were often reduced to the humiliating necessity
of compromising such matters with their rebellious subjects, and
James himself even entered into a sort of league with Johnnie
Faa, the king of the gypsies. Perhaps, therefore, the tradition
handed down in this way may have had more foundation than it
would at present be proper positively to assert."</p>

<p>In the way of comment upon these surmises of Scott, which
proceed mainly upon what we do not know, it may be alleged that
we have a fairly good record of the relations of Selkirkshire to
the Scottish crown during the fourteenth century, when this
district was so often changing hands between the English and the
Scotch, and that there is no indication of any Murray having been
concerned in winning it from the Southron, as is pretended in the
ballad, either then or at any time, so that this part of the
story may be set down as pure invention.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d305_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Hardly less
fictitious seems to be the dispute between the Scottish king and
a Murray, in relation to the tenure. The Murrays first became
connected with Selkirkshire in 1461. John de Moravia then
acquired the lands of Philiphaugh, and was afterwards appointed
Gustos of Newark Castle, and came into possession of Hangingshaw
and Lewinshope. All of these are attributed to the Outlaw in the
ballad. This John Murray was a contemporary of Boyd, Earl of
Arran, and of the forfeited Murray of Traquair, but, with all
this, nobody has pitched upon him for the Outlaw; and it would
not have been a happy idea, for he was on perfectly good terms,
and even in great favor, with the court under James III. His
grandson, John Murray, was in equal or greater favor with James
IV, and was made hereditary Sheriff of Selkirk in 1509, and for
this last reason has been proposed for the Outlaw, though "
nothing could be more improbable than that this orderly,
'circumspect,' and law-enforcing officer of the crown should ever
take up an attitude of rebellious defiance so diametrically
opposed to all we really know of his character and
conduct."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d305_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Scott thought that light might be thrown upon the history of
the ballad by the Philiphaugh family papers. Mr. Craig-Brown gave
them the accurate examination which Scott suggested, and came to
the same conclusion as Aytoun, that the story told in the ballad
is, if not altogether fictitious, at least greatly exaggerated.
He is inclined to think that "some clue to the date of the ballad
lies in the minstrel's animus against the house of Buccleuch"
(shown only in <b>A</b> <b>b</b>). "James Murray, tenth laird,"
he says, "is the last mentioned in the family Manuscripts as
possessor of Newark, which castle passed into the hands of
Buceleuch either in his lifetime or that of his successor,
Patrick Murray. After the death of James IV at Flodden, the
Queen-Regent complained loudly of Buccleuch's encroachment upon
her dowry lands of Ettrick Forest, the Gustos of which domain had
Newark for a residence. Buceleuch continued to keep his hold,
and, as he could only do so by displacing Murray, the ill-will of
the latter family was a natural consequence. By way of showing
the earlier and superior title of the Murrays, the ballad-writer
has either invented the story in toto, or has amplified the
tradition of an actual visit paid to a former Murray by the king.
Both Sir Walter Scott and the compiler of the Family Records are
of opinion that John Murray, eighth laird, is the presumptive
Outlaw of the song; and, as he was undoubtedly in great favor
with King James IV, nothing is more likely than that the young
monarch may have ended one of his hunting-expeditions to the
Forest by confirming John in his hereditary sheriffship,
interrupted for a few years by the appointment of Lord Home. As a
matter of fact, John Murray did in 1509 obtain a royal charter
from his sovereign, of the sheriffship; but, as the office had
been vacant since 1506, there is Hothing improbable in the
supposition that he had already claimed the family rights and
taken possession of the castle. Indeed, in 1503, he acted as
sheriff at the queen's infeftment in her dowry-lands of Ettrick
Forest. It would have been in thorough keeping with all that is
known of James IV if his Majesty had taken the opportunity to
give his favorite a half-jesting reproof for his presumption; but
that Murray was ever seriously outlawed is out of the question.
His king heaped honors on him; and only eighty years after his
death his descendant obtained a feudal precept of his lands for
gratuitous services rendered to the crown by his family, '
without default at any time in their due obedience as became
faithful subjects.' So that, granted a royal progress to Newark,
followed by Murray's investiture with the sheriffship, the poet
remains chargeable with considerable embellishment. A
glorification of the family of Philiphaugh and a sneer at the
rapacity of Buceleuch are the evident motives of his
rhyme."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d305_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"The tradition of Ettrick Forest," says Scott, Minstrelsy, 2d
ed., 1803, I, 4, "bears that the Outlaw was a man of prodigious
strength, possessing a batton or club with which he laid lee (i.
e. waste) the country for many miles round, and that he was at
length slain by Buceleuch or some of his clan."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d305_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This
account is not in keeping with the conception of the Outlaw given
by the ballad, but indicates the ferocious robber and murderer,
the Cacus of popular story, of whom no doubt the world was
actually once very guilty, and of whom there are many specimens
in British tradition as elsewhere.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d305_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> As such he seems to turn
up again in Galloway, where he haunts a forest of
Kirkcudbrightshire, called the Black Morrow wood, from which he
sallies out "in the neighboring country at night, committing
horrible outrages." Of this personage, Mactaggart, in his
Gallovidian Encyclopedia, p. 73, says:</p>

<p>"Tradition has him a Blackimore, ... but my opinion is that he
was no Blackimore; he never saw Africa; his name must have been
Murray, and as he must have been, too, an outlaw and a bloody
man, gloomy with foul crimes,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d305_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Black prefaced it, as it did
Black Douglass, and that of others; so he became Black Murray."
And he adds that this pest was disposed of by the people pouring
a barrel of spirits into a spring one night when he was out on
his rambles, whereof drinking the next day, he was made drunk and
fell asleep, in which condition his foes dirked him; or according
to others, one of the McLellans of Kirkcudbright took to the wood
single-handed, found the outlaw sleeping, and drove a dirk
through his head, whence the head on the dagger in the McLellans'
coat of arms.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d305_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>2. The castle, says Scott, is supposed by the common people to
have been the castle of Newark; but "this is highly improbable,
because Newark was always a royal fortress." The only important
point, however, would seem to be who was the keeper of the
castle. The Douglasses are spoken of as holding it from about
1326 to 1455; John de Moravia was Gustos after 1462. The Outlaw's
five hundred men are shooting on Newark lee in <b>A</b> <b>b</b>
18<sup>4</sup>, and Newark lee is twice mentioned elsewhere in
that copy. Sheriff Plummer in his letter to Herd says: This I
take to be the castle of New-wark, on the west end of which are
the arms of Scotland supported by two unicorns. But in Scott's
preface we are told that Sheriff Plummer has assured the editor
that he remembered the insignia of the unicorns, etc., so often
mentioned in the ballad, in existence upon the old tower at
Hangingshaw. Whether the etc. covers the picture of the knight
and the lady bright, and Sheriff Plummer had therefore changed
his opinion, does not appear.</p>

<p>15<sup>3</sup>. "Birkendale brae, now commonly called
Birkendailly [see <b>C</b> 2<sup>1</sup>], is a steep descent at
the south side of Minchmoor, which separates Tweed-dale from the
Forest, at the top of which you come first in sight of New-wark
Castle." Plummer's letter to Herd.</p>

<p>19. Mr. MacRitchie, II, 141 ff., considers that the Lincoln
green dresses of the Outlaw's men, and perhaps the purple of the
Outlaw and his wife, show that they were "gypsies," not perhaps
of a swarthy color, but still people "living a certain archaic
'heathen' life," at any rate a "wild and lawless life," and
"refusing to follow the course of civilization." This inference
from the costume seems to be not quite necessary, unless, or even
if, all outlaws are "gypsies." Robin Hood, in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_145.html">Robin Hood and Queen Katherine</a>,'
is dressed in scarlet red, and his men in
Lincoln green (III, 199, 201). But green is the regular attire
for men who shoot with the bow, III, 76 f., 91. Johnie Cock, when
going out to ding the dun deer down, puts on Lincoln green, III,
3 ff. Will Stewart, even, when only going to a ball-match,
clothes his men in green, and himself in scarlet red, II, 434,
437.</p>

<p>51. "Penman's core, generally called Perman's core
[Permanscore in Scott, ed. 1833], is a nick or hollow on the top
of a high ridge of hills a little to the east of Minchmoor."
Plummer, as before. In B 50, poor man's house; 52, poor man's
score.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d305_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
