<p>Roxburghe, II, 392, III, 284; Douce, III, 115 b, by L. How, of
the eighteenth century. A manuscript copy in the British Museum,
Add. 15072, fol. 59, is a, with omission of
12<sup>2</sup>-15<sup>4</sup>, and a few errors of
carelessness.</p>

<p>Printed in Ritson's Robin Hood from <b>c</b> and one of the
Roxburghe broadsides. Evans, Old Ballads, 1777, 1784, I, 136,
seems to have followed the Aldermary garland, with slight
deviation.</p>

<p>Robin Hood, walking in the forest, finds a shepherd lying on
the ground, and bids him rise and show what he has in his bottle
and bag. The shepherd tells him that he shall not see a drop of
his bottle until his valor has been tried. Robin stakes twenty
pound on the issue of a fight, and the shepherd his bag and
bottle. They fight from ten to four, hook against sword. Robin
Hood falls to the ground, and the shepherd calls on him to own
himself beaten. Robin demands the boon of three blasts on his
horn. These bring Little John, who undertakes the shepherd, and
is so roughly handled that Robin is fain to yield his wager, to
which Little John heartily agrees.</p>

<p>It is but the natural course of exaggeration that the
shepherd, having beaten Robin Hood, should beat Little John. This
is descending low enough, but we do not see the bottom of this
kind of balladry here.</p>

<p>In King Alfred and the Shepherd, Old Ballads, 1723, I, 43,
stanzas 6-17, the king plays Robin's part, fighting four hours
with the Shepherd and then craving a truce. Further on Alfred
blows his horn. There are also verbal agreements.</p>
