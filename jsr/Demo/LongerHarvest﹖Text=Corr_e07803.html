the parish of Cury, Cornwall. After the last stanza followed "a
stormy kind of duet between the maiden and her lover's ghost, who

shadows." Hunt, Popular Romances of the West of England, First

<p>Little-Russian tale, Trudy, II, 416, No 122. A girl who is
inconsolable for the death of her mother is advised to hide
herself in the church after vespers on Thursday of the first week
in Lent, and does so. At midnight the bells ring, and a dead
priest performs the service for a congregation all of whom are
dead. Among them is the girl's godmother, who bids her begone
before her mother remarks her. But the mother has already seen
her daughter, and calls out, You here too? Weep no more for me.
My coffin and my grave are filled with your tears; wretched it is
to bathe in them! (W.W.) After this the mother's behavior is not
quite what we should expect. Cf. the tale in Gasp&eacute;, just
cited.</p>
