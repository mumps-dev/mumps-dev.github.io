<h3>Flodden Field</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>From Deloney's Pleasant History of John Winchcomb, 
in his younger yeares called Jacke of Newberie, etc., 
London, 1633; reprinted by J.O. Halliwell, London, 
1859, p. 48. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d16801.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Printed in Ritson's Ancient Songs, 1790, p. 115; Evans's Old
Ballads, 1810, III, 55.</p>

<p>A booke called Jack of Newbery was entered to Thomas
Millington, March 7, 1597: Arber, Stationers' Registers, III, 81.
The edition of 1633, the earliest which Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps
had met with, was the ninth, published by Cuthbert Wright. The
author has introduced several pieces of verse into his tale, two
of them popular ballads, '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_9.html">The Fair Flower of Northumberland</a>' and
this of Flodden, of which Deloney says, "in disgrace of the
Scots, and in remembrance of the famous atchieved historie, the
commons of England made this song, which to this day is not
forgotten of many:" p. 47.</p>

<p>King James has made a vow to be in London on St. James's day.
Queen Margaret begs him to keep faith with her brother Henry, and
reminds him that England is hard to win; for which James says she
shall die. Lord Thomas Howard, the queen's chamberlain, comes to
the defence of his mistress, but the king in his rage declares
that he shall be hanged and she burned as soon as he comes back.
But James never came back; he was slain at Bramstone Green with
twelve thousand of his men.</p>

<p>1, 2. St. James's day is selected, as being the king's. King
James's letter to King Henry is dated the 26th of July, the day
following St. James's day, and the Scottish herald delivered it
in France, and announced war to the king of England, in
consequence of the unsatisfactory answer, on the 12th of August,
or shortly before.</p>

<p>3-5. Queen Margaret's remonstrance is historical. James, says
Lindsay, would "give no credence to no counsel, sign nor token
that made against his purpose, but refused all godly counsel
which was for the weal of his crown and country; neither would he
use any counsel of his wise and prudent wife, Margaret, queen of
Scotland, for no prayer nor supplication that she could make
him... She assured him, if he past in England at that time, that
he would get battle. Yet this wise and loving counsel could not
be taken in good part by him, because she was the king of
England's sister." Cronicles, 1814, p. 267 f.</p>

<p>6. The Earl of Surrey, uncle by marriage to Margaret Tudor,
had the charge of escorting her to Scotland in 1503, and this is
ground enough for the ballad's making him her chamberlain ten
years later.</p>

<p>8. "This battle was called the Field of Flodden by the
Scotsmen and Brankston [Bramstone] by the Englishmen, because it
was stricken on the hills of Flodden beside a town called
Brankston; and was stricken the ninth day of September, 1513."
Lesley, History, 1830, p. 96.</p>

<p>10. Hall says that the English slew "twelve thousand, at the
least, of the best gentlemen and flower of Scotland." The gazette
of the battle (Pinkerton's History, II, 457), Polydore Vergil,
and modern Scottish historians, say ten thousand. Among these
were twelve earls, thirteen lords, and many other persons of high
rank.</p>

<p>12. 'lack with a feather' is said in contempt of the Scottish
king's levity or foolhardiness. "Then was the body bowelled,
embawmed and cered:" Hall, p. 564, ed. 1809. "His body was
bowelled, rebowelled, and enclosed in lead," "lapped in lead:"
Stowe, Chronicle, p. 494 b, ed. 1631; Survey, Book III, p. 81 a,
ed. 1710. Fair Rosamond's bones, when they were exhumed at
Godstow, says Leland, were closed in lead and within that closed
in leather: Dugdale's Monasticon, ed. 1823, IV, 365, No VIII.</p>

<p>In the letter sent to Henry VIII in France James included the
slaughter of Andrew Barton among the unredressed grievances of
which he had to complain. A few days before the battle of
Flodden, Lord Thomas Howard, then admiral, used the occasion of
his father's dispatching a herald to the King of Scots to say
that "inasmuch as the said king had divers and many times caused
the said lord to be called at days of true to make redress for
Andrew Barton, a pirate of the sea long before that vanquished by
the same Lord Admiral, he was now come, in his own proper person,
to be in the vanguard of the field, to justify the death of the
said Andrew against him and all his people, and would see what
could be laid to his charge the said day:" Hall's Chronicle, ed.
1809, p. 558.</p>

<p>There is a slight resemblance in one or two particulars, such
as might be expected from similarity of circumstances, between
this ballad and '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_159.html">Durham Field</a>.' In the latter the King of Scots
swears that he will hold his parliament in leeve London, st. 6. A
squire warns him that there are bold yeomen in England; the king
is angry, draws his sword, and kills the squire, 7-9. In 'Scotish
Ffeilde,' Percy Folio, Hales and Furnivall, I, 217,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d168_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> the
French king says there is nothing left in England save millers
and mass-priests, v. 109; and in the poem on Flodden, reprinted
by Weber, and recently by Federer,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d168_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Lord Home makes this same
assertion, Weber, p. 10, 187-92; Federer, p. 8, sts 46, 47. Cf.
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_159.html">Durham Field</a>,' p. 282.</p>

<p>The forged manuscript formerly in the possession of J. Payne
Collier, containing thirty ballads alleged to be of the early
part of the seventeenth century, has for the second piece in the
volume a transcript of this ballad, with variations.</p>

<p>The battle of Flodden called out a great deal of verse. The
most notable pieces are two already referred to, and a third
which will be given here in an appendix; the less important will
be found in Weber's volume.</p>
