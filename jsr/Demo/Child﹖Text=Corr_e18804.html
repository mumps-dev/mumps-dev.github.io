<h3>188. Archie o Cawfield</h3>


<p>P. 484. <b>B</b> <b>b</b> was first printed in the second edition 
of the Minstrelsy, 1803, I, 195.</p>

<p>The following is the copy from which Scott derived the stanzas
introduced into this later edition of the ballad. It will be
observed that 'luve of Teviotdale' is the reading of
4<sup>2</sup>, and not a correction of Scott's, as suggested at
486 b.</p>

<p>'Archie o Ca'field, Variations,' "Scotch Ballads, Materials
for Border Minstrelsy," No 90, Abbotsford; in the handwriting of
John Leyden.</p>
