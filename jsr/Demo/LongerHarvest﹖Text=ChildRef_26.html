<h3>The Three Ravens</h3>

</ol>

<p><b>a</b> was printed from Melismata, by Ritson, in his Ancient
Songs, 1790, p. 155. Mr. Chappell remarked, about 1855, Popular
Music of the Olden Time, I, 59, that this ballad was still so
popular in some parts of the country that he had "been favored
with a variety of copies of it, written down from memory, and all
differing in some respects, both as to words and tune, but with
sufficient resemblance to prove a similar origin." Mother ell,
Minstrelsy, Introduction, p. lxxvii, note 49, says he had met
with several copies almost the same as <b>a</b>. <b>b</b> is the
first stanza of one of these (traditional) versions, "very
popular in Scotland."</p>

<p>The following verses, first printed in the Minstrelsy of the
Scottish Border, and known in several versions in Scotland, are
treated by Motherwell and others as a traditionary form of 'The
Three Ravens.' They are, however, as Scott says, "rather a
counterpart than a copy of the other," and sound something like a
cynical variation of the tender little English ballad. Dr.
Rimbault (Notes and Queries, Ser. v, in, 518) speaks of unprinted
copies taken down by Mr. Blaikie and by Mr. Thomas Lyle of
Airth.</p>
