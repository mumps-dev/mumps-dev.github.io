<h3>90. Jellon Grame</h3>


<p>P. 303 b, 513 b, III, 515 b, IV, 479 b. Precocious 
growth.</p>

<p>The French romance of Alexander. Alb&eacute;ric de
Besan&ccedil;on: Alexander had more strength when three days old
than other children of four months; he walked and ran better from
his first year than any other child from its seventh. (The same,
nearly, in Lamprecht, vv. 142-4: he throve better in three days
than any other child of three months; 178-80, in his first year
his strength and body waxed more than another's in three.)
Manuscript de l'Arsenal: the child grew in vitality and knowledge
more in seven years than others do in a hundred. Manuscript de
Venise: he grew more in body and knowledge in eight years than
others in a hundred. P. Meyer, Alexandre le Grand, I, 5, v. 56
f., 6, v. 74 f., 27, v. 39 f., 240, v. 53 f. 'Plus sot en x jors
que i. autres en c:' Michelant, p. 8, v. 20. A similar precocity
is recorded of the Chinese Emperor Schimong: G&uuml;tzlaff,
Geschichte der Chinesen, hrsgg. v. Neumann, S. 19, cited by
Weismann, Lamprecht's Alexander, I, 432.</p>

<p>In the romance of M&eacute;lusine it is related how, after her
disappearance in serpent-form, she was seen by the nurses to
return at night and care for her two infant sons, who, according
to the earliest version, the prose of Jehan d'Arras, grew more in
a week than other children in a month: ed. Brunet, 1854, p. 361.
The same in the French romance, I. 4347 f., the English metrical
version, I. 4035-37, and in the German Volksbuch. (H.L.
Koopman.)</p>

<p>Tom Hickathrift "was in length, when he was but ten years of
age, about eight foot, and in thickness five foot, and his hand
was like unto a shoulder of mutton, and in all parts from top to
toe he was like a monster." The History of Thomas Hickathrift,
ed. by G.L. Gomme, Villon Society, 1885, p. 2. (G.L.K.)</p>

<p>Vol'ga, Volch, of the Russian <i>bylinas</i>, must have a high
place among the precocious heroes. When he was an hour and a half
old his voice was like thunder, and at five years of age he made
the earth tremble under his tread. At seven he had learned all
cunning and wisdom, and all the languages. Dobrynya is also to be
mentioned. See Wollner, Volksepik der Grossrussen, pp. 47 f.,
91.</p>

<p>Simon the Foundling in the fine Servian heroic song of that
name, Karadzic, II, 63, No 14, Talvj, I, 71, when he is a year
old is like other children of three; when he is twelve like
others of twenty, and wonderfully learned, with no occasion to be
afraid of any scholar, not even the abbot. (Cf. 'The Lord of
Lorne,' V, 54, 9, 10.)</p>
