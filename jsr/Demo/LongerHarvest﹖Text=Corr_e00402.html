<h3>4. Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight</h3>

<p>P. 24. May Colvin in Ireland. According to a Connemara story
given briefly in Once a Week, II, 53 f, July 2, 1864, one Captain
Webb was wont to ill-use young women, and then strip them and
throw them into the Murthering Hole, not far from Maarn. At last
a girl induced him to turn his back, and then thrust him into the
Hole. P. Z. Round.</p>

<p>24 b. The Flemish ballad is given by F&eacute;tis, Histoire
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la Musique, V, 59, "d'apr&egrave;s un
texte ancien qui a deux strophes de plus que celui de Willems."
G.L.K.</p>

<p>28 b. '&Aacute;su kv&aelig;&eth;i' in &Iacute;slenzk
fornkv&aelig;&eth;i, II, 226, No 60, <b>A</b>-<b>M</b>: this copy
<b>D</b> (<b>E</b>-<b>M</b>). Published in 1885.</p>

<p>41, and p. 487 f. Russian form, corrupted.</p>

<p>On the oaken bridge stood Galya, there Galya stood and drew
water, she drew water and spoke with Marko. "O Marko mine, what
dost thou say to me? Come wander with me, youth; let us wander on
foot through the dark night." One field traversed, a second they
crossed, and in the third lay down on the grass to sleep. The
rain began to sprinkle, the fierce rain to fall, and Marko began
to slumber. "O Marko mine, sleep not while with me; bare your
sword and fight with me." Young Galya vanquished Marko; she
conquered Marko, and rode, she mounted and rode over the level
field. Galya arrives at the new gate; there stands Marko's
mother, more beautiful than gold. "Young Galya, what can I say?
Have you seen Marko near my house?" "Oh, hush, mother; weep not,
mourn not. Thy Marko has married in the field; he has taken to
himself a fine young lady, a grave in the meadow." Trudy, V, 425,
No 816.</p>

<p>A man beguiles a girl with tales of a land where the rivers
are of honey, where pears grow on willows, and maidens are
clothed in gold. Trudy, V, 335, No 660.</p>

<p>In one version of this ballad a cuckoo flies up and bids the
maid not listen to the Cossack's tales: "I have flown all over
the world, and I have never seen golden mountains, nor eaten
pears from willow-trees, nor beheld maidens clad in gold."</p>

<p>41 a, and 487 a. A maid going to the ford for water meets
Marko, and suggests that he should propose for her; if her mother
will not consent, they will roam. They cross one field and two,
and lie down on the grass in a third. He is falling asleep, when
she wakes him with a cry that they are pursued. Marko is
overtaken and his head cut off. Trudy, V, 226, No 454. No 548, p.
278, is nearly the same. No 690, p. 352, resembles in part No
454, and partly Golovatsky, I, 116.</p>

<p>42 a and 488 a, <b>A</b>. A lover takes his love by her white hands,
leads her to the Danube, seizes her by the white sides, and
flings her in. She asks whether she is ugly, or whether it is her
ill fate. Trudy, V, 166, No 339.</p>

<p>In Po&eacute;sies pop. de la France, Manuscript, VI, 278,
Po&eacute;sies pop. de la Correze, a ballad called 'Chanson du
brave Altizar' is mentioned as a variant of 'Dion et la Fille du
Roi,' and, fol. 321 of the same volume, a version from Mortain,
Basse Normandie, is said to have been communicated, which,
however, I have not found. These may both belong with the French
ballads at II, 356.</p>

<p>43 a. <b>E</b>. Another copy in Guillon, Chansons pop. de
l'Ain, p. 85.</p>

<p>Add <b>I</b>: 'Monsieur de Savigna,' Decombe, Chansons pop.
d'Ille-et-Vilaine, p. 264, No 92. The ballad begins like
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, but the conclusion is inverted. The fair one
is thrown into a pond; M. Savigna cuts away with his sword the
plant she seizes when she comes up from the bottom the fourth
time; she asks, If you ever go back, where will you say you left
me? and he answers, In the big wood full of robbers.</p>

<p>59. <b>F</b>. In the catalogue of the British Museum, "London?
1710?"</p>

<hr/>

<p>486 a, <b>CC</b>, first line, and 504 a, 219b, fifth line.
<i>Read</i> Schlossar.</p>

<p>487, note. The scene between St. George and the maiden is
woven into a Greek tale, 'Der Gold&auml;pfelbaum und die
Hollenfahrt,' Hahn, No 70, II, 55. See, also, George's legend in
Bezsonof, Kalyeki Perekhozhie, I, 506, 509, 520, Nos 117, 118,
120.</p>
