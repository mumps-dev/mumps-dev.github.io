<li>Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 24;
Motherwell's Manuscript, p. 570. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d04401.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>A base-born cousin of a pretty ballad known over all Southern
Europe, and elsewhere, and in especially graceful forms in
France.</p>

<p>The French ballad generally begins with a young man's
announcing that he has won a mistress, and intends to pay her a
visit on Sunday, or to give her an <i>aubade</i>. She declines
his visit, or his music. To avoid him she will turn, e.g., into a
rose; then he will turn bee, and kiss her. She will turn quail; he
sportsman, and bag her. She will turn carp; he angler, and catch
her. She will turn hare; and he hound. She will turn nun;
<a name="Page_I_400"/>
he
priest, and confess her day and night. She will fall sick; he
will watch with her, or be her doctor. She will become a star; he
a cloud, and muffle her. She will die; he will turn earth, into
which they will put her, or St. Peter, and receive her into
Paradise. In the end she says, Since you are inevitable, you may
as well have me as another; or more complaisantly, Je me donnerai
&agrave; toi, puisque tu m'aimes tant.</p>

<p>This ballad might probably be found anywhere in France, but
most of the known versions are from south of the Loire. <b>A</b>.

<p><b>Roumanian</b>. 'Cucul si Turturica,' Alecsandri,
Poesi&#277; populare ale Rom&acirc;nilor, p. 7, No 3; French
version, by the same, Ballades et Chants populaires, p. 35, No 7;
Schuller, Rom&auml;nische Volkslieder, p. 47. The cuckoo, or the
lover under that style, asks the dove to be his mistress till
Sunday. The dove, for his sake, would not say No, but because of
his mother, who is a witch, if not let alone will change in to a
roll, and hide under the ashes. Then he will turn into a shovel,
and get her out. She will turn into a reed, and hide in the pond.
He will come as shepherd to find a reed for a flute, put her to
his lips and cover her with kisses. She will change to an image,
and hide in the depths of the church. He will come every day in
the week, as deacon or chorister, to kiss the images (a pious
usage in those parts), and she will not thus escape him. Schuller
refers to another version, in Schuster's unprinted collection, in
which youth and maid carry on this contest in their proper
persons, and not under figure.</p>

<p><b>Ladin</b>. Flugi, Die Volkslieder des Engadin, p. 83, No
12. "Who is the younker that goes a-field ere dawn? Who is his
love?" "A maid all too fair, with dowry small enough," "Maid,
wilt give me a rose?" "No; my father has forbidden." "Wilt be my
love?" "Rather a seed, and hide in the earth." " Then I will be a
bird, and pick thee out," etc.</p>

<p>Greek. Tommaseo, III, 61, Passow, p. 431, No 574a. A girl
tells her mother she will kill herself rather than accept the
Turk: she will turn swallow, and take to the woods. The mother
replies, Turn what you will, he will turn hunter, and take you
from me. The same kernel of this ballad of transformations in
Comparetti, Saggi dei Dialetti greci dell' Italia meridionale, p.
38, No 36, as M. Paul Meyer has remarked, Revue Critique, II,
302.</p>

<p>The ballad is well known to the Slavic nations.</p>

<p><b>Moravian</b>. &#268;elakovsky, p. 75, No 6, Wenzig,
Slawische Volkslieder, p. 72, Bibliothek slavischer Poesien, p.
92. A youth threatens to carry off a maid for his wife. She will
fly to the wood as a dove. He has a rifle that will bring her
down. She will jump into the
<a name="Page_I_401"/>
water as  a fish. He has a net that
will take the fish.  She will turn to a hare; he to a dog; she
cannot escape him.</p>

<p><b>Polish</b>. Very common. <b>A</b> <b>a</b>. Wac&#322;aw z
Oleska, p. 417, No 287; Konopka., p. 124. A young man says,
though he should ride night and day for it, ride his horse's eyes
out, the maid must be his. She will turn to a bird, and take to
the thicket. But carpenters have axes which can fell a wood. Then
she will be a fish, and take to the water. But fishermen have
nets which will find her. Then she will become a wild duck, and
swim on the lake. Sportsmen have rifles to shoot ducks. Then she
will be a star in the sky, and give light to the people. He has a
feeling for the poor, and will bring the star down to the earth
by his prayers. "I see," she says, "it 's God's ordinance;
whithersoever I betake myself, you are up with me; I will be
yours after all." Nearly the same mutations in other versions,
with some variety of introduction and arrangement. <b>A</b>

<p><b>Servian</b>. Karadshitch, I, 434, No 602; Talvj, II, 100;
Kapper, II, 208; Pellegrini, p.37. Rather than be her lover's,
the maid will turn into a gold-jug in a drinking-house; he will
be mine host. She will change into a cup in a coffee-house; he
will be <i>cafetier</i>. She will become a quail, he a sportsman;
a fish, he a net. Pellegrini has still another form, 'La
fanciulla assediata,' p. 93. An old man desires a maid. She will
rather turn into a lamb; he will turn into a wolf. She will
become a quail; he a hawk. She will change into a rose; he into a
goat, and tear off the rose from the tree.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that these ballads are derived, or
take their hint, from popular tales, in which (1) a youth and
maid, pursued by a sorcerer, fiend, giant, ogre, are transformed
by the magical powers of one or the other into such shapes as
enable them to elude, and finally to escape, apprehension; or (2)
a young fellow, who has been apprenticed to a sorcerer, fiend,
etc., and has acquired the black art by surreptitious reading in
his master's books, being pursued, as before, assumes a variety
of forms, and his master others, adapted to the destruction of
his intended victim, until the tables are turned by the
fugitive's taking on the stronger figure and despatching his
adversary.</p>

K&ouml;hler adds several examples of one kind or the other in a
note to Koadalan, Revue Celtique, I, 132, and Wollner Slavic
parallels in a note to Leskien und Brugman, Litauische
Volkslieder und M&auml;rchen, p. 537 f.</p>

<p>The usual course of events in these last is that the prentice
takes refuge in one of many pomegranate kernels, barley-corns,
poppy-seeds, millet-grains, pearls; the master becomes a cock,
hen, sparrow, and picks up all of these but one, which turns into
a fox, dog, weasel, crow, cat, hawk, vulture, that kills the
bird.</p>

<p>The same story occurs in the Turkish Forty Viziers, Behrnauer,
p. 195 ff, the last transformations being millet, cock, man, who
tears off the cock's head. Also in the introduction to
Siddhi-K&uuml;r, J&uuml;lg, pp 1-3, where there are seven masters
instead of one, and the final changes are worms, instead of seeds,
seven hens, a man with a cane who kills the hens.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d044_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The pomegranate and cock (found in Straparola) are among the
metamorphoses in the contest between the afrite and the princess
in the tale of the Second Calender in the Arabian Nights.</p>

<p>Entirely similar is the pursuit of Gwion the pigmy by the
goddess Koridgwen, cited by Villemarqu&eacute;, Barzaz Breiz, p.
lvi, ed. 1867, from the Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales, I, 17.
Gwion having, by an accident, come to the knowledge of superhuman
mysteries, Koridgwen wishes to take his life. He flees and turns
successively into a hare, fish, bird: she follows, in the form of
hound, otter, hawk; finally he becomes a wheaten grain, she a hen,
and swallows the grain.</p>

<p>The ordinary tale has found its way into rhyme in a German
broadside ballad, Longard, Altrheinl&auml;ndische M&auml;hrlein
und Liedlein, p. 76, No 40, 'Von einem gottlosen Zanberer und
seiner unschuldigen Kindlein wunderbarer Erl&ouml;sung.' The two
children of an ungodly magician, a boy and a girl, are devoted by
him to the devil. The boy had read in his father's books while his
father was away. They flee, and are pursued: the girl becomes a
pond, the boy a fish. The wicked wizard goes for a net. The boy
pronounces a spell by which the girl is turned into a chapel, and
he into an image on the altar. The wizard, unable to get at the
image, goes for fire. The boy changes the girl into a
threshing-floor. himself into a barley-com . The wizard becomes a
hen, and is about to swallow the grain of barley. By another
spell the boy changes himself into a fox, and then twists the
hens, neck.</p>
