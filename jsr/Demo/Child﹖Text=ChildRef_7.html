<p>'Earl Brand,' first given to the world by Mr. Robert Bell in
1857, has preserved most of the incidents of a very ancient story
with a faithfulness unequalled by any ballad that has been
recovered from English oral tradition. Before the publication of
'Earl Brand,' <b>A</b> <b>c</b>, our known inheritance in this
particular was limited to the beautiful but very imperfect
fragment called by Scott 'The Douglas Tragedy,' <b>B</b>; half a
dozen stanzas of another version of the same in Motherwell's
Minstrelsy, <b>E</b>; so much of Percy's 'Child of Elle' as was
genuine, which, upon the printing of his manuscript, turned out
to be one fifth, <b>F</b>; and two versions of Erlinton,
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d007_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> What now can be added is but little: two
transcripts of 'Earl Brand,' one of which, <b>A</b> <b>a</b>, has
suffered less from literary revision than the only copy hitherto
printed, <b>A</b> <b>c</b>; a third version of 'The Douglas
Tragedy,' from Motherwell's manuscript, <b>C</b>; a fourth from
Kinloch's manuscripts, <b>D</b>; and another of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_8.html">Erlinton</a>,'
<b>B</b>. Even 'Earl Brand' has lost a circumstance that forms
the turning-point in Scandinavian ballads, and this capital defect
attends all our other versions, though traces which remain in
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_8.html">Erlinton</a>' make it nearly certain that our ballads originally
agreed in all important particulars with those which are to this
day recited in the north of Europe.</p>

<p>The corresponding <b>Scandinavian</b> ballad is 'Ribold and
Guldborg,' and it is a jewel that any clime might envy. Up to the
time of Grundtvig's edition, in Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, No 82,
though four versions had been printed, the only current copy for
a hundred and fifty years had been Syv's No 88, based on a
broadside of the date 1648, but compounded from several sources;
and it was in this form that the ballad became known to the
English through Jamieson's translation. Grundtvig has now
published twenty-seven versions of 'Ribold og Guldborg' (II,
347 ff, nineteen; 675 ff, four; III, 849 ff, four:<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d007_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
<a name="Page_I_89"/>
of all
which only two are fragments), and nine of 'Hildebrand og Hilde,'
No 83, which is the same story set in a dramatic frame-work (II,
393 ff, seven: 680 f, one; in, 857, one, a fragment). Three more
Danish versions of 'Ribold og Guldborg' are furnished by
Kristensen, Gamle jydske Folkeviser, I, No 37, II, No 84 <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b> (<b>C</b>*, <b>D</b>*, <b>E</b>*). To these we may add
the last half, sts 15-30, of 'Den farlige Jomfru,' Grundtvig,
184 <b>G</b>. Of Grundtvig's texts, 82 <b>A</b> is of the sixteenth
century; <b>B</b>-<b>H</b> are of the seventeenth; the remainder
and Kristensen's three from recent tradition. Six versions of
'Hildebrand og Hilde,' <b>A</b>-<b>F</b>, are of the seventeenth
century; one is of the eighteenth, <b>G</b>; and the remaining
two are from oral tradition of our day.</p>

<p>The first six of Grundtvig's versions of 'Ribold and
Guldborg,' <b>A</b>-<b>F</b>, are all from manuscripts, and all
of a pure traditional character, untampered with by "collators."
<b>G</b> and <b>H</b> are mixed texts: they have <b>F</b> for
their basis, but have admitted stanzas from other sources. Most
of the versions from recitation are wonderful examples and proofs
of the fidelity with which simple people "report and hold" old
tales: for, as the editor has shown, verses which never had been
printed, but which are found in old manuscripts, are now met with
in recited copies; and these recited copies, again, have verses
that occur in no Danish print or manuscript, but which
nevertheless are found in Norwegian and Swedish recitations, and,
what is more striking, in Icelandic tradition of two hundred
years' standing.</p>

<p>The story in the older Danish ballads runs thus. Ribold, a
king's son, sought Guldborg's love in secret. He said he would
carry her to a land where death and sorrow came not; where all
the birds were cuckoos, and all the grass was leeks, and all the
streams ran wine. Guldborg, not indisposed, asked how she should
evade the watch kept over her by all her family and by her
betrothed. Ribold disguised her in his cloak and armor, <b>B</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, and rode off, with Guldborg behind him. On
the heath they meet a rich earl [a crafty man, <b>C</b>; her
betrothed, <b>D</b>], who asks, Whither away, with your stolen
maid? [little page, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>.] Ribold replies that it
is his youngest sister, whom he has taken from a cloister,
<b>A</b>, <b>E</b> [sick sister, <b>C</b>; brother, <b>B</b>,
<b>F</b>; page, <b>D</b>]. This shift avails nothing; no more
does a bribe which he offers for keeping his secret. Report is at
once made to her father that Guldborg has eloped with Ribold.
Guldborg perceives that they are pursued, and is alarmed. Ribold
reassures her, and prepares to meet his foes. He bids Guldborg
hold his horse, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, and, whatever may
happen, not to call him by name: "Though thou see me bleed, name
me not to death; though thou see me fall, name me not at all!"
Ribold cuts down six or seven of her brothers and her father,
besides others of her kin; the youngest brother only is left, and
Guldborg in an agony calls upon Ribold to spare him, to carry
tidings to her mother. No sooner was his name pronounced than
Ribold received a mortal wound. He sheathed his sword, and said,
Come, wilt thou ride with me? Wilt thou go home to thy mother
again, or wilt thou follow so sad a swain? And she answered, I
will not go home to my mother again; I will follow thee, my
heart's dearest man. They rode through the wood, and not a word
came from the mouth of either. Guldborg asked, Why art thou not
as glad as before? And Ribold answered, Thy brother's sword has
been in my heart. They reached his house. He called to one to
take his horse, to another to bring a priest, and said his
brother should have Guldborg. But she would not give her faith to
two brothers. Ribold died that night, <b>C</b>. Three dead came
from Ribold's bower: Ribold and his lief, and his mother, who
died of grief! In <b>A</b> Guldborg slays herself, and dies in
her lover's arms.</p>

<p>'Hildebrand and Hilde,' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, opens with the heroine in a queen's service, sewing her
seam wildly, putting silk for gold and gold for silk. The queen
calls her to account. Hilde begs her mistress to listen to her
tale of sorrow. She was a king's daughter. Twelve knights had
been appointed to be her guard, and one had beguiled her,
Hildebrand, son of the king of England. They went off together,
<a name="Page_I_90"/>
and were surprised by her brothers [father, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>]. Hildebrand bade her be of good cheer; but she must not
call him by name if she saw him bleed or fall, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>. A heap of knights soon lay at his feet. Hilde
forgot herself, and called out, Hildebrand, spare my youngest
brother! Hildebrand that instant received a mortal wound, and
fell. The younger brother tied her to his horse, and dragged her
home. They shut her up at first in a strong tower, built for the
purpose, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> [Swedish <b>A</b>, a dark house], and
afterwards sold her into servitude for a church bell. Her
mother's heart broke at the bell's first stroke, and Hilde, with
the last word of her tale, fell dead in the queen's arms.</p>

<p>The most important deviation of the later versions from the
old is exhibited by <b>S</b> and <b>T</b>, and would probably be
observed in <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, as well, were these complete.
<b>S</b>, <b>T</b> are either a mixture of 'Ribold and Guldborg'
with 'Hildebrand and Hilde,' or forms transitional between the
two. In these Ribold does not live to reach his home, and
Guldborg, unable to return to hers, offers herself to a queen, to
spin silk and weave gold [braid hair and work gold]. But she
cannot sew for grief. The queen smacks her on the cheek for
neglecting her needle. Poor Guldborg utters a protest, but gives
no explanation, and the next morning is found dead. Singularly
enough, the name of the hero in <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>,
<b>T</b>, is also an intermediate form. Ribold is the name in all
the old Danish copies except <b>C</b>, and that has Ride-bolt. Danish
<b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Z</b>, all the Icelandic copies,
and Swedish <b>D</b>, have either Ribold or some unimportant
variation. <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>, have Ride-brand
[<b>T</b>, Rederbrand]. All copies of Grundtvig 83, except Danish
<b>G</b>, Swedish <b>C</b>, which do not give the hero's name,
have Hilde-brand; so also 82 <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>,
<b>V</b>, and Kristensen, I, No 37. The name of the woman is
nearly constant both in 82 and 83.</p>

<p>The paradise promised Guldborg in all the old versions of
82<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d007_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> disappears from the recited copies, except <b>K</b>,
<b>M</b>. It certainly did not originally belong to 'Ribold and
Guldborg,' or to another Danish ballad in which it occurs ('Den
trofaste Jomfru,' Grundtvig, 249 <b>A</b>), but rather to ballads
like 'Kvindemorderen,' Grundtvig, 183 <b>A</b>, or 'Liti
Kersti,' Landstad, 44, where a supernatural being, a demon or a
hillman, seeks to entice away a mortal maid. See No 4, p. 27. In
82 <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>Y</b>,
<b>&AElig;</b>, <b>&Oslash;</b>, and Kristensen's copies, the
lovers are not encountered by anybody who reports their flight.
Most of the later versions, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>,
<b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>&AElig;</b>,
<b>&Oslash;</b>, and Kristensen's three, make them halt in a
wood, where Ribold goes to sleep in Guldborg's lap, and is roused
by her when she perceives that they are pursued. So Norwegian
<b>B</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and 'Hildebrand
and Hilde' <b>B</b>. <b>M</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>,
<b>T</b>, <b>Z</b>, have not a specific prohibition of
<i>dead-naming</i>, but even these enjoin silence. 83 <b>C</b> is the
only ballad in which there is a fight and no prohibition of
either kind, but it is clear from the course of the story that
the stanza containing the usual injunction has simply dropped
out. <b>P</b> is distinguished from all other forms of the story
by the heroine's killing herself before her dying lover reaches
his house.</p>

<p>The four first copies of 'Hildebrand and Hilde,' as has been
seen, have the story of Ribold and Guldborg with some slight
differences and some abridgment. There is no elopement in
<b>B</b>: the lovers are surprised in the princess' bower. When
Hilde has finished her tale, in <b>A</b>, the queen declares that
Hildebrand was her son. In <b>B</b> she interrupts the narrative
by announcing her discovery that Hildebrand was her brother.
<b>C</b> and <b>D</b> have nothing of the sort. There is no fight
in <b>E</b>-<b>H</b>. <b>E</b> has taken up the commonplace of
the bower on the strand which was forced by nine men.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d007_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
Hildebrand is again the son of the queen, and, coming in just as
Hilde has expired, exclaims that he will have no other love, sets
his sword against a stone, and runs
<a name="Page_I_91"/>
upon it. <b>H</b> has the
same catastrophe. <b>F</b> represents the father as simply
showing great indignation and cruelty on finding out that one of
the guardian knights had beguiled his daughter, and presently
selling her for a new church bell. The knight turns out here
again to be the queen's son; the queen says he shall betroth
Hille, and Hille faints for joy. <b>G</b> agrees with <b>B</b> as
to the surprise in the bower. The knight's head is hewn off on
the spot. The queen gives Hilde her youngest son for a husband,
and Hilde avows that she is consoled. <b>I</b> agrees with <b>E</b> so
far as it goes, but is a short fragment.</p>

<p>There are three <b>Icelandic</b> versions of this ballad, 'Ribbalds
kv&aelig;&eth;i,' &Iacute;slenzk Fornkv&aelig;&eth;i, No 16, all
of the seventeenth century. They all come reasonably close to the
Danish as to the story, and particularly <b>A</b>. Ribbald, with no
prologue, invites Gullbr&uacute;n "to ride." He sets her on a
white horse; of all women she rode best. They have gone but a
little way, when they see a pilgrim riding towards them, who
hails Ribbald with, Welcome, with thy stolen maid! Ribbald
pretends that the maid is his sister, but the pilgrim knows very
well it is Gullbr&uacute;n. She offers her cloak to him not to
tell her father, but the pilgrim goes straight to the king, and
says, Thy daughter is off! The king orders his harp to be
brought, for no purpose but to dash it on the floor once and
twice, and break out the strings. He then orders his horse.
Gullbr&uacute;n sees her father come riding under a hill-side,
then her eleven brothers, then seven brothers-in-law. She begs
Ribbald to spare her youngest brother's life, that he may carry
the news to her mother. He replies, I will tie my horse by the
reins; you take up your sewing! then three times forbids her to
name him during the fight. He slew her father first, next the
eleven brothers, then the other seven, all which filled her with
compunction, and she cried out, Ribbald, still thy brand! On the
instant Ribbald received many wounds. He wiped his bloody sword,
saying, This is what you deserve, Gullbr&uacute;n, but love is
your shield; then set her on her horse, and rode to his brother's
door. He called out, Here is a wife for you! But Gullbr&uacute;n
said, Never will I be given to two brothers. Soon after Ribbald
gave up the ghost. There was more mourning than mirth; three
bodies went to the grave in one coffin, Ribbald, his lady, and
his mother, who died of grief.</p>

<p><b>B</b> and <b>C</b> have lost something at the beginning,
<b>C</b> starting at the same point as our 'Douglas Tragedy.' The
king pursues Ribbald by water. Gullbr&uacute;n (<b>B</b>) stands
in a tower and sees him land. Ribbald gives Gullbr&uacute;n to
his brother, as in <b>A</b>: she lives in sorrow, and dies a
maid.</p>

<p><b>Norwegian.</b> ('Ribold and Guldborg.') <b>A</b>, 'Rikeball
og stolt Gu&eth;bj&ouml;rg,' Landstad, 33; <b>B</b>, 'Veneros og stolt
Olleber,' Landstad, 34; <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,
in part described and cited, with six other copies, Grundtvig,
III, p. 853 f. The last half of Landstad No 23, stanzas 17-34, and
stanzas 18-25 of Landstad 28 <b>B</b>, also belong here. <b>A</b> agrees with
the older Danish versions, even to the extent of the paradise.
<b>B</b> has been greatly injured. Upon the lady's warning
Veneros of the approach of her father, he puts her up in an
oak-tree for safety. He warns her not to call him by name, and
she says she will rather die first; but her firmness is not put
to the test in this ballad, some verses having dropped out just
at this point. Veneros is advised to surrender, but dispatches
his assailants by eighteen thousands (like Lille br&oacute;r, in
Landstad, 23), and by way of conclusion hews the false P&aacute;l
greive, who had reported his elopement to &Ouml;lleber's father, into
as many pieces. He then takes &Ouml;lleber on his horse, they ride
away and are married. Such peculiarities in the other copies as
are important to us will be noticed further on.</p>

<p>('Hildebrand and Hilde.') <b>A</b>, one of two Norwegian
copies communicated by Professor Bugge to Grundtvig, III, 857 f,
agrees well with Danish <b>E</b>, but has the happy conclusion of
Danish <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>. The heroine is sold for
<i>nine</i> bells. <b>B</b>, the other, omits the bower-breaking
of <b>A</b> and Danish <b>E</b>, and ends with marriage.</p>

<p>The <b>Swedish</b> forms of 'Ribold and Guldborg' are: <b>A</b>,
'Hillebrand,' Afzelius, No 2; <b>B</b>, 'Herr Redebold,' and
<b>C</b>, 'Kung Vallemo,'
<a name="Page_I_92"/>
Afzelius, No 80; new ed., No 2,
<font size="-1">1, 2, 3</font>;
<b>D</b>, 'Ribbolt,' Arwidsson, No 78; <b>E</b>, 'Herr
Redebold' <b>F</b>, 'Herting Liljebrand,' and <b>G</b>, 'Herr
Balder,' in Cavallius and Stephens' manuscript collection;
<b>H</b>, 'Kung Walmon,' <b>E</b>. Wigstr&ouml;m's Folkdiktning,
No 15, p. 33. <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, are not
markedly different from the ordinary Danish ballad, and this is
true also, says Grundtvig, of the unprinted versions, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>, <b>G</b>. <b>D</b> and <b>G</b> are of the seventeenth
century, the others from recent tradition. Ribold is pictured in
<b>D</b> as a bold prince, equally versed in runes and arts as in
manly exercises. He visits Gi&ouml;tha by night: they slumber sweet,
but wake in blood. She binds up his wounds with rich kerchiefs.
He rides home to his father's, and sits down on a bench. The king
bids his servants see what is the matter, and adds, Be he sick or
be he hurt, he got it at Gi&ouml;tha-Lilla's. They report the prince
stabbed with sharp pikes within, and bound with silk kerchiefs
without. Ribold bids them bury him in the mould, and not blame
Gi&ouml;tha-Lilla; "for my horse was fleet, and I was late, and he
hurtled me 'gainst an apple-tree" (so Hillebrand in <b>A</b>).
<b>E</b> represents the heroine as surviving her lover, and
united to a young king, but always grieving for Redebold.</p>

<p>'Hildebrand and Hilde' exists in Swedish in three versions:
<b>A</b>, a broadside of the last part of the seventeenth
century, now printed in the new edition of Afzelius, p. 142 ff of
the notes (the last nine stanzas before, in Danske Viser, III,
438 f); <b>B</b>, Afzelius, No 32, new ed. No 26, <b>C</b>,
Arwidsson, No 107, both taken down in this century. In <b>A</b>
and <b>B</b> Hillebrand, son of the king of England, carries off
Hilla; they halt in a grove; she wakes him from his sleep when
she hears her father and seven brothers coming; he enjoins her
not to call him by name, which still she does upon her father's
being slain [or when only her youngest brother is left], and
Hillebrand thereupon receives mortal wounds. He wipes his sword,
saying, This is what you would deserve, were you not Hilla. The
youngest brother ties Hilla to his horse, drags her home, and
confines her in a dark house, which swarms with snakes and
dragons (<b>A</b> only). They sell her for a new church bell, and
her mother's heart breaks at the first sound. Hilla falls dead at
the queen's knee. <b>C</b> has lost the dead-naming, and ends
with the queen's promising to be Hilla's best friend.</p>

<p>A detailed comparison of the English ballads, and especially
of 'Earl Brand,' with the Scandinavian (such as Grundtvig has
made, III, 855 f) shows an unusual and very interesting
agreement. The name Earl Brand, to begin with, is in all
probability a modification of the Hildebrand found in Danish 82
<b>N</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>C</b>*, in all
versions of Danish 83, and in the corresponding Swedish <b>A</b>.
Ell, too, in Percy's fragment, which may have been Ell&euml; earlier,
points to Hilde, or something like it, and Erl-inton might easily
be corrupted from such a form as the Alibrand of Norwegian
<b>B</b> (Grundtvig, III, 858). Hildebrand is the son of the king
of England in Danish 83 <b>A</b>-<b>E</b>, and the lady in 'Earl
Brand' is the same king's daughter, an interchange such as is
constantly occurring in tradition. Stanza 2 can hardly be the
rightful property of 'Earl Brand.' Some thing very similar is met
with in 'Leesome Brand,' and is not much in place there. For 'old
Carl Hood,' of whom more presently, Danish 82 <b>X</b> and
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b> have an old man, Danish <b>C</b> a
crafty man, <b>T</b> a false younker, and Norwegian <b>B</b> and
three others "false P&aacute;l greive." The lady's urging Earl Brand to
slay the old carl, and the answer, that it would be sair to kill
a gray-haired man, sts 8, 9, are almost literally repeated in
Norwegian <b>A</b>, Landstad, No 33. The knight does slay the old
man in Danish <b>X</b> and Norwegian <b>C</b>, and slays the
court page in Danish <b>Z</b>, and false P&aacute;l greive in Norwegian
<b>B</b>, &mdash; in this last <i>after</i> the battle. The question, "Where
have ye stolen this lady away?" in st. 11, occurs in Danish 82
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>R</b>,
<b>S</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>Z</b>, in Norwegian <b>B</b> and Icelandic
<b>B</b>, and something very similar in many other copies. The
reply, "She is my sick sister, whom I have brought from
Winchester" [nunnery] , is found almost literally in Danish
<b>C</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Z</b>: "It is my sick sister; I took her
yesterday from the cloister." [Danish <b>E</b>, it is my youngest
sister from the cloister; she is sick: Danish <b>A</b>,
<a name="Page_I_93"/>
youngest
sister from cloister: Danish <b>R</b> and Norwegian <b>B</b>,
sister from cloister: Danish <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>, sister's
daughter from cloister: Norwegian <b>F</b>, sister from Holstein:
Danish <b>P</b>, Icelandic <b>A</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, sister.]
The old man, crafty man, rich earl, in the Scandinavian ballads,
commonly answers that he knows Guldborg very well; but in Danish
<b>D</b>, where Ribold says it is a court page he has hired, we
have some thing like sts 14, 15: "Why has he such silk-braided
hair?" On finding themselves discovered, the lovers, in the
Scandinavian ballad, attempt to purchase silence with a bribe:
Danish <b>A</b>-<b>I</b>, <b>M</b>, Icelandic and Norwegian
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. This is not expressly done in 'Earl Brand,'
but the same seems to be meant in st. 10 by "I'll gie him a
pound." St. 17 is fairly paralleled by Danish <b>S</b>, 18, 19:
"Where is Guldborg, thy daughter? Walking in the garden,
gathering roses;" and st. 18, by Norwegian <b>B</b>, 15: "You may
search without and search within, and see whether &Ouml;lleber
you can find." The announcement in st. 19 is made in almost all
the Scandinavian ballads, in words equivalent to "Ribold is off
with thy daughter," and then follows the arming for the pursuit.
The lady looks over her shoulder and sees her father coming, as
in st. 21, in Danish 82 <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>,
<b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Z</b>, and Norwegian
<b>A</b>.</p>

<p>The scene of the fight is better preserved in the Scottish
ballads than in 'Earl Brand,' though none of these have the
cardinal incident of the death-naming. All the Scottish versions,
<b>B</b>-<b>F</b>, and also '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_8.html">Erlinton</a>,' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, make
the lady hold the knight's horse: so Danish 82 <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>&AElig;</b>, <b>D</b>*,
Icelandic <b>C</b>, Norwegian and Swedish <b>A</b>, and Danish 83
<b>D</b>. Of the knight's injunction, "Name me not to death,
though thou see me bleed," which, as has been noted, is kept by
nearly every Danish ballad (and by the Icelandic, the Norwegian,
and by Swedish 'Ribold and Guldborg,' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, Swedish 'Hildebrand and Hilde,' <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>), there is left in English only this faint trace, in
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_8.html">Erlinton</a>,' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>: "See ye dinna change your cheer
until ye see my body bleed." It is the wish to save the life of
her youngest brother that causes the lady to call her lover by
name in the larger number of Scandinavian ballads, and she adds,
" that he may carry the tidings to my mother," in Danish 82
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>X</b>, 83 <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>.
Grief for her father's death is the impulse in Danish 82
<b>I</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>,
<b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>&AElig;</b>, <b>&Oslash;</b>, <b>A</b>*,
<b>C</b>*, <b>D</b>*, <b>E</b>*, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>H</b>. English <b>A</b> says nothing of father or
brother; but in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, it is the
father's death that causes the exclamation. All the assailants
are slain in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_8.html">Erlinton</a>' <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, except an aged knight
[the auldest man], and he is spared to carry the tidings home.
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_8.html">Erlinton</a>' <b>C</b>, however, agrees with the oldest Danish
copies in making the youngest brother the motive of the lady's
intervention. It is the fifteenth, and last, of the assailants
that gives Earl Brand his death-wound; in Danish <b>H</b>, the
youngest brother, whom he has been entreated to spare; and so,
apparently, in Danish <b>C</b> and Norwegian <b>A</b>.</p>

<p>The question, "Will you go with me or return to your mother? "
which we find in English <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, is met
with also in many Danish versions, 82 <b>B</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>U</b>,
<b>Z</b>, <b>&AElig;</b>, <b>&Oslash;</b>, <b>C</b>*, and Swedish
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. The dying man asks to have his bed
made in English <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, as in Danish 82 <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>X</b>,
<b>&AElig;</b>, <b>&Oslash;</b>, <b>C</b>*, <b>D</b>*, Norwegian
<b>A</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, and
desires that the lady may marry his brother in English <b>A</b>,
as in nearly all the Danish versions, Icelandic <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, Norwegian <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
Swedish <b>C</b>. He declares her a maiden true in 'Earl Brand,'
<b>A</b> <b>c</b> 33, and affirms the same with more particularity in
Danish 82 <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>M</b>, <b>&Oslash;</b>, Icelandic <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, Norwegian
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, Swedish <b>C</b>. The growth of the
rose and brier [bush and brier] from the lovers' grave in English
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, is not met with in any version of 'Ribold and
Guldborg' proper, but 'Den farlige Jomfru' <b>G</b>, Grundtvig,
184, the last half of which, as already remarked, is a fragment
of a Ribold ballad, has a linden in place of the rose and
brier.</p>

<p>No complete ballad of the Ribold class is known to have
survived in <b>German</b>, but a few verses have been interpolated by
tradition in the earliest copy of the Ulinger ballad (vv. 47-56),
which may almost with certainty be assigned to one of the other
description.

They disturb the narrative where they are, and a
ready occasion for their slipping in was afforded by the scene
being exactly the same in both ballads: a knight and a lady, with
whom he had eloped, resting in a wood.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d007_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> See No 4, p. 32 of

<p>We find in a pretty <b>Neapolitan-Albanian</b> ballad, which, with
others, is regarded by the editors as a fragment of a connected
poem, several of the features of these northern ones. A youth
asks a damsel in marriage, but is not favored by her mother,
father, or brother. He wins over first the mother and then the
father by handsome presents, but his gifts, though accepted, do
not conciliate the brother. He carries off the lady on horseback,
and is attacked by the brother, four uncles, and seven cousins.
He is killed and falls from his horse; with him the lady falls
dead also, and both are covered up with stones. In the spring the
youth comes up a cypress, the damsel comes up a vine, and
encloses the cypress in her arms. (Rapsodie d'un poema albanese
raccolte nelle colonie del Napoletano, de Rada and de' Coronei,
Florence, 1866, lib. ii., canto viii.)</p>

<p>These ballads would seem to belong among 
the numerous ramifications of the Hilde saga. 
Of these, the second lay of Helgi Hunding-slayer, in S&aelig;mund's Edda, and 'Waltharius,' 
the beautiful poem of Ekkehard, are most like 
the ballads.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d007_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Leaving 'Waltharius' till we 
come to '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_8.html">Erlinton</a>,' we may notice that Sigr&uacute;n, 
in the Helgi lay, though promised by her father 
to another man, H&ouml;dbrodd, son of Granmar, 
preferred Helgi. She sought him out, and told 
him frankly her predicament: she feared, she 
said, the wrath of her friends, for breaking her 
father's promise. Helgi accepted her affection, and bade her not care for the displeasure 
of her relatives. A great battle ensued between
Helgi and the sons of Granmar, who were 
aided by Sigrun's father and brothers. All her 
kinsmen were slain except one brother, Dag. 
He bound himself to peace with Helgi, but, 
notwithstanding, made sacrifices to Odin to 
obtain the loan of his spear, and with it slew 
Helgi. We have, therefore, in so much of 
the lay of Helgi Hundingslayer, the groundwork
of the story of the ballads: a woman, 
who, as in many of the Ribold ballads, has 
been betrothed to a man she does not care for, 
gives herself to another; there is a fight, in 
which a great number of her kinsmen fall; 
one brother survives, who is the death of the 
man she loves. The lay of Helgi Hi&ouml;rvard's 
son, whose story has much in common with 
that of his namesake, affords two resemblances 
of detail not found in the lay of the Hundingslayer. Helgi Hi&ouml;rvard's son, while his 
life-blood is ebbing, expresses himself in almost the words of the dying Ribold: "The 
sword has come very near my heart." He 
then, like Ribold and Earl Brand, declares his 
wish that his wife should marry his brother, 
and she, like Guldborg, declines a second 
union.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d007_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<a name="Page_I_95"/>
<p>There is also a passage in the earlier history of Helgi
Hundingslayer of which traces appear to be preserved in ballads,
and before all in the English ballad 'Earl Brand,' <b>A</b>.
Hunding and Helgi's family were at feud. Helgi introduced himself
into Hunding's court as a spy, and when he was retiring sent
word to Hunding's son that he had been there disguised as a son
of Hagal, Helgi's foster-father. Hunding sent men to take him,
and Helgi, to escape them, was forced to assume woman's clothes
and grind at the mill. While Hunding's men are making search, a
mysterious blind man, surnamed the bale-wise, or evil-witted
(Blindr inn b&ouml;lv&iacute;si), calls out, Sharp are the eyes
of Hagal's maid; it is no churl's blood that stands at the mill;
the stones are riving, the meal-trough is springing; a hard lot
has befallen a war-king when a chieftain must grind strange
barley; fitter for that hand is the sword-hilt than the
mill-handle. Hagal pretends that the fierce-eyed maid is a virago
whom Helgi had taken captive, and in the end Helgi escapes. This
malicious personage reappears in the Hr&ocirc;mund saga as "Blind the
Bad" and "the Carl Blind, surnamed Bav&iacute;s," and is found
elsewhere. His likeness to "old Carl Hood," who "comes for ill,
but never for good," and who gives information of Earl Brand's
flight with the king's daughter, does not require to be insisted
on. Both are identical, we can scarcely doubt, with the blind
[one-eyed] old man of many tales, who goes about in various
disguises, sometimes as beggar, with his hood or hat slouched
over his face, &mdash; that is Odin, the S&iacute;&eth;h&ouml;ttr or
Deep-hood of S&aelig;mund, who in the saga of Half and his
champions is called simple Hood, as here, and expressly said to
be Odin.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d007_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Odin, though not a thoroughly malignant divinity,
had his dark side, and one of his titles in S&aelig;mund's Edda is
B&ouml;lverkr, <i>maleficus</i>. He first caused war by casting his spear
among men, and Dag, after he has killed Helgi, says Odin was the
author of all the mischief, for he brought strife among
kinsmen.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d007_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The disastrous effects of "naming" in a great emergency appear
in other northern traditions, though not so frequently as one
would expect. A diverting Swedish saga, which has been much
quoted, relates how St. Olof bargained with a troll for the
building of a huge church, the pay to be the sun and moon, or St.
Olof himself. The holy man was equally amazed and embarrassed at
seeing the building run up by the troll with great rapidity, but
during a ramble among the hills had the good luck to discover
that the troll's name was Wind and Weather, after which all was
easy. For while the troll was on the roof of the church, Olof
called out to him,</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Wind and Weather, hi!<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You've set the spire awry;'</p>

<p>and the troll, thus called by his name, lost his strength,
fell off, and was dashed into a hundred pieces, all flint stones.
(Iduna, Part 3, p. 60 f, note. Other forms of the same story in
Afzelius, Sago-Hafder, III, 100 f; Faye, Norske Folke-Sagn, p.
14, 2d ed.; Hofberg, Nerikes Gamla Minnen, p. 234.)</p>

<p>It is a Norwegian belief that when a nix assumes the human
shape in order to carry some one off, it will be his death if the
selected victim recognizes him and names him, and in this way a
woman escaped in a ballad. She called out, So you are the Nix,
that pestilent beast, and the nix "disappeared in red
<a name="Page_I_96"/>
blood."
(Faye, as above, p. 49, note.) A nix is baffled in the same way
in a F&aelig;roe and an Icelandic ballad cited by Grundtvig, II,
57.</p>

<p>The marvellous horse Blak agrees to carry Waldemar
[Hildebrand] over a great piece of water for the rescue of his
daughter [sister], stipulating, however, that his name shall not
be uttered. The rider forgets himself in a panic, calls to the
horse by his name, and is thrown off into the water. The horse,
whose powers had been supernatural, and who had been <i>running</i> over
the water as if it were land, has now only ordinary strength, and
is forced to swim. He brings the lady back on the same terms,
which she keeps, but when he reaches the land he is bleeding at
every hair, and falls dead. (Landstad, 58; Grundtvig, 62;
Afzelius, 59, preface; Kristensen, I, No 66.)</p>

<p>Klaufi, a berserker, while under the operation of his peculiar
fury, loses his strength, and can no longer wield the weapon he
was fighting with, upon Griss's crying out, "Klaufi, Klaufi, be
not so mad!" (Svarfd&aelig;la Saga, p. 147, and again p. 156 f.) So
the blood-thirst of the avenger's sword in the magnificent Danish
ballad 'H&aelig;vnersv&aelig;rdet' is restrained by naming. (Grundtvig,
No 25, st. 35.) Again, men engaged in <i>hamfarir</i>, that is in roving
about in the shape of beasts, their proper bodies remaining
lifeless the while, must not be called by name, for this might
compel them to return at once to their own shape, or possibly
prevent their ever doing so. (Kristni Saga, ed. 1773, p. 149. R.
T. King, in Notes and Queries, 2d Ser., II, 506.) Grundtvig
remarks that this belief is akin to what is related in F&aacute;fnism&aacute;l
(prose interpolation after st. 1), that Sigurd concealed his name
by reason of a belief in old times that a dying man's word had
great power, if he cursed his foe by name. (D. g. F., II, 340.)</p>

<p>The beautiful fancy of plants springing from the graves of
star-crossed lovers, and signify ing by the intertwining of stems
or leaves, or in other analogous ways, that an earthly passion
has not been extinguished by death, presents itself, as is well
known, very frequently in popular poetry. Though the graves be
made far apart, even on opposite sides of the church, or one to
the north and one to the south outside of the church, or one without
kirk wall and one in the choir, however separated, the vines
or trees seek one another out, and mingle their branches or their
foliage:</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Even from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even in our ashes live their wonted fires!"</p>

<p>The principal ballads which exhibit this conception in one or
another form are the following:</p>

<p>In English, 'The Douglas Tragedy,' '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_74.html">Fair Margaret and Sweet William</a>,'
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_73.html">Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</a>,' '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_64.html">Fair Janet</a>,'
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_87.html">Prince Robert</a>,' '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_75.html">Lord Lovel</a>.' The plants in
all these are either a brier
and a rose, or a brier and a birk.</p>

twice. The lovers had thrown themselves into a deep lake; plants
rose above the surface of the water and intertwined (p. 91); the
bodies were brought up by divers and buried in the church, where
the marvel was repeated.</p>

<p>The idea of the love-animated plants has been thought to be
derived from the romance of Tristan, where it also occurs;
agreeably to a general principle, somewhat hastily assumed, that
when romances and popular ballads have anything in common,
priority belongs to the romances. The question as to precedence
in this instance is an open one, for the fundamental conception
is not less a favorite with ancient Greek than with mediaeval
imagination.</p>

<p>Tristan and Isolde had unwittingly drunk of a magical potion
which had the power to induce an indestructible and
ever-increasing love. Tristan died of a wound received in one of
his adventures, and Isolde of a broken heart, because, though
summoned to his aid, she arrived too late for him to profit by
her medical skill. They were buried in the same church. According
to the French prose romance, a green brier issued from Tristan's
tomb, mounted to the roof, and, descending to Isolde's tomb, made
its way within. King Marc caused the brier to be cut down three
several times, but the morning after it was as flourishing as
before.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d007_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Eilhart von Oberge, vv. 9509-21 (ed. Lichtenstein, Quellen u.
Forschungen, xix, 429) and the German prose romance (Busching u.
von der Hagen, Buch der Liebe, c. 60), Ulrich von Th&uuml;rheim,
vv. 3546-50, and Heinrich von Freiberg, vv. 6819-41 (in von der
Hagen's ed. of G. v. Strassburg's Tristan) make King Marc
<i>plant</i>, the first two a grape-vine over Tristan and a rose
over Isolde, the others, wrongly, the rose over Tristan and the
vine over Isolde. These plants, according to Heinrich, struck
their roots into the hearts of the lovers below, while their
branches embraced above. Icelandic ballads and an Icelandic saga
represent Tristan's wife as forbidding the lovers to be buried in
the same grave, and ordering them to be buried on opposite sides
of the church. Trees spring from their bodies and meet over the
church roof. (&Iacute;slenzk Fornkv&aelig;&eth;i, 23 <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>;

<p>Among the miracles of the Virgin there are several which are
closely akin to the prodigies already noted. A lily is found
growing from the mouth of a clerk, who, though not leading an
exemplary life, had every day said his ave before the image of
Mary: Unger, Mariu Saga, No 50; Berceo, No 3; Miracles de N.-D.
de Chartres, p. lxiii, No 29, and p. 239; Marien-legenden
(Stuttgart, 1846), No xi and p. 269. A rose springs from the
grave and
<a name="Page_I_99"/>
roots in the heart of a knight who had spared the honor
of a maid because her name was Mary: Unger, No clvi, Hagen's
Gesammtabenteuer, lxxiii. Roses inscribed Maria grow from the
mouth, eyes, and ears of a monk: Unger, cxxxvii; and a lily grows
over a monk's grave, springing from his mouth, every leaf of
which bears Ave Maria in golden letters: Unger, cxxxviii;
Gesammtabenteuer, lxxxviii; Libro de Exenplos, Romania, 1878, p.
509, 43, 44; etc., etc.</p>

<p>No one can fail to be reminded of the purple, lily-shaped
flower, inscribed with the mournful AI AI, that rose from the
blood of Hyacinthus, and of the other from the blood of Ajax,
with the same letters, "his name and eke his plaint," haec
nominis, illa querellae. (Ovid, Met. x, 210 ff; xiii, 394 ff.)
The northern lindens have their counterpart in the elms from the
grave of Protesilaus, and in the trees into which Philemon and
Baucis were transformed. See, upon the whole subject, the essay
of Koberstein in the Weimar Jahrbuch, I, 73 ff, with K&ouml;hler's
supplement, p. 479 ff; Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, II, 689 f, and
III, 246.</p>

<p>"The ballad of the 'Douglas Tragedy,'" says Scott, "is one of
the few to which popular tradition has ascribed complete
locality. The farm of Blackhouse, in Selkirkshire, is said to
have been the scene of this melancholy event. There are the
remains of a very ancient tower, adjacent to the farm-house, in a
wild and solitary glen, upon a torrent named Douglas burn, which
joins the Yarrow after passing a craggy rock called the Douglas
craig. . . . From this ancient tower Lady Margaret is said to
have been carried by her lover. Seven large stones, erected upon
the neighboring heights of Blackhouse, are shown, as marking the
spot where the seven brethren were slain; and the Douglas burn is
averred to have been the stream at which the lovers stopped to
drink: so minute is tradition in ascertaining the scene of a
tragical tale, which, considering the rude state of former times,
had probably foundation in some real event."</p>

<p>The localities of the Danish story were as certained, to her
entire satisfaction, by Anne Krabbe in 1605-6, and are given
again in Resen's Atlas Danicus, 1677. See Grundtvig, II, 342
