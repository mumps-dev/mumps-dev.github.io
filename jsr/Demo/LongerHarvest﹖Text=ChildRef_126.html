<p>Printed in Old Ballads, 1723, 1, 83.</p>

<p><b>a</b> was printed by Ritson, Robin Hood, 1795, II, 30.
Evans has an indifferent copy, probably edited, in his Old
Ballads, 1777, 1784, I, 112.</p>

<p>Arthur a Bland, a Nottingham tanner, goes of a summer's
morning into Sherwood forest to see the red deer. Robin Hood
pretends to be a keeper and to see cause for staying the Tanner.
The Tanner says it will take more than one such to make him
stand. They have a two hours' fight with staves, when Robin cries
Hold! The Tanner henceforth shall be free of the forest, and if
he will come and live there with Robin Hood shall have both gold
and fee. Arthur a Bland gives his hand never to part from Robin,
and asks for Little John, whom he declares to be his kinsman.
Robin Hood blows his horn. Little John comes at the call, and,
learning what has been going on, would like to try a bout with
the Tanner, but after a little explanation throws himself upon
his kinsman's neck. The three take hands for a dance round the
oak-tree.</p>

<p>The sturdy Arthur a Bland is well hit off, and, bating the
sixteenth and thirty-fifth stanzas, the ballad has a good popular
ring. There is corruption at 8<sup>3</sup>, 12<sup>3</sup>, and
perhaps 13<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>Little John offers to fight with the Tinker in No 127, and
again with the Stranger in No 128, as here with the Tanner, and
is forbidden, as here, by his master. In R.H. and the Shepherd,
No 135, he undertakes the Shepherd after Robin has owned himself
conquered, and the fight is stopped after John has received some
sturdy blows. In the Bold Pedlar and Robin Hood, No 132, John
begins and Robin follows, and each in turn cries, Pedlar, pray
hold your hand. In R.H. and the Potter, No 121, John is ready to
bet on the Potter, because he has already had strokes from him
which he has reason to remember.</p>

<p>As the Tanner is John's cousin, so, in Robin Hood Revived, No
128, the Stranger turns out to be Robin Hood's nephew, Young
Gamwell, thenceforward called Scathlock; and in No 132 the Bold
Pedlar proves to be Gamble Gold, Robin's cousin.</p>
