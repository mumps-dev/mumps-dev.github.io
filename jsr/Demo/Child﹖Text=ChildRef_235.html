<p>The copy in The New Deeside Guide, by James Brown [Joseph
Robertson], Aberdeen, 1832, p. 26, is <b>B</b> <b>a</b> with a
few editorial changes. It is repeated in The Deeside Guide,
Aberdeen, 1889, with slight variations. The copy in Christie's
Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 22, is "given from the way the editor
has heard it sung, assisted by Mr. Buchan's copy in his
Gleanings;" in fact, it is <b>B</b> <b>a</b> with unimportant
variations, which must be treated as arbitrary. Smith's New
History of Aberdeenshire, I, 207, repeats Aytoun, nearly, and
Aytoun, II, 309, 1859, <b>B</b> <b>a</b>, nearly.</p>

<p>None of the versions here given go beyond 1800. Mrs. Brown of
Falkland, in an unprinted letter to Alexander Fraser Tytler,
December 23, 1800, offers him 'The Death of the Countess of
Aboyne,' which she had heard sung when a child: see p. 309,
note.</p>

<p><b>A</b>-<b>I</b>. The Earl of Aboyne (who is kind but
careless, <b>E</b>) goes to London without his wife, and stays
overlong. Information comes by letter that he has married there,
<b>B</b>, or that he is in love with another woman, <b>D</b>.
Word is brought that he is on his way home, and very near. His
lady orders stable-grooms, minstrels, cooks, housemaids, to
bestir themselves, <b>A</b>-<b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, makes a
handsome toilet, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>, and calls for wine to drink his health, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>G</b>. She comes down to the close to take
him from his horse, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, and
bids him thrice welcome. "Kiss me then for my coming," says the
earl, and surprises his wife, and all of us, by adding that the
morrow would have been his wedding-day, if he had stayed in
London. The lady gives him an angry and disdainful answer. This
he resents, and orders his men to mount again; he will go first
to the Bog of Gight to see the Marquis of Huntly, and then return
to London. The lady attempts, through a servant, to get
permission to accompany him, but is repulsed, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b> (misplaced in <b>G</b>). According to
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> 24, <b>F</b>, the countess
languished for about a twelvemonth, and then died of a broken
heart; but <b>D</b> 25, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, make her death ensue
before or shortly after the earl's arrival at the Bog o Gight.
Aboyne is very much distressed at the tidings; he would rather
have lost all his lands than Margaret Irvine, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. He goes to the burial with a train
of gentlemen, all in black from the hose to the hat, <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b> (horse to the hat, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>).</p>

<p><b>J</b>. No Earl of Aboyne ever married an Irvine, and no
Earl of Aboyne would have meditated open bigamy, and have
informed his wife while receiving her welcome home how near he
had come to perpetrating the same. The historical difficulty and
the practical absurdity are removed by assuming that <b>J</b>
alone has preserved (or restored) the true and original story,
and that all the other copies, beginning with Mrs. Brown's, which
calls the lady the Countess of Aboyne, have gone wrong. In
<b>J</b>, Peggy Irvine is only Aboyne's love, <b>I</b> 3, and
Aboyne is her true lover, 8<sup>3</sup>. Aboyne was careless and
kind, and kind to every woman, and Aboyne staid over long in
London, <b>A</b>, and the ladies they did invite him, <b>H</b>.
Under these circumstances, some Aboyne may have been on the brink
of deserting a Peggy Irvine to whom he was engaged.</p>

<p>Aboyne is Boyn, <b>D</b>, Boon, <b>H</b>; Irvine is Harboun,
Harvey, <b>D</b>, Ewan, <b>B</b>, <b>K</b>; Bog o Gight is Bogs o
the Geich, <b>D</b>, Bogs o the Gay, <b>G</b>, Bughts o the
Gight, <b>H</b>, Bogo Keith, <b>J</b>. The Bog o Gight is made
Aboyne's property in <b>D</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. The Marquis of
Huntly is blamed by Aboyne for inciting him to unkindness,
<b>D</b> 28, <b>G</b> 11.</p>
