<td><i>Jamieson, Popular Ballads and Songs,</i> I, 48, <i>says
that he gives his text verbatim as it was taken from the
recitation of the lady in Fifeshire (Mrs. Brown), to whom both he
and Scott were so much indebted. That this is not to be
understood with absolute strictness will appear from the
variations which are subjoined. Jamieson adds that he had
received another copy from MrsArrott of Aberbrothick, "but as it
furnished no readings by which the text could have been
materially improved," it was not used. Both Jamieson and Scott
substitute the "Binnorie" burden, "the most common and popular,"
says Scott, for the one given by Mrs. Brown, with which Mrs.
Arrott's agreed. It may be added that Jamieson's interpolations
are stanzas</i> 20, 21, 27, <i>etc., and not, as he says (I,</i>
49), 19, 20, 27, <i>etc. These interpolations also occur as such

"It is compiled from a copy in Mrs. Brown's manuscript,
intermixed with a beautiful fragment, of fourteen verses,
transmitted to the editor by J.C. Walker, Esq., the ingenious
historian of the Irish bards. Mr. Walker, at the same time,
favored the editor with the following note: ' I am indebted to my
departed friend, Miss Brooke, for the foregoing pathetic
fragment. Her account of it was as follows: This song was
transcribed, several years ago, from the memory of an old woman,
who had no recollection of the concluding verses; probably the
beginning may also be lost, as it seems to commence abruptly.'
The first verse and burden of the fragment run thus:<br/>

"'O sister, sister, reach thy hand!<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hey ho, my Nanny, O,<br/>
And you shall be heir of all my land.<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While the swan swims bonny,'"<br/>

Miller's Melody' <i>sung by an old lady in his childhood, and who
represents himself as probably the last survivor of those who had
enjoyed the privilege of listening to her ballads. We may, there
fore, assign this version to the latter part of the</i> 18th
<i>century. The two four-line stanzas were sung to</i> "a slow,
quaint strain." <i>Two others which followed were not
remembered,</i> "but their purport was that the body 'stopped
hard by a miller's mill,' and that this 'miller chanced to come
by,' and took it out of the water 'to make a melodye.'" <i>G.A.C.
goes on to say:</i> "My venerable friend's tune here became a
more lively one, and the time quicker; but I can only recollect a
few of the couplets, and these not correctly nor in order of
sequence, in which the transformation of the lady into a viol is
described."</td></tr>
