<h3>Advertisement to part VIII</h3>

<p>Numbers 226-265</p>

<p>A considerable portion of this eighth number is devoted to 
texts from Abbotsford. Many of these were used by Sit Walter 
Scott in the compilation of the Minstrelsy of the Scottish 
Border; many, again not less important than the others, did not 
fins a place in that collection. They are now printed either 
absolutely for the first time, or for the first tiome without 
variation from the form in which theu were written. All of them, 
and others which were obtained in season for the Seventh Part, 
were transcribed with the most concientious and vigilant care by 
Mr. Macmath, who has also identified the handwriting, has 
searched the numerous volumes of letters addressed to Sir Wwlter 
Scott for information relating to the contributors and for dates, 
and has examined the humbler editions of printed ballads in the 
Abbotsdford Library; this without remitting other help.</p>

<p>Very cordial thanks are offered, for text or information, or 
for both, to the Rev. S. Baring-Gould, The Rec. W. Forbes-Leith, 
Mr. Andrew Lang, Dr. George Birkbeck Hill, Mr. P.Z. Round, Dr. 
F.J. Furnivall, Mr. James Barclay Murdoch, Dr. Giuseppe 
Pitr&egrave;, of Palermo, Mr. William Walker, of Aberdeen, Mr. 
David MacRitchie, of Edinburgh, Mr. James Gibb, of Joppa, Mr. 
james Raine, of York, Rev. William Leslie Christie, of London, 
Mrs. Mary Thomson, of Fochabers, and Mr. George M. Richardson, 
late of Harvard College; for notes on Slavic popular literature, 
to Mr. John Kar&#322;owicz, of Warsaw, and Professor Wilhelm Wollner; 
and for miscellaneous notes, to my colleague, Professor 
G.L. Kittredge.</p>

<p>So far as can be foreseen, one part more will being this book 
to a close; it is therefore timely to say again that I shall be 
flad of any kind of assistance that will make it less imperfect, 
whether it is in the way of supplying omissions or correcting 
errors, great or small.</p>
