<p>'Verkel Vejemands&oslash;n,' Grundtvig, IV, 151, No 198,
invites a comparison with 'Young Benjie,' although the ballads,
in the form in which they are now extant, are widely divergent.
Verkel Vejemands&oslash;n, seeing maid Gundelild shining in her
virgin crown, makes a fiendish vow to rob her of it. He rides up
to her house and asks where her father and mother are. They are
away from home. He carries her off on his horse into the thickest
of a wood, and bids her hold the beast while he makes a bed of
leaves. He loses her in the thicket, and cannot find her, though
he looks for her a day and two days. She goes to the strand and
throws herself into the sea, saying, It was a very different
bride-bed that my mother meant me to have. She is drawn out in a
fisherman's net. Verkel swears that he has not seen her for eight
years, but he is convicted of his crime, on evidence not given,
and "clothes three stakes;" that is, he is hanged, and parts of
his body are exposed on the wheels which crown the three posts of
a gallows.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott's observations on the passage in which the
drowned maid reveals the author of her death are too interesting
to be spared:</p>

<p>"In this ballad the reader will find traces of a singular
superstition, not yet altogether discredited in the wilder parts
of Scotland. The lykewake, or watching a dead body, in itself a
melancholy office, is rendered, in the idea of the assistants,
more dismally awful by the mysterious horrors of superstition. In
the interval betwixt death and interment, the disembodied spirit
is supposed to hover round its mortal habitation, and, if invoked
by certain rites, retains the power of communicating, through its
organs, the cause of its dissolution. Such inquiries, however,
are always dangerous, and never to be resorted to unless the
deceased is suspected to have suffered foul play, as it is
called. It is the more unsafe to tamper with this charm in an
unauthorized manner, because the inhabitants of the infernal
regions are, at such periods, peculiarly active. One of the most
potent ceremonies in the charm, for causing the dead body to
speak, is setting the door ajar, or half open. On this account
the peasants of Scotland sedulously avoid leaving the door ajar
while a corpse lies in the house. The door must either be left
wide open or quite shut; but the first is always preferred, on
account of the exercise of hospitality usual on such occasions.
The attendants must be likewise careful never to leave the corpse
for a moment alone, or, if it is left alone, to avoid, with a
degree of superstitious horror, the first sight of it.</p>

<p>"The following story, which is frequently related by the
peasants of Scotland, will illustrate the imaginary danger of
leaving the door ajar. In former times a man and his wife lived
in a solitary cottage on one of the extensive Border fells. One
day the husband died suddenly, and his wife, who was equally
afraid of staying alone by the corpse, or leaving the dead body
by itself, repeatedly went to the door, and looked anxiously over
the lonely moor for the sight of some person approach ing. In her
confusion and alarm she accidentally left the door ajar, when the
corpse suddenly started up and sat in the bed, frowning and
grinning at her frightfully. She sat alone, crying bitterly,
unable to avoid the fascination of the dead man's eye, and too
much terrified to break the sullen silence, till a Catholic
priest, passing over the wild, entered the cottage. He first set
the door quite open, then put his little finger in his mouth, and
said the paternoster backwards; when the horrid look of the
corpse relaxed, it fell back on the bed, and behaved itself as a
dead man ought to do.</p>

<p>"The ballad is given from tradition. I have been informed
by a lady of the highest literary eminence [Miss Joanna Baillie],
that she has heard a ballad on the same subject, in which the
scene was laid upon the banks of the Clyde. The chorus was,</p>

<p>O Bothwell banks bloom bonny,</p>

<p>and the watching of the dead corpse was said to have taken
place in Bothwell church."</p>
