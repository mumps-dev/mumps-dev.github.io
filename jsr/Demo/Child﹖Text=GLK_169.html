<h3>169. Johnie Armstrong</h3>

<p>'Ihonne Ermistrangis dance' is mentioned in The Complaynt of
(Scotland, 1549 (ed. Murray, p. 66). The ballad is known in two
forms, &mdash; one represented by <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, the
other by <b>C</b>. It was an early favorite of Goldsmith's: "The
music of the finest singer is dissonance to what I felt when our
old dairy-maid sung me into tears with Johnny Armstrong's Last
Good-Night, or the Cruelty of Barbara Allen" (Essays, 1765, p.
14).</p>

<p>The Armstrongs were people of consideration in Liddesdale from
the end, or perhaps from the middle, of the fourteenth century,
and hy the sixteenth had become the most important sept, as to
numbers, in that region, not only extending themselves over a
large part of the Debateable Land, but spreading also into
Eskdale, Ewesdale, Wauchopedale, and Annandale The Earl of
Northumberland, in 1528, puts the power of the Armstrongs, with
their adherents, above three thousand horsemen. Mangerton, in
Liddesdale, on the east bank of the Liddel, a little north of its
junction with the Kersope, was the seat of the chief. John
Armstrong, known later as Gilnockie, a brother of Thomas, laird
of Mangerton, is first heard of in 1525. Removing from Liddesdale
early in the century, as it is thought, he settled on the church
lands of Canonby, and at a place called The Hollows, on the west
side of the Esk, built a tower, which still remains. The
Armstrongs, if nominally Scots, were so far from being "in due
obeysaunce" that, at a conference of commissioners of both realms
in November of the year 1528, the representatives of the Scottish
king could not undertake to oblige them to make a redress for
injuries done the English, though a peace depended upon this
condition. Both the English and the Scottish border suffered from
their forays. Other measures having failed, King James V, in
1530, took the pacifying of his borders into his own hand, and
for this purpose levied an army of from eight to twelve thousand
men. Among the reivers who suffered death was John Armstrong of
Gilnockie, the hero of the present ballad. It appears from
various accounts that his capture was not effected by honorable
means. There is no record of a trial, and the execution was
probably as summary as the arrest was perfidious.</p>
