<p>The copy of 'Lord Thomas and Fair Annet' in Herd, 1769, p.
246, 1776, I, 24, and in the Musical Museum, p. 553, No 535, is
Percy's, A.</p>

<p>The English version of this ballad, 'Lord Thomas and Fair
Ellinor,' given, with alterations, in Percy's Reliques, III, 82,
1765,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d073_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> is a broadside of Charles the Second's time, printed
for I. Clarke, W. Thackeray, and T. Passenger, and licensed by
L'Estrange, who was censor from 1663 to 1685. This copy has become
traditional in Scotland and Ireland. The Scottish traditional
copy, 'Lord Thomas and Fair Annet,' given by Percy in the
Reliques (unfortunately with some corrections, but these cannot
have been many), is far superior, and one of the most beautiful
of our ballads, and indeed of all ballads. '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_74.html">Fair Margaret and Sweet William</a>,'
"a more pathetic story of the man who loves one
woman and marries another," begins in the same way, with the last
long talk before parting. The conclusion is that the forsaken
maid dies of grief, not by the hand of her incensed rival, and it
is most natural that the two stories should be blended in
tradition, as they are here in <b>E</b>-<b>H</b>, <b>B</b> 31 ff,
<b>F</b> 27 ff, <b>G</b> 24 ff, <b>H</b> 37 ff belonging to
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_74.html">Fair Margaret and Sweet William</a>.'</p>

<p>There is a copy of 'Lord Thomas and Fair Ellinor,' written
over for the ballad-mongers, and of course much less in the
popular style, in Pepys, IV, 48, No 45, and Roxburghe, II, 553,
with the title 'The Unfortunate Forrester, or, Fair Eleanor's
Tragedy.' In this Fair Ellinor stabs herself and Lord Thomas then
kills himself with the same dagger.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d073_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Norse ballads have the story of 'Lord Thomas and Fair Annet,'
coming very close in details. Those forms which are nearest to
the English resemble more the mixed versions, <b>B</b>-<b>H</b>,
than the simple, <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>. But in none of the Norse
ballads is love thwarted because it stands upon the choice of
friends. A man abandons a woman who is in all but the name his
wife, and who regards herself, and is evidently regarded by
others, as standing in no dishonorable relation to him. There is
again a bifurcation in the catastrophe. The forsaken mistress
submits and hangs herself in the one case, in the other she takes
a fierce revenge. The latter conclusion may well, as Grundtvig
holds, be the more original, but the ballads which have the other
will here be put first, as being nearer to the English.</p>

derived therefrom. <b>B</b>. 'Herr Peders Slegfred,' broadside of
the seventeenth century, Grundtvig, IV, 216, No 210; Danske

century, Grundtvig, IV, 215. <b>F</b>. 'Liten Kerstins
H&auml;md,' c. 1700, Arwidsson, I, 305, No 45.</p>

<p>Sir Peter and Liten Kerstin sit at table talking merrily,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>. Peter informs Kerstin that he is to
be married. She says she shall not fail to be present; he, that
the wedding will be too far away for anybody to come. She shall
come, if asked, though it be in Rome, <b>B</b>. If you come, says
Peter, you must not wear your gold. She will wear it, for it was
got by no dishonor, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>. Peter rides off, Kerstin
wrings her hands: alack for the maid that trusts a loon! He makes
the preparations for his bridal, and she orders her clothes,
which are of the richest description, all pearls and gold.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d073_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
She has her horse shod, as in English, <b>B</b> 21, <b>C</b> 12,
<b>E</b> 22. When she enters the hall, wives and maids stand up,
<b>B</b>. She pours wine for the guests. The bride asks who she
is, and is told that it is Sir Peter's mistress.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d073_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> She has
more gold on her kirtle's hem, says the bride, than all that Sir
Peter owns. Why, if he had her, did he come seeking me? After the
usual long delay the bride is conducted to the bride-house,
Kerstin carrying the torch before her. Kerstin even puts the
bride to bed. She leaves the room, saying, <b>A</b>, I trow I
shall come here no more, goes into the orchard, and hangs herself
with her hair. Sir Peter is informed of what has happened, rushes
to the orchard, takes Kerstin down, has a grave dug deep and
broad, sets his sword against a stone, and runs on it. The next
day, as so often, there are three dead, Sir Peter, Kerstin, and
the bride, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. In <b>C</b>, Peter hangs himself
on the same tree.</p>

<p>Not so moving, but considerably more powerful and original, is
the other termination of the story. In <b>B</b>, after Kerstin
has lighted the bride to the bride-house, she draws a knife and
kills Peter. She tells the bride that this should have been her
death too, had she not spoken her so fair. In <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>,
she sets fire to the house and burns the bride on the
bridegroom's arm.</p>

<p>A Southern ballad has something of the outline of the English
and Norse, and sounds like a thin echo of them. <b>A</b>.

<p>A youth is obliged by his father to give up his love for a
bride who is less beautiful but richer. He has a dream that his
love is dead, and carries her a rose, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>. He
invites her to the wedding: she will not come to the ceremony,
but to the dance. She has three gowns made for the occasion, the
third embroidered with gold, or of gold stuff. She falls dead
while dancing: she falls on the right, he on the left. In
<b>G</b>, after his love has died, the bridegroom draws his sword
and kills himself. <b>C</b> and one copy of <b>D</b> have the
phenomenon of the sympathetic plants, as in English <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>.</p>

<p><b>E</b> 3 is a sort of commonplace when unequal 
matches are in question. So in a fragment in 
Herd's manuscripts, I, 55, II, 187:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'I hae nae houses, I hae nae lands,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hae nae gowd or fee, Sir;<br/>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your loon I'll never be, Sir.'</td></tr>

<p>And again Motherwell's Manuscript, p. 37. It is

Third Part of Henry VI, III, 2:</p>

<p>With regard to <b>B</b> 20, 'I'll na put on the 
dowie green,' Kinloch remarks that green is 
considered unfortunate in love matters, the 
couplet running,</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Green is love deen,<br/>
Yellow 's forsaken;</td></tr>

</table>

<p>whereas blue is looked upon as a most fortunate color: "blue is love true." "To be 
married in a green colored dress is ominous of 
misfortune, for according to the proverb:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>They that marry in green,<br/>
Their sorrow is soon seen.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>And no young woman in the North would wear that color on her
wedding day. An old lady of my acquaintance, whose marriage had
proved unfortunate, used seriously to warn young women to beware
of being married in green, for she attributed her own misfortunes
solely to her having been married in a green gown, which she had
put on contrary to the sage advice of her seniors, in whose minds
the belief was more firmly rooted, and who had wished her to wear
in its stead a blue dress, as being the more lucky color. To
dance in green stockings is a proverbial phrase applied to an
elder sister when the younger is first married, intimating that
she may mourn her hapless fate, as she has now no chance of being
married. To dream of green is believed to be the presage of
misfortune." Kinloch Manuscripts, I, 15 f.</p>
