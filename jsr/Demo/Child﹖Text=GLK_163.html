<h3>163. The Battle of Harlaw</h3>

<p>The Battle of Harlaw was fought on the 24th July, 1411. Donald
of the Isles, to maintain his claim to the Earldom of Ross,
invaded the country south of the mountains with ten thousand
islanders and men of Ross in the hope of sacking Aberdeen, and
reducing to his power the country as far as the Tay. He was met
at Harlaw, eighteen miles northwest of Aberdeen, by Alexander
Stewart, Earl of Mar, and Alexander Ogilby, sheriff of Angus,
with the forces of Mar. Garioch, Angus, and The Mearns, and his
further progress was stayed. The Celts lost more than nine
hundred, the Lowlanders five hundred, including nearly all the
gentry of Buchan. This defeat was in the interest of civilization
against savagery, and was felt, says Burton, "as a more memorable
deliverance even than that of Bannockburn."</p>

<p>As might be expected, the Lowlanders made a ballad about this
hard fight. 'The battel of the Hayrlau' is noted among other
popular songs, in immediate connection with 'The fiunttis of
Chevet,' by the author of The Complaynt of Scotland, 1549, but
most unfortunately this ancient song, unlike Chevy Chase, has
been lost. There is a well-known poem upon the battle, printed by
Ramsay, in his Ever Green. 1724, but it is not in the least of a
popular character.</p>
