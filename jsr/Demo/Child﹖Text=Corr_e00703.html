<p>P. 88 a. <b>B</b>. "The copy principally used in this edition
of the ballad was supplied by Mr. Sharpe." Scott. "The Douglas
Tragedy was taught me by a nursery-maid, and was so great a
favorite that I committed it to paper as soon as I was able to
write." Sharpe's Letters, ed. Allardyce, I, 135, August 5, 1802.
Sharpe was born in 1781.</p>

<p>88 b. 'Hr. Kibolt,' Kristensen, Skattegraveren, VI, 17, No
257, is a good copy of 'Ribold og Guldborg.' It has the
testaments at the end, like several others (see I, 144 b).</p>

<p>89-91 a. 'Stolt Hedelil,' Kristensen, Skattegraveren, I, 68,
No 231, is another version of 'Hildebrand og Hilde,' closely
resembling <b>G</b>. So is 'Den mislykkede flugt,' the same,
VIII, 17, No 24, with the proper tragic conclusion. Both are
inferior copies.</p>

<p>92 a and 489 b. Add: <b>K</b>, 'Kung Vallemo ock liten 
Kerstin,' Bergstr&ouml;m ock Nordlander, Nyare Bidrag, 
o.s.v., p. 101.</p>

<p>95 b, 96, 489. I have omitted to mention the effect 
of naming on 'Clootie' in No 1, <b>C</b> 19, I, 5:</p>

<p>The Alpthier loses its power to harm and appears in its proper
shape, as this or that person, if called by name: Wuttke, Der
deutsche Volksaberglaube der Gegenwart, 2d ed., p. 257. Were-
wolves appear in their proper human shape on being addressed by
their name: Wilhelm Hertz, Der Werwolf, pp. 61, 84, Ulrich Jahn,
Volkssagen aus Pommern u. R&uuml;gen, pp. 386-7. An enchanted
prince is freed when his name is pronounced: Meier, No 53, p. 188
and n., p. 311. "There was in the engagement a man [on the side
of Hades] who could not be vanquished unless his name could be
discovered:" Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales, I, 167, as quoted by
Rhys, Celtic Mythology, Hibbert Lectures, p. 244. (G.L.K.)</p>

<p>96 ff., 489, II, 498. Plants from lovers' graves.</p>

<p>Add: <b>Portuguese</b>, Romero, II, 157, two pines.</p>

<p><b>Italian</b>, Nigra, No 18, 'Le due Tombe,' p. 125 ff..</p>

<p><b>A</b>. The lovers are buried apart, one in the church, one
outside, a pomegranate springs from the man's grave, an
almond-tree from the maid's; they grow large enough, to shade
three cities! <b>B</b>. A pomegranate is planted on the man's
grave, a hazel on the maid's; they shade the city, and interlock.
<b>C</b>. An almond-tree is planted on the maid's grave, and is
cut down. <b>D</b>. The lovers are buried as in <b>A</b> (and
<b>C</b>), an almond-tree grows from the grave of the man, a
jessamine from the maid's. See also No 19, 'Fior di Tomba,'
where, however, there is but one grave, which is to contain the
maid's parents as well as her lover. The same phenomenon in the
fragments <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>. 'Il Castello d'Oviglio,' Ferraro,
Canti p. monferrini, No 45, p. 64, is another version of this
ballad. A pomegranate springs up at the maid's feet, and shades
three cities. Cf. 'La Mort des deux Amants,' Rolland, I, 247, No
125.</p>

<p><b>Roumanian</b>. 'Ring and Handkerchief' also in Marienescu,
Balade, p. 50: cited in M&eacute;lusine, IV. 142.</p>

<p>97 b and 489 f., II, 498 a. <b>Bulgarian</b>, Miladinof,
B&ugrave;lgarski narodni p&#277;sni, p. 455, No 497, translated
by Krauss, Sagen u. M&auml;rchen der S&uuml;dslaven, II, 427; the
youth as rose-tree, the maid as grape-vine. Cited by G. Meyer in
M&eacute;lusine, IV, 87. Little-Russian, plane-trees of the two sexes;
cited by J. Karlowicz, <i>ib.</i>, 87 f. Ruthenian (mother
attempting to poison her son's wife poisons both wife and son),
Herrmann, Ethnologische Mittheilungen, 205 f.; buried on
different sides of the church, plants meet over the roof of the
church, the mother tries to cut them down, and while so engaged
is turned into a pillar.</p>

<p><b>Servian</b>. Vuk, I, No 342, II, No 30; youth, pine, maid,
grape-vine. Krasi&#263;', p. 105, No 21, p. 114, No 26; vine and
pine, vine twines round pine. Bulgarian, Miladinof, p. 375, No
288, rose and vine. <b>Magyar-Croat</b>, Kurelac, p. 147, No 444,
grape-vine and rose; No 445, youth behind the church, maid
before, grape-vine and rose; p. 154, No 454, rosemary and a white
flower (aleluja?). (W.W.)</p>

<p><b>Breton</b>. M&eacute;lusine, III, 453 f. A tree springs from over
the young man's heart (but this is an insertion, and not quite
beyond suspicion), a rose from the maid's. There is another
version of the ballad at p. 182 f., in which une fleur
dor&eacute;e grows over the man's grave, nothing being said of
his mistress's grave, or even of her death.</p>

<p><b>Italo-Albanian</b>. Also in Vigo, Canti p. siciliani, 1857,
p. 345, V, and the edition of 1870-74, p. 698: cited in M&eacute;lusine,
IV, 87.</p>

<p><b>Gaelic</b>. Of Naisi (Naois) and Deirdre. King Conor caused
them to be buried far apart, but for some days the graves would
be found open in the morning and the lovers found together. The
king ordered stakes of yew to be driven through the bodies, so
that they might be kept asunder. Yew trees grew from the stakes,
and so high as to embrace each other over the cathedral of
Armagh. Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Dublin, I, 133,
1808.</p>

<p>In a Scotch-Gaelic version recently obtained, after Naois is
put into his grave, Deirdre jumps in, lies down by his side and
dies. The bad king orders her body to be taken out and buried on
the other side of a loch. Firs shoot out of the two graves and
unite over the loch. The king has the trees cut down twice, but
the third time his wife makes him desist from his vengeance on
the dead. The original in Transactions of the Gaelic Society of
Inverness, XIII, 257; a translation in The Celtic Magazine, XIII,
138. (All of these cited by Gaidoz, M&eacute;lusine, IV, 12, and
62, note.)</p>
