<h3>Brown Robyn's Confession</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 110.
Motherwell's Manuscript, p. 580. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d05701.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>The only known version of 'Brown Robyn's Confession' is the one
printed in Ballads of the North of Scotland, the copy in
Motherwell's Manuscript having been derived from Buchan.</p>

<p>The ballad, as we have it in English, celebrates a miracle of
the Virgin, and is our only example of that extensive class of
legends, unless we choose to include 'The Jew's Daughter,' and to
take Robin Hood's view of the restoration of his loan, in the
fourth Fit of the Little Gest. Of rescues on the sea, by which
Mary "vere maris stella indiciis evidentissimis comprobatur," we
have two in most of the collections of the Virgin's miracles,
e.g., Vincent of Beauvais, 1. VII, cc 88, 89, Gautier de Coincy,
ed. Poquet, pp 515, 605. The deliverance, however, <i>is</i> for
honor done to Mary, and <i>not</i> for a fair confession.</p>

<p>A fine ballad, very common in Sweden, and preserved by
tradition also in Denmark and Norway, has the same story with a
tragical termination for the hero, saving a single instance, in
which there is also a supernatural interference in his behalf.</p>

the story of these ballads is this. Sir Peter asks his
foster-mother what death he shall die. You are not to die in your
bed, she says, and not in fight, but beware of the waves. Peter
cares not for the waves, and builds a splendid ship, the bulk and
masts of whalebone (elm, Swedish <b>D</b>; walnut, Norwegian,
Danish <b>D</b>), the flags of gold (oars, Danish <b>A</b>). Let
us drink to-day, while we have ale, says Peter; to-morrow we will
sail where gain shall guide. The skipper and helmsman push off,
forgetful of God the Father, God's Son, and the Holy Ghost. They
sail a year or two on the boiling sea, and when they come where
water is deepest the masts begin to go, Swedish <b>A</b>; the
ship stops, Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, Norwegian,
Danish <b>A</b>, C, <b>D</b>;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d057_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> will not mind her helm, Danish
<b>B</b>. They cast lots to see who is the sinner; the skipper
and captain do this while Peter is in his cabin sleeping,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d057_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in
Swedish <b>D</b>, Norwegian, Danish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. The lot
falls on Peter. He makes his shrift, since there is no priest,
before the mast (which, with the yard, forms a cross), Swedish
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, Norwegian, Danish <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>; before
an oar, on which Our Lord stands written, Danish <b>A</b>.
"Churches have I plundered, and convents have I burned, and
stained the honor of many a noble maid. I have roamed the woods
and done both robbery and murder, and many an honest peasant's
son buried alive in the earth:" Swedish <b>A</b>. He then says
his last words, Danish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, and nearly all.</p>

It was a sad sight to see when he made a cross on the blue wave,
and so took the wild path that lay to the sea's deep bottom. Sir

<p>No explanation is offered of this marvel. In the light of the
Scottish ballad, we should suppose that Sir Peter's deliverance
in Danish <b>A</b> was all for the fair confession he made upon
the sea.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d057_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Saxo relates that, in the earlier part of Thorkill's marvellous
voyage, the crews of his three ships, when reduced almost to
starving, coming upon an island well stocked with herds, would
not heed the warning of their commander, that if they took more
than sufficed to mitigate their immediate sufferings they might
be estopped from proceeding by the local divinities, but loaded
the vessels with carcasses. During the night which followed, the
ships were beset by a crowd of monsters, the biggest of whom
advanced into the water, armed with a huge club, and called out
to the seafarers that they would not be allowed to sail off till
they had expiated the offence they had committed by delivering up
one man for each ship. Thorkill, for the general safety,
surrendered three men, selected by lot, after which they had a
good wind and sailed on. Book VIII; p. 161, ed. 1644.</p>

<p>King Half on his way home from a warlike expedition encountered
so violent a storm that his ship was nigh to foundering. A
resolution was taken that lots should be cast to determine who
should jump overboard. But no lots were needed, says the saga
(implying, by the way, that a vicarious atonement was
sufficient), for the men vied with one another who should go
overboard for his comrade. Fornaldar S&ouml;gur, Rafn, II, 37

<p>A very pretty Little-Russian <i>duma</i>, or ballad, also
shows the efficacy of confession in such a crisis: 'The Storm on
the Black Sea,' Maksimovitch, Songs of Ukraine, p. 14, Moscow,
1834, p. 48, Kief, 1849; translated by Bodenstedt, Die poetische
Ukraine, p. 118. The Cossack flotilla has been divided by a storm
on the Black Sea, and two portions of it have gone to wreck. In
the third sails the hetman. He walks his deck in sombre
composure, and says to the sailors, Some offence has been done,
and this makes the sea so wild: confess then your sins to God, to
the Black Sea, and to me your hetman; the guilty man shall die,
and the fleet of the Cossacks, not perish. The Cossacks stand
silent, for no one knows who is guilty, when lo, Alexis, son of
the priest of Piriatin, steps forth and says, Let me be the
sacrifice; bind a cloth round my eyes, a stone about my neck, and
throw me in; so shall the fleet of the Cossacks not perish. The
men are astounded: how can a heavy sin be resting on Alexis, who
reads them the sacred books, whose example has kept them from
wickedness! Alexis left home, he says, without asking his
father's and mother's blessing, and with an angry threat against
his brother; he wrenched the last crust of bread from his
neighbors; he rode along the street wantonly spurning the breasts
of women and the foreheads of children; he passed churches
without uncovering, without crossing himself: and now he must die
for his sins. As he makes this shrift the storm begins to abate;
to the amazement of the Cossacks, the fleet is saved, and not one
man drowned.</p>

<p>The rich merchant Sadko, the very entertaining hero of several
Russian popular epics, is nowhere more entertaining than when,
during one of his voyages, his ship comes to a stop in the sea.
He thinks he has run upon a rock or sand-bank, and tries to push
off, but the vessel is immovable. Twelve years we have been
sailing, says Sadko, and never paid tribute to the king of the
sea. A box of gold is thrown in as a peace-offering, but floats
like a duck. It is clear that the sea-king wants no toll; he
requires a man. Every man is ordered to make a lot from
pine-wood and write his name on it. These lots are thrown into
the sea. Everyone of them swims like a duck but Sadko's, and his
goes down like a stone. That is not the proper wood for a lot,
says Sadko: make lots of fir-wood. Fir lots are tried: Sadko's
goes down like a stone, the rest swim like ducks. Fir is not
right, either; alder, oak, are tried with the same result. We are
quite wrong, says Sadko; we must take
cypress, for cypress was the wood of the cross. They try cypress,
and still Sadko's lot sinks, while all the others float. I am the
man, says Sadko. He orders his men to get for him an oblation of
silver, gold, and pearls, and with this, taking an image of St.
Nicholas in one hand and his gusli in the other, commits
himself to the sea, and goes down like a stone. But not to
drown. It was quite worth his while for the rare adventures that
followed.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d057_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The casting of lots to find out the guilty man who causes
trouble to a ship occurs in William Guiseman, Kinloch's Ancient
Scottish Ballads, p. 156, Kinloch Manuscripts, V, 43, a copy,
improved by tradition, of the "lament" in 'William Grismond's
Downfal,' a broadside of 1650, which is transcribed among the
Percy papers, from Ballard's collection.</p>

<p>Captain Glen is thrown overboard without a lot, on the
accusation of the boatswain, and with the happiest effect;
broadside in the Roxburghe collection, Logan's Pedlar's Pack, p.
47, Kinloch Manuscripts, V, 278.</p>
