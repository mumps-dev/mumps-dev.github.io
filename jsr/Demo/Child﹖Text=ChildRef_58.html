<p>Stanzas of <b>E</b> and of <b>L</b>, a little altered, are
given by Motherwell in his Introduction, pp xlv, xlvi. The ballad
in the Border Minstrelsy, <b>H</b>, was made up from two
versions, the better of which was <b>G</b>, and five stanzas,
16-20, recited by Mr. Hamilton, sheriff of Lanarkshire. Mr.
Hamilton is said to have got his fragment "from an old nurse, a
retainer of the Gilkerscleugh family," when himself a boy, about
the middle of the last century.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d058_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The copy in Finlay's
Scottish Ballads, I, 49, is Scott's, with the last stanza
exchanged for the last of <b>A</b>, and one or two trifling
changes. The imperfect copies <b>K</b>, stanzas 6-10, <b>M</b> 1,
3, show admixture with the more modern ballad of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_245.html">Young Allan</a>.'
<b>L</b> 1, with variations, is found in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_62.html">Fair Annie</a> of
Lochroyan,' Herd, 1776, I, 150, and may not belong here. But
ballad-ships are wont to be of equal splendor with Cleopatra's
galley: see, for a first-rate, the Scandinavian 'Sir Peter's
Voyage,' cited in the preface to '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_57.html">Brown Robyn's Confession</a>.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d058_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>This admired and most admirable ballad is one of many which
were first made known to the world through Percy's Reliques.
Percy's version remains, poetically, the best. It may be a
fragment, but the imagination easily supplies all that may be
wanting; and if more of the story, or the whole, be told in
<b>H</b>, the half is better than the whole.</p>

<p>The short and simple story in <b>A</b>-<b>F</b> is that the
king wants a good sailor to take command of a ship or ships ready
for sea. Sir Patrick Spens<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d058_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> is recommended, and the king
sends him a commission. This good sailor is much elated by
receiving a letter from the king, but the contents prove very
unwelcome.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d058_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> He would hang the man that praised his
seaman-ship, if he knew him, <b>B</b>; though it had been the
queen herself, she might have let it be, <b>F</b>; had he been a
better man, he might ha tauld a lee, <b>D</b>. The objection, as
we learn from <b>A</b> 5, <b>C</b> 5, is the bad time of year.
Percy cites a law of James III, forbidding ships to be freighted
out of the realm with staple goods between the feast of Simon and
Jude and Candlemas, October 28-February 2. There is neither
choice nor thought, but prompt obedience to orders. The ship must
sail the morn, and this without regard to the fearful portent of
the new moon having been seen late yestreen with the auld moon in
her arm. They are only a few leagues out when a furious storm
sets in. The captain calls for a boy to take the steer in hand
while he goes to the topmast to spy land, <b>B</b>; or, more
sensibly, sends up the boy, and sticks to the rudder, <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>. The report is not encouraging, or is not waited tor,
for the sea has everything its own way, and now the nobles, who
were loath to wet their shoes, are overhead in water, and now
fifty fathoms under. It would be hard to point out in ballad
poetry, or other, happier and more refined touches than the two
stanzas in <b>A</b> which portray the bootless waiting of the
ladies for the return of the seafarers.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d058_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>In <b>G</b>-<b>J</b> we meet with additional circumstances.
The destination of the ship is Norway. The object of the voyage
is not told in <b>G</b>; in <b>H</b> it is to bring home the king
of Norway's daughter; in <b>J</b> to bring home the Scottish
king's daughter; in <b>I</b> to take out the Scottish king's
daughter to Norway, where she is to be queen. The Scots make the
passage in two days, or three, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>.
After a time the Norwegians begin to complain of the expense
caused by their guests, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>; or reproach the Scots
with staying too long, to their own king's cost, <b>I</b>. Sir
Patrick tells them that he brought money enough to pay for
himself and his men, and says that nothing shall induce him to
stay another day in the country. It is now that we have the omen
of the new moon with the old moon in her arm, in <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>. In <b>I</b> this comes before the voyage to Norway,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d058_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
and in <b>G</b> the stanza expressing apprehension of a storm,
without the reason, occurs twice,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d058_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> before the voyage out as
well as before the return voyage. In <b>J</b>, as in
<b>A</b>-<b>F</b>, the ship is lost on the voyage out. In
<b>G</b>, therefore, and <b>I</b> as well, two different accounts
may have been blended.</p>

<p>Whether there is an historical basis for the shipwreck of
Scottish nobles which this ballad sings, and, if so, where it is
to be found, are questions that have been considerably discussed.
A strict accordance with history should not be expected, and
indeed would be almost a ground of suspicion.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d058_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>} Ballad
singers and their hearers would be as indifferent to the facts as
the readers of ballads are now; it is only editors who feel bound
to look closely into such matters. Motherwell has suggested a
sufficiently plausible foundation. Margaret, daughter of
Alexander III, was married, in 1281, to Eric, King of Norway. She
was conducted to her husband, "brought home," in August of that
year, by many knights and nobles. Many of these were drowned on
the return voyage,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d058_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> as Sir Patrick Spens is in <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>I</b>.</p>

<p>Margaret, Eric's queen, died in 1283, leaving a newly born
daughter; and Alexander III, having been killed by being thrown
from his horse, in 1286, the crown fell to the granddaughter. A
match was proposed between the infant Margaret, called the Maid
of Norway, and the eldest son of Edward I of England. A
deputation, not so splendid as the train which accompanied the
little maid's mother to Norway, was sent, in 1290, to bring the
Princess Margaret over, but she died on the way before reaching
Scotland. The Scalacronica speaks of only a single envoy, Master
Weland, a Scottish clerk. If "the chronicle will not lie," the
Maid of Norway and the Scottish clerk perished, we must suppose
in a storm, on the coasts of Boghan<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d058_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> (Buchan?). This is not
quite enough to make the ballad out of, and there is still less
material in the marriage of James III with the daughter of the
king of Norway in 1469, and no shipwreck chronicled at all.</p>

<p>No such name as Patrick Spens is historically connected with
any of these occurrences. Spens has even been said not to be an
early Scottish name. Aytoun, however, points to a notable exploit
by one Spens as early as 1336, and Mr. Macmath has shown me that
the name occurred in five charters of David II, therefore between
1329 and 1370. We might allege that Spens, though called Sir
Patrick in later days, was in reality only a skeely
skipper,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d058_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and that historians do not trouble themselves much
about skippers. But this would be avoiding the proper issue. The
actual name of the hero of a ballad affords hardly a presumption
as to who was originally the hero. This ballad may be historical,
or it may not. It might be substantially historical though the
command of the ship were invariably given to Sir Andrew Wood, a
distinguished admiral, who was born a couple of centuries after
the supposed event; and it might be substantially historical
though we could prove that Patrick Spens was only a shipmaster,
of purely local fame, who was lost off Aberdour a couple of
hundred years ago. For one, I do not feel compelled to regard the
ballad as historical.</p>

<p>A mermaid appears to the navigators in <b>J</b>, <b>L</b>,
<b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, and informs them, <b>J</b>, that they will
never see dry land, or are not far from land, <b>L</b>, <b>P</b>,
<b>Q</b>, which, coming from a mermaid, they are good seamen
enough to know means the same thing. The appearance of a mermaid
to seamen is a signal for despair in a brief little ballad, of no
great antiquity to all seeming, given further on under the title
of 'The Mermaid.' If nothing worse, mermaids  at least bode rough
weather, and sailors do not like to see them: Faye, Norske
Folke-Sagn, ed. 1844, p. 55 (Prior). They have a reputation for
treachery: there is in a Danish ballad, Grundtvig, II, 91, No 42,
<b>B</b> 14, one who has betrayed seven ships.</p>

<p>The place where the ship went down was half owre to Aberdour,
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>?; ower by Aberdour, <b>I</b>,
<b>J</b>, <b>N</b>; forty miles off Aberdeen, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>
(<b>H</b> may only repeat <b>G</b>); nore-east, norewest frae
Aberdeen, <b>D</b>; between Leith and Aberdeen, <b>K</b>.
<b>B</b> and <b>E</b> transfer the scene to St. Johnston (Perth),
and <b>P</b> to the Clyde, down below Dumbarton Castle. We may
fairly say, somewhere off the coast of Aberdeenshire, for the
southern Aberdour, in the Firth of Forth, cannot be meant.</p>

<p>The island of Papa Stronsay is said to be about half way
between Aberdour in Buchan and the coast of Norway, half owre to
Aberdour; and on this island there is a tumulus, which Mr.
Maidment informs us is known now, and <i>has always been</i>
known, as the grave of Sir Patrick Spens. Nothing more has been
transmitted, we are assured, but only the name as that of a man
buried there: Maidment, Scotish Ballads and Songs, Historical and
Traditionary, I, 31 f. "The Scottish ballads were not early
current in Orkney, a Scandinavian country," says Aytoun, "so it
is very unlikely that the poem could have originated the name."
With regard to this Orcadian grave of Patrick Spens, it may first
be remarked that Barry, who, in 1808, speaks of the Earl's Knowe
in Papa Stronsay, says not a word of the tradition now affirmed
to be of indefinite long-standing (neither does Tudor in 1883).
The ballad has been in print for a hundred and twenty years.
There are Scots in the island now, and perhaps there "always"
have been; at any rate, a generation or two is time enough for a
story to strike root and establish itself as tradition.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d058_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
