<h3>76. The Lass of Roch Royal</h3>


<p>213 a. Title of <b>B</b>. Not Lochroyan in Herd, I, 144, but,
both in title and text, Lochvoyan. In Herd, II, 60, the title has
Lochroyan; the word does not occur in so much of the text as
remains. Printed Lochroyan by Herd, and probably Lochroyan was
intended in I, 144, as the alternative, though the last letter
but one is indistinctly written, and may be read <i>e</i>.
<b>B</b> came to Herd "by post from a lady in Ayrshire (?), name
unknown." Also, No 38, <b>A</b> <b>a</b>, No 51, <b>A</b>
<b>a</b>; No 161, <b>B</b> <b>a</b>; No 220, <b>A</b>. Note (in
pencil, and indistinct as to the place), Herd's Manuscripts, I,
143.</p>

<p>215 a. A part of this ballad is introduced into two versions
of 'The Mother's Malison,' No 216; see IV, 186. See also 'Fair
Janet,' No 64, <b>A</b> 13, <b>D</b> 5, <b>G</b> 5.</p>

<p>217. <b>B</b>. Lochvoyan everywhere, not Lochroyan.</p>

<p>221. <b>E</b> 2<sup>2</sup>. Finlay, in a letter to Scott,
March 27, 1803 (Letters, I, No 87), says, "in a copy which I have
seen, with the music, it is a birchen, instead of a silver,
kame."</p>

<p>'The Lass of Lochroyan,' "Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border
Minstrelsy," No 82, Abbotsford. Communicated to Scott by Major
Henry Hutton, Royal Artillery, 24th December, 1802 (Letters I, No
77), as recollected by his father and the family.</p>

<p>Some ten stanzas of this version (16-19, 25-27, 30, 32, 34)
appear to have been used by Scott in compiling the copy printed
in his Minstrelsy, <b>E</b> <b>b</b>. (The note on <b>E</b>
<b>b</b>, p. 226, requires correction.) There is much in common
with <b>B</b>, <b>E</b> <b>a</b>, <b>F</b>.</p>
