<p>'Jellon Grame' was first given to the world in Scott's
Minstrelsy, in 1802. The editor says of this copy, <b>A</b>
<b>b</b>, "This ballad is published from tradition, with some
conjectural emendations. It is corrected by a copy in Mrs.
Brown's Manuscript [<b>A</b> <b>a</b>], from which it differs in
the concluding stanzas. Some verses are apparently modernized."
The only very important difference between Scott's version and
Mrs. Brown's is its having four stanzas of its own, the four
before the last two, which are evidently not simply modernized,
but modern.</p>

<p>There is a material difference between the story furnished by
<b>A</b> and what we learn from the three other copies. Jellon
Grame sends for his love Lillie Flower to come to the wood. She
is very eager to go, though warned by the messenger that she may
never come back. Jellon Grame, who has already dug her grave,
kills her because her father will hang him when it is discovered
that she has had a child by him. He brings up the child as his
sister's son. One day, when the boy asks why his mother does not
take him home, Jellon Grame (very unnaturally) answers, I slew
her, and there she lies: upon which the boy sends an arrow
through him.</p>

<p>In <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, the man is Henry, Hind Henry,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>; the maid is May Margerie, <b>B</b>,
May-a-Roe, <b>C</b>, Margerie, <b>D</b>. Margerie, in <b>B</b>,
receives a message to come to the wood to make her love a shirt,
which surprises her, for no month had passed in the year that she
had not made him three. Nevertheless, she goes, though warned by
her mother that there is a plot against her life. She is stopped
in the wood by Hind Henry, who kills her because she loves Brown
Robin. Word is carried that Margerie has been slain; her sister
hastens to the wood, takes under her care the child which
Margerie was going with, and calls him Brown Robin, after his
father. The lad goes to the wood one day after school to pull a
hollin wand, and meets Hind Henry at the place where the mother
had been killed. No grass is growing just there, and the boy asks
Hind Henry why this is so. Hind Henry, not less frank than Jellon
Grame, says, That is the very spot where I killed your mother.
The boy catches at Henry's sword and runs him through.</p>

<p><b>C</b> has nearly the same incidents as <b>B</b>, diluted
and vulgarized in almost twice as many verses. Brown Robin is
made to be Hind Henry's brother. The sister does not appear in
the action, and the child is brought up by the murderer, as in
<b>A</b>, but is named Robin Hood, after that bold robber. On
hearing from Hind Henry how his mother had come to her death,
young Robin sends an arrow to his heart.</p>

<p>A story is supplied from the "traditions of Galloway" for the
fragmentary, and perhaps heterogeneous, verses called <b>D</b>; I
suppose by Allan Cunningham. Margerie was beloved by two
brothers, and preferred the elder. Henry, the younger, forged a
billet to her by which he obtained a meeting in a wood, when he
reproached her for not returning his feelings: sts 1, 2. "She
expostulated with him on the impropriety of bringing her into an
unfrequented place for the purpose of winning affections which,
she observed, were not hers to be stow;" but expostulations as to
improprieties producing but slight effect in "those rude times,"
told him plainly that she was with child by his brother. Henry
drew his sword and killed Margerie. The elder brother, who was
hunting, was apprised of mischief by the omens in stanza 4.
"Astonished at this singular phenomenon, he immediately flew to
the bower of his mistress, where a page informed him she was gone
to the 'silver wood,' agreeably to his desire. Thither he spurred
his horse, and, meeting Henry with his bloody sword still in his
hand, inquired what he had been killing." The other replied as in
stanza 5. "A mutual explanation took place, and Henry fell by the
sword of his unhappy brother."</p>

<p>The resemblance of this ballad at the beginning to '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_83.html">Child Maurice</a>'
will not escape notice. Silver Wood, or the silver wood,
is found in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_83.html">Child Maurice</a>,' <b>A</b> 1, <b>G</b> 1. <b>A</b> 14,
<b>B</b> 10, <b>C</b> 15, is a commonplace: see No 66, <b>A</b>
28, 29, <b>B</b> 20, 21, <b>D</b> 9, <b>E</b> 40; No 70, <b>B</b>
25; No 81, <b>K</b> 13. <b>B</b> 13 is found in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_102.html">Willie and Earl Richard's Daughter</a>,'
<b>B</b> 24: cf. <b>A</b> 15. The phenomenon
in <b>D</b> 4 we have had in No 65, <b>D</b> 17.</p>

<p>'Jellon Grame,' and particularly versions <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, may be regarded as a counterpart to '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_89.html">Fause Foodrage</a>,'
and especially to versions <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, of that ballad. In
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_89.html">Fause Foodrage</a>,' <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and 'Jellon Grame,'
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, a woman has two lovers. The one who
is preferred is killed by the other in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_89.html">Fause Foodrage</a>;' in
'Jellon Grame' the woman herself is killed by the lover she has
rejected. This kind of interchange is familiar in ballads. In
both '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_89.html">Fause Foodrage</a>' and 'Jellon Grame' the son of the woman,
before he comes to manhood, takes vengeance on the murderer.</p>

<p>'Jellon Grame,' as well as '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_89.html">Fause Foodrage</a>,' has certainly
suffered very much in transmission. It is interesting to find an
ancient and original trait preserved even in so extremely
corrupted a version as <b>C</b> of the present ballad, a
circumstance very far from unexampled. In stanza 18 we read that
the child who is to avenge his mother "grew as big in ae year
auld as some boys woud in three," and we have a faint trace of
the same extraordinary thriving in <b>B</b> 15: "Of all the
youths was at that school none could with him compare." So in one
of the Scandinavian ballads akin to '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_89.html">Fause Foodrage</a>,' and more
remotely to 'Jellon Grame,' the corresponding child grows more in
two months than other boys in eight years:</p>

Bugge, Norske Folkeviser, No 23, st. 17, p. 113.</p>

<p>This is a commonplace: so again Bugge, No 5, sts 7, 8, p. 23.
Compare Robert le Diable, and Sir Gowther.</p>

<p>In <b>B</b> 14 we are told that the boy was called by his
father's name (<b>C</b> 17 is corrupted). This is a point in the
corresponding Scandinavian ballads: Danske Viser, No 126, st. 21,
No 127, st. 34; Levninger, No 12, st. 26, No 13, st. 18;
&Iacute;slenzk fornkv&aelig;&eth;i, No 28, st. 33 b; Bugge, No
23, st. 16; Kristensen, I, No 97, sts 7, 11, No 111, st. 9.</p>

<p><b>A</b> <b>b</b> is translated by Schubart, p. 69; by
