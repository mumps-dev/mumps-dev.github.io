<h3>King Henry</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'King Henry.'
<ol type="a">
<li>The Jamieson-Brown Manuscript, fol. 31.</li>
<li>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, 1802, II, 132. </li>
</ol> <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d03201.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Scott describes his copy of 'King Henry' as "edited from the
manuscript of Mrs. Brown, corrected by a recited fragment." This
manuscript of Mrs. Brown was William Tytler's, in which, as we
learn from Anderson's communication to Percy (see p. 62, above),
this ballad was No 11. Anderson notes that it extended to
twenty-two stanzas, the number in Scott's copy. No account is
given of the recited fragment. As published by Jamieson, II, 194,
the ballad is increased by interpolation to thirty-four stanzas.
"The interpolations will be found inclosed in brackets," but a
painful contrast of style of itself distinguishes them. They were
entered by Jamieson in his manuscript as well.</p>

<p>The fourteenth stanza, as now printed, the eighteenth in
Jamieson's copy, is not there bracketed as an interpolation, and
yet it is not in the manuscript. This stanza, however, with some
verbal variation, is found in Scott's version, and as it may
have been obtained by Jamieson in one of his visits to Mrs.
Brown, it has been allowed to stand.</p>

<p>Lewis rewrote the William Tytler version for his Tales of 
Wonder, 'Courteous King Jamie,' II, 453, No 57, and it was in
this shape that the ballad first came out, 1801.</p>

<p>The story is a variety of that which is found in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_31.html">The Marriage of Sir Gawain</a>,'
and has its parallel, as Scott observed, in an
episode in Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki's saga; <b>A</b>, Torf&aelig;ius,
Historia Hrolfi Krakii, c. vii, Havni&aelig;, 1705; <b>B</b>,
Fornaldar S&ouml;gur, Rafn, I, 30 f, c. 15.</p>

<p>King Helgi, father of Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki, in consequence of a
lamentable misadventure, was living in a solitary way in a
retired lodge. One stormy Yule-night there was a loud wail at the
door, after he had gone to bed. Helgi bethought himself that it
was unkingly of him to leave anything to suffer outside, and got
up and unlocked the door. There he saw a poor tattered creature
of a woman, hideously misshapen, filthy, starved, and frozen
(<b>A</b>), who begged that she might come in. The king took her
in, and bade her get under straw and bearskin to warm herself.
She entreated him to let her come into his bed, and said that her
life depended on his conceding this boon. "It is not what I
wish," replied Helgi, "but if it is as thou sayest, lie here at
the stock, in thy clothes, and it will do me no harm." She got
into the bed, and the king turned to the wall. A light was
burning, and after a while the king took a look over his
shoulder; never had he seen a fairer woman than was lying there,
and not in rags, but in a silk kirtle. The king tUl'l1ec1 towards
her now, and she informed him that his kindness had freed her
from a weird imposed by her stepmother, which she was to be
subject to till some king had admitted her to his bed, <b>A</b>.
She had asked this grace of many, but no one before had been
moved to grant it.</p>

<p>Every point of the Norse saga, except the stepmother's weird,
is found in the Gaelic tale 'Nighean Righ fo Thuinn,' 'The
Daughter of King Under-waves,' Campbell's Popular Tales of the
West Highlands, No lxxxvi, III, 403 f.</p>

<p>The Finn were together one wild night, when there was rain and
snow. An uncouth woman knocked at Fionn's door about midnight,
and cried to him to let her in under cover. "Thou strange, ugly
creature, with thy hair down to thy heels, how canst thou ask <i>me</i>
to let thee in!" he answered. She
<a name="Page_I_298"/>
went away, with a scream, and
the whole scene was repeated with Oisean. Then she came to
Diarmaid. "Thou art hideous," he said, "and thy hair is down to
thy heels, but come in." When she had come in, she told Diarmaid
tbat she bad been travelling over ocean and sea for seven years,
without being housed, till he had admitted her. She asked that
she might come near the fire. "Come," said Diarmaid; but when she
approached everybody retreated, because she was so hideous. She
had not been long at the fire, when she wished to be under
Diarmaid's blanket. "Thou art growing too bold," said he, "but
come." She came under the blanket, and he turned a fold of it
between them. "She was not long thus, when he gave a start, and
he gazed at her, and he saw the finest drop of blood that ever
was, from the beginning of the universe till the end of the
world, at his side."</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell has a fragment of a Gaelic ballad upon this
story, vol. xvii., p. 212 of his manuscript collection, 'Collun
gun Cheann,' or, The Headless Trunk,' twenty-two lines. In this
case, as the title imports, a body without a head replaces the
hideous, dirty, and unkempt draggle-tail who begs shelter of the
Finn successively and obtains her boon only from Diarmaid. See
Campbell's Gaelic Ballads, p. ix.</p>

<p>The monstrous deformity of the woman is a trait in the ballad
of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_31.html">The Marriage of Sir Gawain</a>,' and related stories, and is
described in tbese with revolting details. Her exaggerated
appetite also is found in the romance of The Wedding of Sir Gawen
and Dame Ragnell, see p. 290. The occasion on wbich she exhibits
it is there the wedding feast, and the scene consequently
resembles, even more closely there than here, what we meet with
in the Danish ballads of 'Greve Genselin,' Grundtvig, No 16, I,
222, and 'Tord af Havsgaard,' Grundtvig, No 1, I, 1, IV, 580 (=
Kristensen, 'Thors Hammer,' I, 85, No 35) the latter founded on
the &thorn;rymskvi&eth;a, or Hamarsheimt, of the older Edda. In a
Norwegian version of 'Greve Genselin,' Grundtvig, IV, 732, the
feats of eating and drinking are performed not by the bride, but
by an old woman who acts as bridesmaid,
br&uacute;rekvinne.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d032_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A maid who submits, at a linden-worm's entreaty, to lie in the
same bed with him, finds a king's son by her side in the morning:
Grundtvig, 'Lindormen,' No 65, B, C, II, 213, III, 839;
Kristensen, I, 195, No 71; Afzelius, III, 121, No 88; Arwidsson,
II, 270, No 139; Hazelius, Ur de nordiska Folkens Lif, p. 117,
and p. 149. In 'Ode und de Slang',' M&uuml;llenhoff, Sagen u.s.w.,
p. 383, a maid, without much reluctance, lets a snake
successively come into the house, into her chamber, and finally
into her bed, upon which the snake changes immediately into a
prince.</p>

<p>Scott's copy is translated by Schubart, p. 127, and by
Gerhard, p. 129; Jamieson's, without the interpolations, after
Aytoun, II, 22, by Knortz, Schottische Balladen, No 36.</p>
