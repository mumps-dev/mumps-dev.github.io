<h3>193. The Death of Parcy Reed</h3>

Abbotsford. "Parcy Reed, exactly as it is sung by an old, woman
of the name of Cathrine Hall, living at Fairloans, in the

"There is," says Telfer in his letter, "a place 
in Reed water called Deadwood Haughs, where 
the country-people still point out a stone where 
the unshriven soul of Parcy used to frequent 
in the shape of a blue hawk, and it is only a few 
years since he disappeared... The ballad of 
Parcy Reed has a tune of its own... It is a 
very mournfull air."</td></tr>
