<h3>162. The Hunting of the Cheviot</h3>


<p>P. 306. Fighting on or with stumps, etc.</p>

<p>Ketilbj&ouml;rn's foot is cut off at the ankle-joint. He does
not fall, but hobbles against his enemies and kills two of them
before his strength gives out: Gull-&thorn;&oacute;ris Saga, c.
18, ed. Maurer, p. 75. Gn&uacute;pr fought on his knees after his
foot was off: Vemundar Saga ok V&iacute;gask&uacute;tu, c. 13,
Rafn, &Iacute;slendinga S&ouml;gur, II, 266. S&ouml;rli kills
eleven men with his club, hobbling round on one foot and one
stump (apparently, though S&ouml;rli and H&aacute;rr are perhaps
confused in the narrative): G&ouml;ngu-Hr&oacute;lfs Saga, c. 31,
Rafn, Fornaldar S&ouml;gur, III, 329, &Aacute;smundarson, III,
214 (wrongly, 114). M&aacute;r fights when both his hands are
off: Gull-&thorn;&oacute;ris Saga, c. 10, Maurer, p. 59. Compare
the exploits of S&ouml;lvi after both his hands have been cut
off: G&ouml;ngu-Hr&oacute;lfs Saga, c. 31, Rafn, F. S., III, 331,
&Aacute;smundarson, III, 215 (wrongly 115); and
R&ouml;nd&oacute;lfr's performances after one of his hands has
been cut off and all the toes of one foot, in the same saga, c.
30, Rafn, p. 324 f., &Aacute;smundarson, p. 211 (111); and
G&ouml;ngu-Hr&oacute;lfr's, who has had both feet cut off while
he slept, the same saga, c. 25, Rafn, pp. 307-9,
&Aacute;smundarson, 197 f. The Highlander at the battle of
Gasklune had his predecessor in Ali, in the same saga, c. 30,
Rafn, p. 324, &Aacute;smundarson, p. 210(110). (G.L.K.)</p>
