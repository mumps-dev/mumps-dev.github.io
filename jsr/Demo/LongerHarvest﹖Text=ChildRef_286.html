<p><b>A</b> also in Euing, No 334, Crawford, No 1073, Huth, II,
No 134; all by the same printer, 1682-85.</p>

<p>Motherwell enters the first stanza of another copy of 'The
Turkish Galley' in his Note-Book, p. 10, and refers to three
copies more, besides <b>B</b> <b>d</b>, at p. 51.</p>

<p>There is a retouched copy of <b>C</b> in English County Songs,
Lucy E. Broadwood and J.A. Fuller Maitland, p. 182.</p>

<p><b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, are probably traditional variations of the
broadside <b>A</b>. The conclusion of the broadside is
sufficiently inadequate to impel almost any singer to attempt an
improvement, and a rather more effective catastrophe is the only
signal difference besides names. It is, however, not quite
impossible that the ultimate source of the traditional copies may
be as old as the broadside.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. 'The Sweet Trinity,' a ship built by Sir Walter
Raleigh, has been taken by a galley of a nationality not
specified. The master of some English ship asks what seaman will
take the galley and redeem The Sweet Trinity. A ship-boy asks
what the reward shall be; the reward shall be gold and fee, and
the master's eldest daughter. The ship-boy, who is possessed of
an auger which bores fifteen holes at once, swims to the galley,
sinks her, and releases The Sweet Trinity; then swims back to his
ship and demands his pay. The master will give gold and fee, but
not his daughter to wife. The ship-boy says, Farewell, since you
are not so good as your word.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. No ship has been taken by an enemy. The Golden
Vanity, Golden Victorie, <b>e</b>, falls in with a French galley,
which a cabin-boy undertakes to sink for a reward. The reward is
to be, <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, an estate in the North Country;
<b>c</b>, half the captain's lands in the South Country, meat and
fee, and the captain's eldest daughter; <b>e</b>, gold and fee,
and the captain's daughter. The boy is rolled up in a bull-skin
and thrown over the deck-board (a corruption, see <b>C</b>). He
takes out an instrument, and bores thirty holes at twice,
<b>a</b>; a gimlet, and bores sixty holes and thrice, <b>b</b>;
he struck her with an instrument, bored thirty holes at twice,
<b>c</b>; threescore holes he scuttled in a trice, <b>d</b>;
struck her wi an auger, thirty three and thrice, <b>e</b>. After
sinking the galley he calls to the Golden Vanity to throw him a
rope, take him on board, and be as good as their word, all which
is refused. He threatens to serve them as he has the galley,
<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>d</b>; they take him up and prove better
than their word, <b>a</b>, <b>d</b>, or as good, <b>b</b>. (Of
<b>f</b> very little was remembered by Scott, and the ballad was
besides confounded with 'The George Aloe.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d286_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>)</p>

<p><b>C</b>. The distinguishing feature is that the boy dies
after he is taken up from the water, and is sewed up in a cow's
hide and thrown overboard, 'to go down with the tide.' The Golden
Vanity, <b>a</b>-<b>d</b>, The Gold Pinnatree, <b>e</b>, The
Golden Trinitie, <b>g</b>, is in danger from a Turkish galleon,
<b>a</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>g</b>, a Spanish, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>
(pirate Targalley), <b>d</b>, French, <b>e</b>. The captain of
the English ship promises the cabin-boy gold, fee, and daughter,
if he will sink the enemy. The boy has, and uses, an auger, to
bore two holes at twice, <b>a</b>, that bores twenty holes in
twice, <b>b</b>, to bore two holes at once, <b>c</b>; a case of
instruments, ca's fifty holes and drives them a' at once,
<b>e</b>; an instrument, and bores nine holes in her
water-sluice, <b>f</b>; an auger fitted for the use, and bores in
her bottom a watery sluice, <b>g</b>. The master will not take
him on board, will kill him, shoot him, sink him,
<b>a</b>-<b>d</b>; will not keep his bargain, 'for as you've done
to her, so would you do to me,' <b>e</b> (compare the threat in
<b>B</b> 13). The boy is taken up by his messmates and dies on
the deck, <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>; is sewed in a cow-hide
and thrown overboard, <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>-<b>g</b>; in <b>b</b>
sinks from exhaustion and drowns.</p>
