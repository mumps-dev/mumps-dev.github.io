<p>All the copies here printed are of the seventeenth century,
and the ballad need not be put much beyond that date. Modernized
editions, differing much, were issued in the century following,
perhaps earlier, some of which have a Second Part, narrating the
happy married life of Tom Potts, Lord Arundel, and Fair Rosamund.
See Halliwell's Descriptive Notices of Popular English Histories,
p. 17, No 15, Percy Society, vol. xxiii, and the notes to
<b>B</b>.</p>

<p>Unequal matches are common enough in ballads and romances, and
very naturally, since they are an easy expedient for exciting
interest, at least with those who belong to the humbler party. We
have other ballad-examples of disparagement on the female side in
'The Bonny Foot-Boy' and 'Ritchie Storie.' No offence seems to be
given when King Cophetua weds the Beggar-Maid, but when the Lady
of the Strachy marries the Yeoman of the Wardrobe good taste is
shocked. Such events would be celebrated only by fellows of the
yeoman or of the foot-boy, and surely in the present case the
minstrel was not much above the estate of the serving-man. Lord
Jockey's reckless liberality throughout, and Lord Phenix's in the
end, is a mark of the serving-man's ideal nobleman.</p>

<p>Tom Potts stanches his blood with a charm in <b>A</b>
75<sup>4</sup>, <b>B</b> 82<sup>4</sup>, just as the sons of
Autolycus do that of Ulysses in Odyssey xix, 457 f. His rejecting
of his master's thirty fine horses in favor of the old white
cut-tail is a ludicrous repetition of Hugh Spencer's preference
of the hack he had brought over sea, and Walter of Aquitaine's
predilection for his worn-out charger. See, further on, 'Hugh
Spencer's Feats in France.'</p>

<p>There is a Lord Phenix in a sufficiently absurd ballad in
Motherwell's Manuscript, 'Jamie o Lee,' p. 654; an English
nobleman who steals the Queen of Scotland's jewels and lays the
blame on Jamie o Lee, a page of fifteen years, being himself, for
rhyme's sake, thretty three. The page worsts his accuser in a
duel and makes him confess.</p>

<p>Mr. Macmath notes for me that Swift, in The Tale of a Tub
(written about 1696), having associated Dryden's Hind and Panther
with Tom Thumb, Whittington and his Cat, aud other "prime
productions of our society," adduces Tommy Potts as "another
piece, supposed by the same hand, by way of supple ment to the
former:" Scott's edition, XI, 72.</p>

<p>The message to Strawberry Castle occurs 
also in No 65, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, and No 87 
<b>C</b>.</p>

<p><b>B</b> is translated by Bothe, p. 315.</p>
