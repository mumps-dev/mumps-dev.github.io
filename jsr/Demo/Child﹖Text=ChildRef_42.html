</ol>

<p>Although, as has been already said, William Tytler's Brown
manuscript is now not to be found, a copy of two of its fifteen
ballads has been preserved in the Fraser Tytler family,
<a name="Page_I_372"/>
and
'Clerk Colvill,' <b>A</b> ('Clark Colven') is one of the
two.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d042_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This ballad is not in Jamieson's Brown manuscript.
Rewritten by Lewis, <b>A</b> was published in Tales of Wonder,
1801, II, 445, No 56. <b>B</b>, 1769, is the earliest printed
English copy, but a corresponding Danish ballad antedates its
publication by seventy-five years. Of <b>C</b>, W.F., who
communicated it to Notes and Queries, says: "I have reason to
believe that it is originally from the same source as that from
which Scott, and especially Jamieson, derived many of their best
ballads." This source should be no other than Mrs. Brown, who
certainly may have known two versions of Clerk Colvill; but
<b>C</b> is markedly different from <b>A</b>. An Abbotsford
manuscript, entitled "Scottish Songs," has, at fol. 3, a version
which appears to have been made up from Lewis's copy, its
original, <b>A</b>, and Herd's, <b>B</b>.</p>

<p>All the English versions are deplorably imperfect, and
<b>C</b> is corrupted, besides. The story which they afford is
this. Clerk Colvill, newly married as we may infer, is solemnly
entreated by his gay lady never to go near a well-fared may who
haunts a certain spring or water. It is clear that before his
marriage he had been in the habit of resorting to this mermaid,
as she is afterwards called, and equally clear, from the
impatient answer which he renders his dame, that he means to
visit her again. His coming is hailed with pleasure by the
mermaid, who, in the course of their interview, does something
which gives him a strange pain in the head, &mdash; a pain only
increased by a prescription which she pretends will cure it, and,
as she then exultingly tells him, sure to grow worse until he is
dead. He draws his sword on her, but she merrily springs into the
water. He mounts his horse, rides home tristful, alights heavily,
and bids his mother make his bed, for all is over with him.</p>

<p><b>C</b> is at the beginning blended with verses which belong
to 'Willie and May Margaret,' Jamieson, I, 135 (from Mrs. Brown's
recitation), or 'The Drowned Lovers,' Buchan,I, 140. In this
ballad a mother adjures her son not to go wooing, under pain of
her curse. He goes, nevertheless, and is drowned. It is obvious,
without remark, that the band and belt in <b>C</b> 1 do not suit
the mother; neither does the phrase 'love Colin' in the second
stanza.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d042_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> <b>C</b> 9-11 afford an important variation from the
other versions. The mermaid appears at the foot of the young
man's bed, and offers him a choice between dying then and living
with her in the water. (See the Norwegian ballads at p. 377.)</p>

<p>Clerk Colvill is not, as his representative is or may be in
other ballads, the guiltless and guileless object of the love or
envy of a water-sprite or elf. His relations with the mermaid
began before his marriage with his gay lady, and his death is the
natural penalty of his desertion of the water-nymph; for no point
is better established than the fatal consequences of inconstancy
in such connections.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d042_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> His history, were it fully told, would
closely resemble that of the Knight of Staufenberg, as narrated
in a German poem of about the year 1300.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d042_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The already very distinguished chevalier, Peter Diemringer, of
Staufenberg (in the
<a name="Page_I_373"/>
Ortenau Baden four leagues from Strassburg),
when riding to mass one Whitsunday, saw a lady of surpassing
beauty, dressed with equal magnificence, sitting on a rock by the
wayside. He became instantaneously enamored, and, greeting the
lady in terms, expressive of his admiration, received no
discouraging reply. The lady rose; the knight sprang from his
horse, took a hand which she offered, helped her from the rock,
and they sat down on the grass. The knight asked how she came to
be there alone. The lady replied that she had been waiting for
him: ever since he could bestride a horse she had been devoted to
him; she had been his help and protection in tourneys and fights,
in all climes and regions, though he had never seen her. The
knight wished he might ever be hers. He could have his wish, she
said, and never know trouble or sickness, on one condition, and
that was that he never should marry: if he did this, he would die
in three days. He vowed to be hers as long as he lived; they
exchanged kisses, and then she bade him mount his horse and go to
mass. After the benediction he was to return home, and when he
was alone in his chamber, and wished for her, she would come, and
so always; that privilege God had given her: "sw&acirc; ich wil,
d&acirc; bin ich." They had their meeting when he returned from
church: he redoubled his vows, she promised him all good things,
and the bounties which he received from her overflowed upon all
his friends and comrades.</p>

<p>The knight now undertook a chivalrous tour, to see such parts
of the world as he had not visited before. Wherever he went, the
fair lady had only to be wished for and she was by him: there was
no bound to her love or her gifts. Upon his return he was beset
by relatives and friends, and urged to marry. He put them off
with excuses: he was too young to sacrifice his freedom, and what
not. They returned to the charge before long, and set a wise man
of his kindred at him to beg a boon of him. "Anything," he said,
"but marrying: rather cut me into strips than that," Having
silenced his advisers by this reply, he went to his closet and
wished for his lady. She waS full of sympathy, and thought it
might make his position a little easier if he should tell his
officious friends somethmg of the real case, how he had a wife
who attended him wherever he went and was the source of all his
prosperity; but he must not let them persuade him, or what she
had predicted would surely come to pass.</p>

<p>At this time a king was to be chosen at Frankfurt and all the
nobility flocked thither, and among them Staufenberg, with a
splendid train. He, as usual, was first in all tourneys, and made
himself remarked for his liberal gifts and his generous
consideration of youthful antagonists: his praise was in
everybody's mouth. The king sent for him, and offered him an
orphan niece of eighteen, with a rich dowry. The knight excused
himself as unworthy of such a match. The king said his niece must
accept such a husband as he pleased to give, and many swore that
Staufenberg was a fool. Bishops, who were there in plenty, asked
him if he had a wife already. Staufenberg availed himself of the
leave which had been given him, and told his whole story, not
omitting that he was sure to die in three days if he married.
"Let me see the woman,' said one of the bishops. "She lets nobody
see her but me," answered Staufenberg. "Then it is a devil," said
another of the clergy, "and your soul is lost forever."
Staufenberg yielded, and said he would do the king's will. He was
betrothed that very hour, and set out for Ortenau, where he had
appointed the celebration of the nuptials. When night came he
wished for the invisible lady. She appeared, and told him with
all gentleness that he must prepare for the fate of which she had
forewarned him, a fate seemingly inevitable, and not the
consequence of her resentment. At the wedding feast she would
display her foot in sight of all the guests: when he saw that,
let him send for the priest, The knight thought of what the
clergy had said, and that this might be a cheat of the devil. The
bride was brought to Staufenberg, the feast was held, but at the
very beginning of it a foot whiter than ivory was seen through
the ceiling. Staufenberg tore his hair and cried, Friends, ye have
ruined
<a name="Page_I_374"/>
yourselves and me! He begged his bride and all who had
come with her to the wedding to stay for his funeral, ordered a
bed to be prepared for him and a priest to be sent for. He asked
his brothers to give his bride all that he promised her. But she
said no: his friends should rather have all that she had brought;
she would have no other husband, and since she had been the cause
of his death she would go into a cloister, where no eye should
see her: which she did after she had returned to her own
country.</p>

<p>A superscription to the old poem denominates Staufenberg's
amphibious consort a mer-fey, sea-fairy; but that description is
not to be strictly interpreted, no more than mer-fey, or fata
morgana, is in some other romantic tales. There is nothing of the
water-sprite in her, nor is she spoken of by any such name in the
poem itself. The local legends of sixty years ago,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d042_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and
perhaps still, make her to have been a proper water-nymph. She is
first met with by the young knight near a spring or a brook, and
it is in a piece of water that he finds his death, and that on
the evening of his wedding day.</p>

<p>Clerk Colvill and the mermaid are represented by Sir Oluf and
an elf in Scandinavian ballads to the number of about seventy.
The oldest of these is derived from a Danish manuscript of 1550,
two centuries and a half later than the Staufenberg poem, but two
earlier than Clerk Colvill, the oldest ballad outside of the
Scandinavian series. Five other versions are of the date 1700, or
earlier, the rest from tradition of this century. No ballad has
received more attention from the heroic Danish editor, whose
study of 'Elveskud' presents an admirably ordered synoptic view
of all the versions known up to 1881: Grundtvig, No 47, II,
109-19, 663-66; III, 824-25; IV, 835-74.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d042_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Of these the F&auml;r&ouml;e versions are nearest to the
English. Olaf's mother asks him whither he means to ride; his
corselet is hanging in
<a name="Page_I_375"/>
the loft; <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. "I
am going to tbe heath, to course the hind," he says. "You are not
going to course the hind; you are going to your leman. White is
your shirt, well is it washed, but bloody shall it be when it is
taken off," <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>. "God grant it be not as sbe
bodes!" exclaims Olaf, as he turns from his mother, <b>A</b>. He
rides to the hills and comes to an elf-house. An elf comes out,
braiding her hair, and invites him to dance. "You need not braid
your hair for me; I have not come a-wooing," he says. "I must
quit the company of elves, for to-morrow is my bridal." "If you
will have no more to do with elves, a sick bridegroom shall you
be! Would you rather lie seven years in a sick-bed, or go to the
mould to-morrow?" He would rather go to the mould to-morrow. The
elf brougbt him a drink, with an atter-corn, a poison grain,
floating in it: at the first draught his belt burst <b>A</b>,
<b>B<sup>*</sup></b>. "Kiss me," she said, "before you ride." He
leaned over and kissed her, though little mind had he to it: she
was beguiling him, him so sick a man. His mother came out to meet
him: "Why are you so pale, as if you had been in an elf-dance?" "I
have been in an elf-dance," he said,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d042_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> went to bed, turned his
face to the wall, and was dead before midnight. His mother and
his love (moy, v&iacute;v) died thereupon.</p>

<p>Distinct evidence of previous converse with elves is lacking
in the Icelandic versions. Olaf rides along the cliffs, and comes
upon an elf-house. One elf comes out with her hair twined with
gold, another with a silver tankard, a third in a silver belt,
and a fourth welcomes him by name. "Come into the booth and drink
with us." "I will not live with elves," says Olaf; "rather will I
believe in God." The elf answers that he might do both, excuses
herself for a moment, and comes back in a cloak, which hides a
sword. "You shall not go without giving us a kiss," she says.
Olaf leans over his saddle-bow and kisses her, with but half a
heart, and she thrusts the sword under his shoulder-blade into
the roots of his heart. He sees his heart's blood under his
horse's feet, and spurs home to his mother. "Whence comest thou,
my son, and why so pale, as if thou hadst been in an elf-dance
(leik)?" "It boots not to hide it from thee: an elf has beguiled
me. Make my bed, mother; bandage my side, sister." He dies
presently: there was more mourning than mirth; three were borne
to tbe grave together.</p>

<p>Nearly all the Danish and Swedish versions, and a good number
of the Norwegian, interpose an affecting scene between the death
of the hero and that of his bride and his mother. The bride, on
her way to Olaf's house, and on her arrival, is disconcerted and
alarmed by several ominous proceedings or circumstances. She
hears bells tolling; sees people weeping; sees men come and go,
but not the bridegroom. She is put off for a time with false
explanations, but in the end discovers the awful fact. Such a
passage occurs in the oldest Danish copy, which is also the
oldest known copy of the ballad. The importance of this version
is such that the story requires to be given with some detail.</p>

<p>Oluf rode out before dawn, but it seemed to him bright as
day.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d042_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> He rode to a hill where dwarfs were dancing. A maid
stepped out from the dance, put her arm round his neck, and asked
him whither he would ride. "To talk with my true-love," said he.
"But first," said she, "you must dance with us." She then went on
to make him great offers if he would plight himself to her: a
horse that would go to Rome and back in an hour, and a gold
saddle for it; a new corselet, having which he never need fly
from man; a sword such as never was used in war. Such were all
her benches as if gold Were laid in links, and such
<a name="Page_I_376"/>
were all her
drawbridges as the gold on his hands. "Keep your gold," he
answered; "I will go home to my true-love." She struck him on the
cheek, so that the blood spattered his coat; she struck him
midshoulders, so that he fell to the ground: "Stand up, Oluf, and
ride home; you shall not live more than a day." He turned his
horse, and rode home a shattered man. His mother was at the gate:
"Why comest thou home so sad?" "Dear mother, take my horse; dear
brother, fetch a priest." "Say not so, Oluf; many a sick man does
not die. To whom do you give your betrothed?" "Rise, my seven
brothers, and ride to meet my young bride."</p>

<p>As the bride's train came near the town, they heard the bells
going. "Why is this?" she asked, her heart already heavy with
pain; "I know of no one having been sick." They told her it was a
custom there to receive a bride so. But when she entered the
house, all the women were weeping. "Why are these ladies
weeping?" No one durst answer a word. The bride went on into the
hall, and took her place on the bride-bench. "I see," she said,
"knights go and come, but I see not my lord Oluf." The mother
answered, Oluf is gone to the wood with hawk and hound. "Does he
care more for hawk and hound than for his young bride?"</p>

<p>At evening they lighted the torches as if to conduct the bride
to the bride-bed; but Oluf's page, who followed his lady,
revealed the truth on the way. "My lord," he said, "lies on his
bier above, and you are to give your troth to his brother."
"Never shalt thou see that day that I shall give my troth to two
brothers." She begged the ladies that she might see the dead.
They opened the door; she ran to the bier, threw back the cloth,
kissed the body precipitately; her heart broke in pieces;
grievous was it to see.</p>

<p>Danish <b>B</b>, printed by Syv in 1695, is the copy by which
the ballad of the Elf-shot has become so extensively known since
Herder's time, through his translation and others.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d042_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The principal variations of the Scandinavian ballads, so far
as they have not been given. now remain to be noted.</p>

<p>The hero's name is mostly Oluf, Ole, or a modification of
this, Wolle, Rolig, Volder: sometimes with an appendage, as
F&auml;r&ouml;e &Oacute;lavur Riddarar&oacute;s,
R&oacute;sinkrans, Icelandic &Oacute;lafur Liljur&oacute;s,
Norwegian Olaf Liljukrans, etc. It is Peder in Danish <b>H</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>,
<b>&AElig;</b>.</p>

<p>Excepting the F&auml;r&ouml;e ballads, Oluf is not distinctly
represented as having had previous acquaintance with the elves.
In Swedish <b>A</b> 5 he says, I cannot dance with you, my
betrothed has forbidden me; in Danish <b>C</b>, I should be very
glad if I could; to-morrow is my wedding-day.</p>

<p>The object of his riding out is to hunt, or the like, in
Danish <b>D</b> <b>b</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>R</b>,
<b>T</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>; to bid guests to his wedding,
Danish <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> <b>a</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>K</b>-<b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>,
<b>&Oslash;</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>.</p>

<p>He falls in with dwarfs, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>H</b>, Norwegian
<b>A</b>; trolds, Danish <b>I</b>; elves and dwarfs, Norwegian
<b>B</b>, and a variation of <b>A</b>: elsewhere it is elves.</p>

<p>There is naturally some diversity in the gifts which the elf
offers Oluf in order to induce him to dance with her. He more
commonly replies that the offer is a handsome one, 'kan jeg vel
f&aring;,' but dance with her he cannot; sometimes that his
true-love has already given him that, or two, three, seven such,
Danish <b>D</b> <b>a</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>X</b>,
<b>Y</b>.</p>

<p>If he will not dance with her, the elf threatens him with sore
sickness, Danish <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>Z</b>,
<b>&Oslash;</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, Swedish <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>;
a great misfortune, Danish <b>F</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>; sharp
knives, Danish <b>P</b>; it shall cost him his young life, Danish
<b>D</b> <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>Y</b>.</p>

<p>Oluf dances with the elves, obviously under compulsion, in
Danish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>G</b>-<b>N</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>,
<b>U</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, Swedish <b>F</b>, and only in
these. He dances till
<a name="Page_I_377"/>
both his boots are full of blood, <b>D</b>
<b>a</b> 15, <b>D</b> <b>b</b> 4, <b>G</b> 5, <b>I</b> 11,
<b>K</b> 5, <b>L</b> 5, <b>M</b> 6, <b>N</b> 7, <b>S</b> 6
[shoes], <b>T</b> 10, <b>U</b> 5, <b>X</b> 8, <b>Y</b> 7; he
dances so long that is nigh dead, <b>I</b> 12.</p>

<p>The hard choice between dying at once or lying sick seven
years is found, out of the F&auml;r&ouml;e ballads, only in
Danish <b>H</b> 8, <b>M</b> 8, <b>O</b> 4, <b>Q</b> 2, <b>S</b>
8. Norwegian ballads, like English <b>C</b>, present an option
between living with elves and dying, essentially a repetition of
the terms under which Peter of Staufenberg weds the fairy, that
he shall forfeit his life if he takes a mortal wife. So
Norwegian</p>

<p>may originally have come in before the mermaid and the clerk
parted; but her visit to him as he lies in bed is paralleled by
that of the fairy to Staufenberg after he has been persuaded to
give up what he had been brought to regard as an infernal
<i>liaison</i>; and certainly Clerk Colin's language might lead
us to think that some priest had been with him, too.</p>

<p>Upon Oluf's now seeking to make his escape through the elves'
flame, ring, dance, etc., Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>K</b>, the elf-woman
strikes at him with a gold band, her wand, band, a branch or
twig; gives him a blow on the cheek, between the sboulders, over
his white neck; stabs him in the heart, gives him knife-strokes

<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>R</b>,
<b>V</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>&AElig;</b>, <b>&Oslash;</b>, Swedish
<b>D</b>, <b>G</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>-<b>E</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>I</b>, Icelandic. The knife-stabs are delayed till the elves
have put him on his horse in Danish <b>D</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>X</b>;
as he sprang to his horse the knives rang after him, <b>H</b>.
"Ride home," they say, "you shall not live more than a day" [five
hours, two hours], Danish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>K</b>-<b>N</b>,
<b>S</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>. His hai4 fades, Danish <b>E</b>;
his cheek pales, Danish <b>E</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>; sickness
follows him home, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>;
the blood is running out of the wound in bis heart, Swedish
<b>G</b>; when he reaches his father's house both his boots are
full of blood, Danish <b>R</b>, <b>&AElig;</b>.</p>

<p>His mother [father] is standing without, and asks, Why so
pale? Why runs tbe blood from thy saddle? Oluf, in some
instances, pretends that his horse, not being sure-footed, had
stumbled, and thrown him against a tree, but is told, or of
himself adds, that he has been among the elves. He asks one or
the other of his family to take his horse, bring a priest, make
his bed, put on a bandage. He says he shall never rise from his
bed, Swedish <b>C</b>, Danish <b>F</b>; fears he shall not live
till the priest comes, Danish <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>.</p>

<p>The important passage which relates the arrival of the bride,
the ominous circumstances at the bridegroom's house, the attempts
to keep the bride in ignorance of his death, and her final
discovery that she is widowed before marriage, occupies some
thirty stanzas in
<a name="Page_I_378"/>
Danish <b>A</b>, the oldest of all copies; in
Danish <b>B</b> it is reduced to six; in other Danish versions it
has a range of from fifteen to two; but, shorter or longer, it is
found in all versions but <b>R</b>, <b>&Oslash;</b>, and the
fragments <b>G</b>. <b>L</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Z</b>. All
the Swedish versions have a similar scene, extending from three
to nine stanzas, with the exception of <b>G</b> and of <b>A</b>,
which latter should perhaps be treated as a fragment. In
Norwegian <b>A</b>, again, this part of the story fills ten
stanzas; <b>B</b> lacks it, but <b>C</b>-<b>H</b> (which have not
been published in full) have it, and probably other unpublished
copies.</p>

<p>The bride is expected the next day, Danish <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>,
<b>U</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>. In Danish <b>A</b> Oluf
begs his brotlwrs, shortly after his reaching home, to set out to
meet her; he fears she may arrive that very night, Danish
<b>&AElig;</b>. "What shall I answer your young bride?" asks the
mother, Danish <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, etc., Swedish
<b>H</b>. "Tell her that I have gone to the wood, to hunt and
shoot, to try my horse and my dogs," Danish <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>O</b>,
<b>S</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>U</b>, Swedish <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>,
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>L</b>; in Danish <b>N</b> only, "Say I
died in the night." Oluf now makes his will; he wishes to assign
his bride to his brother, Danish <b>L</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>R</b>,
Norwegian <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>; he dies before the bride can come
to him. (Norwegian <b>F</b> seems to have gone wrong here.)</p>

<p>The bride, with her train, comes in the morning, Danish
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>T</b>,
Swedish <b>D</b>, Norwegian <b>D</b>; Swedish <b>C</b> makes her
wait for her bridegroom several days. As she passes through the
town the bells are tolling, and she anxiously asks why, Danish
<b>A</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>U</b>; she is told
that it is a custom there to ring when the bride comes, Danish
<b>A</b>, Swedish <b>B</b>. In Danish <b>H</b>, though it is day,
she sees a light burning in Oluf's chamber, and this alarms her.
When she comes to the house, Oluf's mother is weeping, all the
ladies are weeping, or there are other signs of grief, Danish
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>&AElig;</b>. When she
asks the reason, no one can answer, or she is told that a woman, a
fair knight, is dead, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>. Now she asks,
Where is Oluf, who should have come to meet me, should have been
here to receive me? Danish <b>K</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>S</b>,
<b>U</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>T</b>. etc. They
conduct the bride into the hall and seat her on the bride bench;
knights come and go; they pour out mead and wine. "Where is
Oluf," she asks again; the mother replies, as best she can, that
Oluf is gone to the wood, Danish <b>B</b>, <b>H</b>, Norwegian
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, Swedish <b>H</b>, etc. "Does he then care
more for that than for his bride?" Danish <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>M</b>, etc., Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, Norwegian
<b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>.</p>

<p>The truth is now avowed that Oluf is dead, Danish <b>A</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>&AElig;</b>, Swedish
<b>B</b>, Norwegian <b>G</b>. The bride begs that she may see the
dead, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>&AElig;</b>,
Swedish <b>F</b>, Norwegian <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, and makes her way
to the room where Oluf is lying. She puts aside the cloths that
cover him, or the curtains, or the flowers, Danish <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>V</b>, etc., Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
Norwegian <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>; says a word or
two to her lover, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>,
Swedish <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, Norwegian <b>G</b>; kisses him,
Danish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>; her heart breaks, Danish
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>; she swoons dead at his feet, Danish <b>K</b>,
<b>M</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>U</b>. In Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, she kills herself with Olaf's sword; in Swedish
<b>E</b>, with her own knife. In Danish <b>R</b> she dies in
Oluf's mother's arms. On the morrow, when it was day, in Oluf's
house three corpses lay: the first was Oluf, the second his maid,
the third his mother, of grief was she dead: Danish, Swedish,

<p>The count [Nann] and his wife were maried at the respective
ages of thirteen and twelve. The next year a son was born [a boy
and girl, <b>D</b>]. The young husband asked the countess if she
had a fancy for anything. She owned that she should like a bit of
game, and he took bis gun [lance] and went to the wood. At the
entrance of the wood he met a fairy [a dwarf, <b>E</b>; a hind,
<b>G</b>; saw a white hind, which he pursued hotly till evening,
when he dismounted near a grotto to drink, and there was a
korrigan, sitting by the spring, combing her hair with a gold
comb, <b>D</b>]. The fairy [dwarf, hind] said that she had long
been looking for him, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>,

"Marry you? Not I. I am married already." "Choose either to die
in three days or to lie sick in bed seven [three] years" [and
then die, <b>C</b>]. He would rather die in three days, for his
wife is very young, and would suffer greatly [he would rather die
that instant than wed a korrigan, <b>D</b>].</p>

<p>On reaching home the young man called to his mother to make
his bed; he should never get up again. [His mother, in <b>C</b>
21, says, Do not weep so: it is not every sick man that dies, as
in Danish <b>A</b> 22.] He recounted his meeting with the fairy,
and begged that his wife might not be informed of his death.</p>

does not come to see me? She was told that he had gone to the
wood to get her something, <b>A</b> [to Paris, <b>C</b>; to the
city, <b>D</b>]. 'Why were the men-servants weeping? The best

<p>The name of the hero in the French ballad is mostly Renaud, or
some modification of Renaud: Jean Renaud, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>U</b>; Renom, <b>AA</b>; Arnaud, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>L</b>,
<b>Y</b>, <b>BB</b>; L'Arnaud l'Infant, <b>P</b>; Louis Renaud,
brother of Jean, <b>F</b>.
<a name="Page_I_381"/>
It is Louis in <b>A</b>, <b>I</b>,
<b>J</b>, <b>V</b>. He is king, or of the royal family, <b>F</b>,
<b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>W</b>, <b>BB</b>,
<b>CC</b>, <b>GG</b>; count, <b>Y</b>; Renaud le grand, <b>H</b>,
<b>Z</b>. In <b>A</b>, while he is walking in his meadows, he
meets Death, who asks him, peremptorily, Would you rather die
this very night, or languish seven years? and he answers that he
prefers to die at once. Here there is a very plain trace of the
older fairy. He is mortally hurt, while hunting, by a wolf,
<b>B</b>; by a boar, <b>DD</b>. But in more than twenty versions
he retnrns from war, often with a horrible wound, "apportant son
c&oelig;ur dans sa main," <b>C</b>; "tenant ses tripes dans ses
mains," <b>N</b>; " oque ses tripes on sa main, sen estoumac on
sen chapea, sen c&ucirc;r covert de sen mentea," <b>G</b>; etc.
In <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b> he comes home in a dying state
from prison (to which he was consigned, according to <b>I</b>,
for robbing a church!). In these versions the story is confused
with that of another ballad, existing in Breton, and very likely
in French, 'Komt ar Chapel,' 'Le Comte des Chapelles,' Luzel, I,
456/457, or 'Le Page de Louis XIII,' Villemarqu&eacute;,
Barzaz-Breiz, p. 301. A fragment of a corresponding Italian
ballad is given by Nigra, Romania, XI, 397, No 9.</p>

<p>Renaud, as it will be convenient to call the hero, coming home
triste et chagrin, <b>F</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>U</b> <b>b</b>,
<b>c</b>, triste et bien malau, <b>Y</b>, receives on his arriving
felicitations from his mother on account of the birth of a son.
He has no heart to respond to these: "Ni de ma femme, ni de mon
fils, je ne saurais me r&eacute;joui." He asks that his bed may
be made, with precautions against his wife's hearing. At midnight
he is dead.</p>

<p>The wife, hearing the men-servants weeping, asks her
mother-in-law the cause. The best horse [horses] has been found
dead in the stable, has strayed away, etc., <b>B</b>,
<b>D</b>-<b>S</b>, <b>GG</b>. "No matter for that," says the
wife; "when Renaud comes he will bring better," <b>B</b>,
<b>D</b>-<b>G</b>, <b>L</b>-<b>Q</b>, <b>GG</b>. The maids are
heard weeping; why is that? They have lost, or injured, sheets in
the washing, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>J</b>.
When Renaud comes we shall have better, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>G</b>. Or a piece of plate has been lost or broken,
<b>A</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>O</b>. [It
is children with the toothache, <b>F</b>, <b>U</b> <b>a</b>,
<b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>]. "What is this chanting which I
hear?" It is a procession, making the tour of the house:
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>-<b>F</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>P</b>-<b>X</b>,
<b>GG</b>. "What gown shall I wear when I go to church?" Black is
the color for women at their churching, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>V</b>,
<b>Y</b>; black is more becoming, plus joli, plus convenant, plus
cons&eacute;quent, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>N</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>BB</b>, <b>DD</b>, <b>GG</b>;
"quittez le ros', quittez le gris, prenez le noir, pour mieux
choisir," etc., <b>Q</b>, <b>W</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>S</b>,
<b>T</b>.</p>

<p>Besides these four questions, all of which occur in Breton
ballads, there are two which are met with in many versions,
always coming before the last. "What is this pounding (frapper,
cogner, taper) which I hear?" It is carpenters, or masons,
repairing some part of the house, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>L</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>-<b>U</b>, <b>W</b>; <b>A</b>,
<b>V</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>AA</b>; <b>GG</b>. "Why are the bells
ringing?" For a procession, or because a distinguished personage
has come, has died, etc., <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>-<b>L</b>,
<b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>W</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>AA</b>, <b>DD</b>,
<b>GG</b>. On the way to church [or cemetery] herdboys or others
say to one another, as the lady goes by, That is the wife of the
king, the seigneur, that was buried last night, or the like; and
the mother-in-law has again to put aside the lady's question as
to what they were saying, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>L</b>-<b>P</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>,
<b>FF</b>, <b>GG</b>.</p>

<p>Flambeaux: or candles are burning at the church, <b>E</b>,
<b>V</b>; a taper is presented to the widow, <b>M</b>, or holy
water, <b>N</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>GG</b>; the church is
hung with black, <b>D</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>FF</b>; the funeral is
going on, <b>AA</b>, <b>CC</b>. "Whose is this new monument?"
"What a fine tomb!" <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>T</b>,
<b>Z</b>, <b>GG</b>. The scene in other cases is transferred to
the cemetery. "Why has the earth been disturbed?" "What new
monument is this?" <b>A</b>, <b>DD</b>; <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>P</b>. In <b>B</b> the tomb is in the
garden; in <b>L</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>BB</b> the place is
not defined.</p>

<p>The young wife utters a piercing shriek, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>. Open earth, split tomb, split
tiles! <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>V</b>,
<b>W</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>; I will stay with my husband, will
die with my husband, will not go back, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>S</b>,
<b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>BB</b>, <b>CC</b>, <b>GG</b>.
She bids her mother take her keys, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>,
<b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>BB</b>, <b>CC</b>,
<b>GG</b>, and commits her son [children] to her
<a name="Page_I_382"/>
kinsfolk, to
bring up piously, <b>B</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>,
<b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>Z</b>, <b>BB</b>, <b>CC</b>. In
<b>H</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>W</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> the
earth opens, and in the last four it encloses her. In <b>K</b>
heaven is rent by her shriek, and she sees her husband in light
(who says, strangely, that his mouth smacks of rot); he bids her
bring up the children as Christians. Heaven opens to her prayer
in <b>AA</b>, and a voice cries, Wife, come up hither! In
<b>GG</b> the voice from heaven says, Go to your child: I will
keep your husband safe. There are other variations.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d042_017','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>G</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>I</b> say expressly that Renaud's wife
died the next day, or after hearing three masses, or soon after.
<b>M</b>, <b>O</b>, by a feeble modern perversion, make her go
into a convent.</p>

<p>Italian ballads cover very much the same ground as the French.
The versions hitherto published are:</p>

<p><b>A</b>. 'La Lavandaia,' Cento, Ferraro, Canti popolari di
Ferrara, Cento e Pontelagoscuro, p. 52, 16 verses, Romania, XI,
397, amended. <b>B</b>. 'Il Cavaliere della bella Spada,'

Conte Cagnolino,' Pontelagoscuro, Ferraro, as above, p. 84,
Rivista di Filologia romanza, II, 196, 36 verses. All these are
from recent tradition.</p>

<p>The name Rinaldo, Rinald, is found only in <b>I</b>, <b>C</b>,
and the latter has also L&uuml;is. L&uuml;is is the name in
<b>E</b>; Carlino, Carlin, in <b>J</b>, <b>H</b>; Angiolino,
Anzolin, <b>L</b>, <b>G</b>; Cagnolino, <b>M</b>. The rank is
king in <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>-<b>K</b>; prince, <b>D</b>;
count <b>G</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>.</p>

<p><b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, corrupted fragments though they be,
retain clear traces of the ancient form of the story, and of the
English variety of that form. Under the bridge of the Rella
[Diamantina] a woman is washing clothes, gh' &egrave; 'na
lavandera. A knight passes, <b>B</b>, and apparently accosts the
laundress. She moves into the water, and the knight after her;
the knight embraces her, <b>A</b>. Dowy rade he hame, el va a
c&agrave; t&uuml;to moj&agrave;, <b>A</b>. In <b>B</b> (passing
over some verses which have intruded) he has many knife-stabs,
and his horse many also.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d042_018','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> He asks his mother to put him to
bed and his horse into the stable, and gives directions about his
funeral.</p>

<p>All of the story which precedes the hero's return home is
either omitted, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>,
or abridged to a single stanza: ven da la cassa lo re Rinald, ven
da la cassa, l'e t&uuml;t fer&igrave;, <b>C</b>; ven da la guerra
re Rinaldo, ven da la guerra, l'e t&uuml;t fer&igrave;, <b>I</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>H</b>; save that <b>G</b>, which like <b>C</b> makes
him to have been hunting (and to have been bitten by a mad dog),
adds that, while he was hunting, his wife had given birth to a
boy. <b>M</b> has an entirely false beginning: Count Cagnolino
was disposed to marry, but wished to be secure about his wife's
previous life. He had a marble statue in his garden which moved
its eyes when any girl that had gone astray presented herself
before it. The
<a name="Page_I_383"/>
daughter of Captain Tartaglia baving been
declined, for reason, and another young woman espoused, Tartaglia
killed the count while they were hunting.</p>

<p>The wounded man, already feeling the approach of death,
<b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>L</b>, asks that his bed may be made; he
shall die before the morrow, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>J</b>; let
not his wife know, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>. The wife asks why the
men-servants, coachmen, are weeping, and is told that they have
drowned [lost] some of the horses, <b>C</b>-<b>J</b>, <b>M</b>
[have burned the king's carriage, <b>K</b>]. We will get others
when the king comes, she answers, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>
[when I get up, <b>F</b>, as in Breton <b>A</b>]. Why are the
maids weeping? The maids have lost sheets or towels in washing,
<b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>; have scorched the shirts in
ironing, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>H</b>. When the king comes, he
will buy or bring better, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>H</b> [when I
get up, <b>F</b>, as in Breton <b>A</b>]. Why are tbe priests
chanting? For a great feast to-morrow, <b>F</b>. Why are the
carpenters at work? They are making a cradle for your boy,
<b>C</b>-<b>E</b>, <b>H</b>-<b>K</b>. Why do the bells ring? A
great lord is dead; in honor of somebody or something; <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>-<b>L</b>. Why does not Anzolin come to see me? He has
gone a-hunting, <b>G</b>, <b>L</b>. What dress shall I put on to
go to church? [When I get up I shall put on red, <b>F</b>,
<b>I</b>.] You in black and I in gray, as in our country is the
way, <b>C</b>-<b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b> [<b>H</b> moda a
<i>Paris</i>, by corruption of d&euml;l pais]; I white, you gray,
<b>J</b>; you will look well in black, <b>M</b>; put on red, or
put on white, or put on black for custom's sake, <b>G</b>. The
children in the street say, That is the wife of the lord who was
buried, or the people look at the lady in a marked way, <b>C</b>,
<b>J</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>M</b>; and why is this? For the last time
the mother-in-law puts off the question. At the church, under the
family bench, there is a grave new made, and now it has to be
said that the husband is buried there, <b>C</b>-<b>K</b>,
<b>M</b>.</p>

<p>A conclusion is wanting in half of the ballads what there is is
corrupted in others. The widow commends her boy to her husband's
mother, <b>G</b>, <b>M</b>, and says she will die with her dear
one, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>M</b>. In <b>C</b>, as in
French <b>V</b>, she wishes to speak to her husband. If the dead
ever spake to the quick, she would speak once to her dear
L&uuml;is; if the quick ever spake to the dead, she would speak
once to her dear husband. In <b>G</b> she bids the grave unlock,
that she may come into the arms of ber beloved, and then bids it
close, that in his arms she may stay: cf. French <b>Y</b>,
<b>Q</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>AA</b>.</p>

<p>The story of the Italian ballad, under the title of 'Il Conte
Angiolino,' was given in epitome by Luigi Carrer, in his Prose e
Poesie, Venice, 1838, IV, 81 f, before any copy had been
published (omitted in later editions). According to Carrer's
version, the lady, hearing bells, and seeing from her windows the
church lighted up as for some office, extracts the fact from her
mother-in-law on the spot, and then, going to the church and
seeing her husband's tomb, prays that it would open and receive
her.</p>

<p>A fragment of an Italian ballad given by Nigra, Romania, XI,
396, No 8, describes three card players, quarrelling over their
game, as passing from words to knives, and from knives to
pistols, and one of the party, the king of Spain, as being
wounded in the fray. He rides home with a depressed air, and asks
his motber to make his bed, for he shall be dead at midnight and
his horse at dawn. There is a confusion of two stories here, as
will be seen from Spanish ballads which are to be spoken of. Both
stories are mixed with the original adventure of the mermaid in
'Il Cavaliere della bella spada,' already referred to as
<b>B</b>. In this last the knight has a hundred and fifty stabs,
and his horse ninety.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d042_019','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Nigra has added to the valuable and beautiful ballads
furnished to Romania, XI, a. tale (p. 398) from the province of
Turin, which preserves the earlier portion of the Breton story. A
hunter comes upon a beautiful woman under a rock. She requires
him to
<a name="Page_I_384"/>
marry her, and is told by the hunter that he is already
married. The beautiful woman, who is of course a fairy, presents
the hunter with a box for his wife, which he is not to open. This
box contains an explosive girdle, intended to be her death; and
the hunter's curiosity impelling him to examine the gift, he is
so much injured by a detonation which follows that be can just
drag himself home to die.</p>

<p><b>Spanish</b>. This ballad is very common in Catalonia, and
has been found in Asturias. Since it is also known in Portugal,
we may presume that it might be recovered in other parts of the
peninsula. <b>A</b>. 'La bona viuda,' Briz, Cansons de la Terra,
III, 155, 32 verses. <b>B</b>. 'La Viuda,' 33 verses, Mil&aacute;
y Fontanals, Romancerillo Catalan, 2d. ed., p. 155, No 204.
<b>C</b>-<b>I</b>. <i>Ib</i>. p. 156 f. <b>J</b>. <i>Ib</i>. p.
157 f, No 204<sub>1</sub>, 36 verses. <b>K</b>. 'Romance de
Do&ntilde;a Ana,' Asturias, the argument only, Amador de los Rios,
Historia Critica de la Literatura Espa&ntilde;ola, VII, 446,
being No 30 of that author's unpublished collection.</p>

<p>The name of the husband is Don Joan de Sevilla, <b>D</b>, Don
Joan, <b>F</b>, Don Olalbo, <b>I</b>, Don Francisco, <b>J</b>,
Don Pedro, <b>K</b>. His wife, a princess, <b>A</b>, <b>G</b>,
has given birth to a child, or is on the eve of so doing. The
gentleman is away from home, or is about to leave home on a
pilgrimage of a year and a day, <b>A</b>, <b>G</b>; has gone to
war, <b>D</b>; to a hunt, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>. He dies just as he
returns home or is leaving home, or away from home, in other
versions, but in <b>K</b> comes back in a dying condition, and
begs that his state may be concealed from his wife. The lady,
hearing a commotion in the house, and asking the cause, is told
that it is the noisy mirth of the servants, <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>.
There is music, chanting, tolling of bells; and this is said to
be for a great person who has died, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>A</b>.
In <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, the wife asks, Can it be for my husband?
In <b>J</b> the mother-in-law explains her own sorrowful demeanor
as occasioned by the death of an uncle, and we are informed that
the burial was without bells, in order that the new mother might
not hear. In <b>J</b> only do we have the question, 'Where is my
husband? He has been summoned to court, says the mother-in-law,
where, as a favorite, he will stay a year an ten days. When
should the young mother go to mass? Peasants go after a
fortnight, tradesfolk after forty days, etc.; she, as a great
lady, will wait a year and a day, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>I</b>. a
year, <b>B</b>, a year and ten days, <b>J</b>. What dress should
she wear, silk, gold tissue, silver? etc. Black would become her
best, <b>A</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>. [Do&ntilde;a Ana, in
<b>K</b>, like the lady in Italian <b>G</b>, resists the
suggestion of mourning, as proper only for a widow, and appears
in a costume de Pascua florida: in some other copies also she
seems to wear a gay dress.] The people, the children, point to
her, and say, There is the widow. and her mother-in-law parries
the inquiry why she is the object of remark; but the truth is
avowed when they see a grave digging, and the wife asks for whom
it is, <b>A</b>. In <b>J</b> the lady sees a monument in the
church, hung with black, reads her husband's name, and swoons.
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b> make the mother's explanation follow upon the
children's talk. In <b>K</b> the announcement is made first by a
shepherd, then confirmed by gaping spectators and by a rejected
lover. The widow commends her child to its grandmother, and says
she will go to her husband in heaven, <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>; dies on
the spot, <b>K</b>; Don Francisco dies in March, Do&ntilde;a Ana
in May, <b>J</b>.</p>

<p>'Don Joan y Don Ramon' is a ballad in which a young man
returns to his mother mortally wounded, and therefore would be
likely to blend in the memory of reciters with any other ballad
in which the same incident occurred. A version from the Balearic
Islands may be put first, which has not yet taken up any
characteristic part of the story of Renaud: Recuerdos y Bellezas
de Espa&ntilde;a, Mallorca, p. 336, 1842 = Mil&aacute;, 1853, p.
114, No 15, Briz, III, 172; Die Balearen in Wort und Bild
geschildert, by the Archduke Ludwig Salvator, Leipzig, 1871, II,
556.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d042_020','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Don Joan and Don Ramon are returning from the chase. Don Ramon
falls from his horse;
<a name="Page_I_385"/>
Don Joan rides off. Don Ramon's mother sees
her son coming through a field, gathering plants to heal his
wounds. "What is the matter?" she asks; "you are pale." "I have
been bled, and they made a mistake." " Ill luck to the barber!"
"Curse him not; it is the last time. Between me and my horse we
have nine and twenty lance thrusts; the horse has nine and I the
rest. The horse will die tonight and I in the morning. Bury him
in the best place in the stable, and me in St. Eulalia; lay a
sword crosswise over my grave, and if it is asked who killed me,
let the answer be, Don Joan de la cassada."</p>

<p>There are numerous Catalan versions, and most of them add
something to this story: Mil&aacute;, 2d ed., 'El guerrero mal
herido,' p. 171, No 210, <b>A</b>-<b>F</b>,
<b>A<sub>1</sub></b>,<b>G<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>A<sub>11</sub></b>;
Briz, III, 171 f, two copies. These disagree considerably as to
the cause of the hero's death, and the names are not constant. In
<b>A<sub>1</sub></b> of Mil&aacute;, as in the Balearic ballad,
Don Joan and Don Ramon are coming from the chase, and have a
passage at lances; Don Joan is left dead, and Don Ramon is little
short of it. <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, of Mil&aacute;, tell us that Don
Pedro died on the field of battle and Don Joan came home mortally
wounded. <b>E</b> says that Don Joan and Don Ramon come from the
chase, but Don Joan immediately, says that he comes from a great
battle. It is battle in <b>F<sub>1</sub></b>, in
<b>E<sub>1</sub></b> (with Gast&oacute; returning), and in both
the Catalan copies of Briz, the hero being DOn Joan in the first
of these last, and in the other nameless. The wounded man says he
has been badly bled, Mil&aacute;, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>A<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>C<sub>1</sub></b>, Briz 2; he and his
horse have lance wounds fifty-nine, thirty-nine, twenty-nine,
etc., the horse nine and he the rest, Mil&aacute;, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>A<sub>1</sub></b>, Briz 1. His mother
informs him that his wife has borne a child, "a boy like the
morning star," Briz. 1, and says that if he will go to the best
chamber he will find her surrounded by dames and ladies. This
gives him no pleasure; he does not care for wife, nor dames, nor
ladies, nor boys, nor morning stars: Briz 1, Mil&aacute;,
<b>A<sub>1</sub></b>-<b>G<sub>1</sub></b>. He asks to have his
bed made, Mil&aacute;, <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>, <b>B<sub>1</sub></b>,
<b>C<sub>1</sub></b>, Briz 1, 2, for he shall die at midnight and
his horse at dawn, <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>, <b>A<sub>1</sub></b>, Briz
2, and gives directions for his burial and that of his horse. Let
the bells toll when he is dead, and when people ask for whom it
is, the answer will be, For Don Joan, Briz 1, Gast&oacute;,
Mil&aacute;, <b>E<sub>1</sub></b>, who was killed in battle. Let
his arms be put over the place where his horse is buried, and
when people ask whose arms they are his mother will say, My
son's, who died in battle, Mil&aacute; <b>A</b>,

<p>We have, probably, to do with two different ballads here,
versions <b>A</b>-<b>F</b> of Mil&aacute;'s 'Guerrero mal
herido,' and Briz's second, belonging with 'Don Joan y Don
Ramon,' while <b>A<sub>1</sub></b>-<b>G<sub>1</sub></b> of
Mil&aacute;, and Briz's first, represent a ballad of the Renaud
class. It is, however, possible that the first series may be
imperfect copies of the second.</p>

<p>'Don Joan y Don Ramon' has agreements with Italian <b>B</b>,
<b>A</b>: in <b>B</b>, particularly, we note the hundred and
fifty stabs of the knight and the ninety of his horse.</p>

<p><b>Portuguese</b>. A good Portuguese version, 'D. Pedro e D.
Leonarda,' in fifty short verses, unfortunately lacking the
conclusion, has been lately communicated to Romania. (XI, 585) by
Leite de Vasconcellos. Dom Pedro went hunting, to be gone a year
and a day, but was compelled to return home owing to a malady
which seized him. His mother greets him with the information that
his wife has given birth to a son. "Comfort and cheer her," he
says, "and for me make a bed, which I shall never rise from." The
wife asks, Where is my husband, that he does not come to see me?
"He has gone a-hunting for a year and a day," replies the mother.
What is this commotion in the house? "Only visitors." But the
bells are tolling! Could it be for my husband? "No, no; it is for
a feast-day." When do women go to mass after child-birth? "Some
in three weeks and some in two, but a lady of your rank after a
year and a day." And what color do they
<a name="Page_I_386"/>
wear? "Some light blue
and some a thousand wonders, but you, as a lady of rank, will go
in mourning." The ballad stops abruptly with a half-pettish,
half-humorous imprecation from the daughter-in-law against the
mother for keeping her shut up so long.</p>

<p>There is a Slavic ballad, which, like the versions that are so
popular with the Romance nations, abridges the first part of the
story, and makes the interest turn upon the gradual discovery of
the hero's death, but in other respects agrees with northern
tradition.</p>

<p>The hero on his wedding day is making ready his horse to fetch
the bride; for he is, as in the Scandinavian ballads, not yet a
married man. His mother, Bohemian <b>A</b>, ascertaining his
intention, begs him not to go himself with the bridal escort.
Obviously she has a premonition of misfortune. Herman will never
invite guests, and not go for them. The mother, in an access of
passion, exclaims, If you go, may you break your neck, and never
come back! Here we are reminded of the F&auml;r&ouml;e ballad.
Bohemian <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> make the forebodings to rise in
Herman's mind, not in his mother's. The mother opposes the match
in Bohemian <b>E</b>, and the sister wishes that he may break his
neck. Wendish <b>A</b> has nothing of opposition or bodement
before the start, but the crows go winging about the young men
who are going for the bride, and caw a horrible song, how the
bridegroom shall fall from his horse and break his neck. The train
sets off with a band of trumpets, drums, and stringed
instruments, or, Bohemian <b>D</b>, with a discharge of a hundred
muskets, and when they come to a linden in a meadow Herman's
horse "breaks his foot," and the rider his neck; Bohemian
<b>D</b>, when they come to a copse in a meadow the hundred
pieces are again discharged, and Herman is mortally wounded. His
friends stand debating what they shall do. The dying man bids
them keep on: since the bride cannot be his, she shall be his
youngest brother's, Bohemian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>; cf. Danish
<b>L</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>R</b>, Norwegian <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>. The
train arrives at the bride's house; the bride comes out to greet
them, but, not seeing the bridegroom, inquires affrightedly what
has become of him. They pretend that he has remained at home to
see to the tables. The mother is reluctant to give them the
bride, but finally yields. When the train comes again to the
linden in the mead, Dorothy sees blood. It is Herman's! she
cries; but they assure her that it is the blood of a deer that
Herman had killed for the feast. They reach Herman's house, where
the bride has an appalling reception, which need not be
particularized.</p>

<p>In Bohemian <b>A</b>, while they are at supper (or at half-eve
= three in the afternoon), a death-bell is heard. Dorothy turns
pale. For whom are they tolling? Surely it is for Herman. They
tell her that Herman is lying in his room with a bad headache,
and that the bell is ringing for a child. But she guesses the
truth, sinks down and dies, <b>a</b>. She wears two knives in her
hair, and thrusts one of them into her heart, <b>b</b> . The two
are buried in one grave. In Bohemian <b>B</b> the bell sounds for
the first time as the first course is brought on, and a second
time when the second course comes. The bride is told in each case
that the knell is for a child. Upon the third sounding, when the
third course is brought in, they tell her that it is for Herman.
She seizes two knives and runs to the graveyard: with one she
digs herself a grave, and with the other stabs herself. In the
Wendish fragment <b>B</b>, at the first and second course (there
is no bell) the bride asks where the bridegroom is, and at the
third repeats the question with tears. She is told that he is
ranging the woods, killing game for his wedding. In
<a name="Page_I_387"/>
Bohemian
<b>C</b> the bell tolls while they are getting the table ready.
The bride asks if it is for Herman, and is told that it is for a
child. When they sit down to table, the bells toll again. For
whom should this be? For whom but Herman? She springs out of the
window, and the catastrophe is the same as in Bohemian <b>B</b>.
In <b>D</b> the bride hears the bell as the train is approaching
the house, and they say it is for a child. On entering the court
she asks where Herman is. He is in the cellar drawing wine for
his guests. She asks again for Herman as the company sits down to
table, and the answer is, In the chamber, lying in a coffin. She
springs from the table and rushes to the chamber, seizing two
golden knives, one of which she plunges into her heart. In
Bohemian <b>E</b>, when the bride arrives at John the
bridegroom's house, and asks where he is, they tell her she had
better go to bed till midnight. The moment she touches John she
springs out of bed, and cries, Dear people, why have ye laid a
living woman with a dead man? They stand, saying, What shall we
give her, a white cap or a green chaplet? "I have not deserved
the white (widow's) cap," she says; "I have deserved a green
chaplet." In Wendish <b>A</b>, when the bell first knolls, the
bride asks, Where is the bridegroom? and they answer, In the new
chamber, putting on his fine clothes. A second toll evokes a
second inquiry; and they say he is in the new room, putting on
his sword. The third time they conceal nothing: He fell off his
horse and broke his neck. "Then tear off my fine clothes and
dress me in white, that I may mourn a year and a day, and go to
church in a green chaplet, and never forget him that loved me!"
It will be remembered that the bride takes her own life in
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, and in Swedish <b>E</b>,
as she does in Bohemian <b>A</b> <b>b</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>.</p>
