<h3>78. The Unquiet Grave</h3>


<p>P. 236 b. Add: Waldau's B&ouml;hmische Granaten, II, 121, No
176.</p>

<p>236 f., III, 512 f. The Rev. S. Baring-Gould has recovered
several copies of 'The Unquiet Grave' in the West Country. It
will be observed that the variations in this ballad do not take a
wide range. The verses are not always sung in the same order;
there is not story enough to keep them in place. Mr. Baring-Gould
informs me that there is a Devon popular tale which is very
similar (possibly a prose version of the ballad). In this, a
bramble-leaf comes between the lips of the maiden and her dead
lover, and her life is saved thereby. This tale is utilized in
the ballad as printed in Songs of the West, No 6, 'Cold blows the
wind, sweetheart!'</p>

<h3>H</h3>

<li>Sent Rev. S. Baring-Gould by Mrs. Gibbons, daughter
of the late Sir W.L. Trelawney, as she remembered it sung by her
nurse, Elizabeth Doidge, a woman of the neighborhood of Brentor,
about 1828.</li>
<li>Obtained by the same from John Woodrich,
blacksmith, parish of Thrustleton, as heard from his grandmother
about 1848.</li>

<p>'Charles Graeme,' Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland,
I, 89, Motherwell's Manuscript, p. 624, begins with stanzas which
belong to this ballad. What follows after the third, or just
possibly the sixth, stanza reads as if some contributor had been
diverting himself with an imposition on the editor's simplicity.
Buchan himself remarks in a note, p. 299: "There seems to be a
very great inconsistency manifested throughout the whole of this
ballad in the lady's behavior towards the ghost of her departed
lover. Perhaps she wished to sit and sigh alone, undisturbed with
visits from the inhabitants of the grave." (Translated by
Gerhard, p. 63.)</p>
