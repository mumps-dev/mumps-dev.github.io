<h3>Young Andrew</h3>

<a name="Page_I_432"/>
<ol type="A">
<li>Percy Manuscript, p. 292. Hales and Fnrnivall, II, 328. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d04801.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>'Young Andrew' is known only from the Percy manuscript. The
story recalls both '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_4.html">Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight</a>,' No 4, and,
The Fair Flower of Northumberland,' No 9. The lady, Helen, 258,
is bidden to take, and does take, gold with her in stanzas 5-7,
as in No 4, English <b>E</b> 2, 3, <b>D</b> 7, Danish <b>A</b>
12, <b>E</b> 7, 9, <b>I</b> 5, <b>L</b> 5, 6, and nearly all the
Polish copies, and again in No 9, <b>A</b> 14. She is stripped of
her clothes and head-gear in 8-17, as in No 4, English
<b>C</b>-<b>E</b>, German <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, and many of the
Polish versions. These are destined by Young Andrew for his lady
("that dwells so far in a strange country") in 10, 12, 14, as by
Ulinger for his sister, and by Adelger for his mother, in German
<b>G</b> 18, <b>H</b> 15. In 15 the lady entreats Young Andrew to
leave her her smock; so in No 4, Polish <b>L</b> 8, "You brought
me from home in a green gown; take me back in a shift of tow,"
and <b>R</b> 13, "You took me away in red satin; let me go back at
least in a smock." 18 has the choice between dying and going home
again which is presented in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_261.html">Lady Isabel</a>,' Polish <b>AA</b> 4,
<b>H</b> 10, <b>R</b> 11, and implied in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_9.html">The Fair Flower of Northumberland</a>,'
<b>D</b> 2-5; in <b>A</b> 25 of this last the
choice is between dying and being a paramour. In 20, 21, the lady
says, "If my father ever catches you, you're sure to flower a
gallows-tree," etc.; in No 4, Polish <b>J</b> 5, "If God would
grant me to reach the other bank, you know, wretch, what death
you would die." The father is unrelenting in this ballad, v. 26,
and receives his daughter with severity in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_9.html">The Fair Flower of Northumberland</a>,'
<b>B</b> 13, <b>C</b> 13. The conclusion of
'Young Andrew' is mutilated and hard to make out. He seems to
have been pursued and caught, as John is in the Polish ballads,
<b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>T</b>, etc., of No 4. Why he was not
promptly disposed of, and how the wolf comes into the story, will
probably never be known.</p>
