<p>The three stanzas cited by Motherwell, Minstrelsy,
Introduction, p. lxviii, note 15 (wrongly as to 2<sup>4</sup>),
and repeated from Motherwell by Chambers, p. 310, Whitelaw, p.
81, Aytoun, II, 342, are from <b>B</b> <b>a</b>.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. The heir of Linne, a Scots lord, took to cards,
dice, and wine, sold his lands to John o the Scales, and went on
in dissolute ways for three fourths of a year longer; then he was
forced to go to Edinburgh and beg his bread. Some gave him, some
refused him, some bade him go to the devil. Brooding over his
destitution, he remembered that his father had left him a paper
which he was not to look into till he should be in extreme need.
This paper told him of a castle wall in which stood three chests
of money. Filling three bags with gold, he went to John o
Scales's house. John's wife wished herself a curse if she trusted
him a penny. One good fellow in the company offered to lend him
forty pence, and forty more, if wanted. John o Scales tendered
him his lands back for twenty pounds less than they had been sold
for. The heir of Linne called the lords present to witness, threw
John a penny to bind the bargain, and counted out the money from
his bags. Then he gave the good fellow forty pounds, and made him
keeper of his forest, and beshrewed himself if ever he put his
lands in jeopardy again.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. The heir of Linne stands at his father's gates, and
nobody asks him in. He is hungry, wet, and cold. As he goes down
the town, gentlemen are drinking. Some say, Give him a glass;
some say, Give him none. As he goes up the town, fishermen are
sitting. Some say, Give him a fish; some say, Give him a fin. He
takes the road to Linne,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d267_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and on the way begs of his nurse a
slice of bread and a bottle of wine, promising to pay them back
when he is laird of Linne; which he will never be, she says. A
score of nobles are dining at Linne. Some say, Give him beef,
some say, Give him the bone; some say, Give him nothing at all.
The new laird will let him have a sip, and then he may go his
gate. At his wits' end, he now recalls a little key given him by
his mother before she died, which he was to keep till he was in
his greatest need. This key fits a little door somewhere in the
castle. He gets gold enough to free his lands. He returns to the
company of nobles. The new laird offers him Linne back for a
third of what had been paid for it. He takes the guests to
witness, and tells the money down on a table. He pays the nurse
for her bread and wine. His hose had been down at his ankles; now
he has fifteen lords to escort him.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d267_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Percy, Reliques, 1765, II, 309, 1794, II, 128 (with some
readings of his manuscript restored in the later edition), as he
puts it, revised and completed <b>A</b> by "the insertion of
supplemental stanzas," "suggested by a modern ballad on a similar
subject." In fact, Percy made a new ballad,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d267_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and a very good
one, which, since his day, has passed for 'The Heir of Linne.'
(Herd, 1769, p. 227, but afterwards dropped; Ritson, Scotish
Songs, II, 129; Ritson, Ancient Songs and Ballads, 1829, II, 81,
with a protest; even Chambers, p. 310, Aytoun, II, 342; for the
Scottish version had not been printed when these collections
appeared.)</p>

<p>The modern ballad on a similar subject used by Percy was 'The
Drunkard's Legacy,'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d267_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> an inexpressibly pitiable ditty, from
which Percy did not and could not take a line, but only, as he
says, a suggestion for the improvement of the story. In this, a
gentleman has a thriftless son given over to gaming and
drunkenness. The father, foreseeing his ruin, builds a cottage on
a waste plat of land, with one door, fastened by a spring-lock.
On his death-bed he sends for his son, tells him of the cottage,
and directs him, after he has lost all his friends and pawned his
lands, to break open the door, for he shall find something within
to end his troubles. After the father's death the son spent all
his ready money, and then pawned his lands to the keeper of a
tavern which he had frequented, who, in the end, kicked him out
of doors. Recalling now his father's injunction, the son broke
open the cottage, hoping to find money. He saw only 'a gibbet and
a rope,' and a stool under the rope. He mounted the stool, put
the rope round his neck, and jumped off. The ' gibbet ' broke,
and a thousand pound in gold came tumbling about his ears. The
young man, with a blessing on his father, vowed to give up
drinking. He went to the vintner's, and getting a rough
reception, complained of his so treating a man who had pawned to
him for three hundred pounds lands bringing in eight score
pounds' rent, and besides had spent the money in that shop. The
vintner told him to bring a hundred pounds the next day and take
the lands back. The young man asked a note to this effect, which
was unsuspectingly given. He then went and fetched the money,
bringing with him a comrade, 'who had made him drink when
moneyless.' The vintner declared that he had spoken in jest, but
'this young man's friend' urged that the written agreement would
'cast' him in law; so the vintner had to take the hundred pounds
and give up the deeds, and he cut his throat for mortification.
From that time the prodigal lived a sober, charitable life.</p>

<p>Percy's introduction of the lonesome lodge, the hanging, the
bursting ceiling, and the father's double admonition, is an
improvement too striking to require or bear much comment. It is
very far from certain that a young reprobate, who has spent
everything in riotous living, will be turned into better courses
by simply coming upon more money, as in the traditional ballad;
whereas there is a very fair chance that the moral shock received
in the other might be efficacious.</p>

<p>There are several Oriental stories which closely resemble that
of 'The Drunkard's Legacy,' or of Percy's 'Heir of Linne.'</p>

<p>(1.) Sinadab was left by his father's will free to dispose of
a large property, with the exception of a diminutive garden, at
the end of which was a small house. This he was on no account to
part with. He indulged in reckless profusion, and in about two
years everything was spent. The friends of his affluent days
abandoned him, all but one, who gave him ten sequins. With only
this in hand he set out on a voyage which led to adventures which
may be passed over. They ended in his coming again to extreme
poverty. He then remembered the little garden which he had been
forbidden to sell. He found a small box in the house, and eagerly
broke it open. There was nothing in it but a rope, with a writing
in his father's hand, rebuking him for his dissipation, and
suggesting that, if he had sufficient resolution, he might put an
end to his troubles by use of the rope. Sinadab accordingly got
up on a stool, fastened the rope to the ceiling, adjusted a noose
about his neck, and pushed back the stool. The ceiling gave way,
and he was covered with a shower of gold pieces, which proved to
be only a trifling part of riches concealed above. His career
after this was serious and prudent. Gueulette, 'Les mille et un
quart d'heure,' Contes Tartares, Cabinet des Fe*es, XXI, 66-70,
89-93.</p>

<p>(2.) <b>Turkish</b>. A merchant took his son to a certain
house, and said, If you waste the wealth I leave, do not beg, but
get a rope and hang yourself from this ring. The son squandered
his inheritance with sycophants, who reviled him after he was
stripped. He got a rope, went to the house, mounted a stool,
fastened one end of the rope to the ring, the other about his
neck, and threw himself from the stool. A board in which the ring
was fastened gave way, the young man fell to the ground, and gold
and jewels came pouring upon him. He repented of his profligacy,
and reformed his ways. 'The Forty Vezirs,' Gibb, p. 244;
Behrnauer, p. 253.</p>

<p>(3.) <b>Arabic</b>. A man charged his son not to beg if he
should come to want, for he had hidden a treasure in his house,
which, however, he was not to resort to until compelled by dire
necessity. After his father's death, the son, without delay,
broke into the place where the treasure had been said to be
concealed, but found only an empty room, with a rope hanging from
the ceiling. Under the rope was a pile of bricks, and a paper
recommending him to get up on the bricks and hang himself. The
young man went off, and with the assistance of parasites, was
soon rid of all his wealth. After a taste of the sharpness of
poverty and of the baseness of summer friends, he went to the
room where he had expected to find the treasure, stepped on the
pile of bricks, tied the rope round his neck, and kicked away the
bricks. The rope parted, and a quantity of precious things
tumbled from overhead. His false friends promptly returned with
prosperity, but were put to shame. Tausend und eine Nacht,
Deutsch von Habicht, v. d. Hagen u. Schall, 1840, XIV, 65-68.</p>

<p>(4.) The same story, with some of the details of both 2 and 3,
in Pauli's Schimpf und Ernst, Oesterley, p. 400, from the edition
of 1533. In Pauli's tale, the young man, after a year of
exemplary life in the world, gives all his goods to the poor and
turns hermit.</p>

<p>(5.) <b>Persian</b>. Atalmulc's extravagances cause his father
great anxiety. The father, when near his end, charges his son, if
he should be so unhappy as to dissipate the fortune he will
receive, to hang himself to a branch of a tree in the middle of
the garden. The bough breaks, and the trunk is found to be full
of precious stones. Petis de la Croix, Les Mille et un Jour,
Cabinet des F&eacute;es, XIV, 457.</p>

<p>There is another and seemingly an independent story,
summarized in two distichs in the Greek Anthology (IX, 44, 45,
translated by Ausonius, Epigrammata, 22, 23), how a man, who was
about to hang himself, found some money, and left his rope
behind, and how the owner of the money, coming for it and not
finding it, hanged himself with the rope.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d267_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> La Fontaine's
fable, 'Le Tr&eacute;sor et les deux Hommes,' IX, 16, is this
story, with a wall falling, not by precontrivance, but from its
ruinous condition.</p>

<p>The eighth tale in the ninth decade of Giraldi Cinthio's
Hecatommithi, 1565, II, 563, is a modification of what may be
called the Greek story. "Chera hid a treasure. Elisa, going about
to hang herself, and tying the halter about a beam, found that
treasure, and in place thereof left the halter. Philene, the
daughter of Chera, going for that treasure, and busily searching
for the same, found the halter, wherewithal, in despair, she
would have hanged herself, but," etc. (Painter's argument to his
translation of Cinthio's tale in the Palace of Pleasure, 2d Tome
(1567), 11th novel, ed. Jacobs, II, 264.)</p>

<p>The Greek Syntipas has another variety. A man, reduced to
want, takes a sword and goes to a lonely place to end his misery.
He finds in a deep hole or fosse a quantity of gold which has
been hidden there by a cyclops, takes it, and goes back to his
house very happy. The cyclops, coming to the spot and not finding
his gold, but seeing the sword lying about, slays himself.
Matth&aelig;i, Syntip&aelig; Fabul&aelig;, 1781, p. 38,
#956;&#951;; Coray, &AElig;sop, p. 246, No 384.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d267_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A tale in Anv&aacute;r-i Suhail&iacute; has been cited in
connection with the foregoing, which has only a general and
remote resemblance to 'The Heir of Linne.' A wise king,
perceiving that his two unpromising sons would misuse his
treasures, buries them in a hermitage. After his death, his sons
quarrel about the succession. The younger is worsted, and brought
so low that he abandons the world, and selects this hermitage for
his retirement. Here he learns wisdom that is better than riches,
and also discovers the buried treasure. Both the elder brother
and a king with whom he is at variance are killed in a fight, and
the younger is offered a double kingdom. (Chapter I, story II,
Eastwick, p. 74; also, Contes et Fables Indiennes de Bidpa&iuml;
et de Lokman (Galland), Cabinet des F&eacute;es, XVII, 122; The
Fables of Pilpay, London, 1818, p. 51.)</p>

<p>Percy's ballad is translated by Bodmer, II, 117, and by
Knortz, Lieder und Romanzen Alt-Englands, p. 78.</p>
