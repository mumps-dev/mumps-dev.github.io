<p>Bulgarian ballad. &mdash; Stojan is married on Sunday, on
Monday he is ordered to join the army. His wife gives him a posy,
which will remain fresh until she marries another man. He serves
nine years; the tenth the queen discovers from his talk that he
has a wife, and gives him permission to go home. He arrives the
very day on which his wife is to be remarried, goes to the
wedding, and asks her to kiss his hand and accept a gift from
him. She recognizes him by the ring on his hand, sends off the
guests, and goes home with him. Collection of the Ministry of
Instruction, I, 39. In a variant, Verkovi&#263;, p. 329, No 301,
the man is gone three years, and arrives just as the wedding
procession comes for the bride. (W.W.)</p>

<p>206. <b>H</b>. I have received from Mr. Walker, of Aberdeen,
author of 'The Bards of Bonaccord,' a copy of 'Hind Horn' which
was taken down by a correspondent of his on lower Deeside about
1880. It closely resembles <b>G</b> and <b>H</b>. Collated with
<b>H</b>, the more noteworthy variations are as follows:</p>

belonged to 'The Kitchie-Boy,' 'Bonny Foot-Boy,' No 252. Cf.
<b>A</b> 34, 35, <b>B</b> 47, <b>D</b> 7, 8, of that ballad.</p>
