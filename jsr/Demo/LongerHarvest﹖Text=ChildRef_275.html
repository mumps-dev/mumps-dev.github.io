<p><b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. A housewife is boiling puddings anight; a
cold wind blows in, and her husband bids her bar the door; she
has her hands in her work and will not. They come to an agreement
that whoever speaks first shall bar the door. Two belated
travellers are guided to the house by the light which streams
through an opening. They come in, and, getting no reply to their
questions or response to their greetings, fall to eating and
drinking what they find; the goodwife thinks much, but says
naught. One of the strangers proposes to the other to take off
the man's beard, and he himself will kiss the goodwife. Hot water
is wanting (for scalding), suggests the second; but the boiling
pudding-bree will serve, answers the first. The goodman calls
out, Will ye kiss my wife and scald me? and having spoken the
first word has to bar the door.</p>

<p><b>C</b>. In <b>C</b> man and wife are in bed, and the
travellers haul the woman out and lay her on the floor: this
makes the husband give tongue.</p>

<p>Stenhouse notes that this ballad furnished Prince Hoare with
the principal scene in his musical entertainment of "No Song, no
Supper," produced in 1790, and long a favorite on the stage.
(Musical Museum, 1853, IV, 292.)</p>

<p>This tale is one of a group which may or may not have had a
single archetype. Of the varieties, that which comes nearest is
the first story in Straparola's Eighth Day. Husband and wife are
sitting near the entrance of their house one night; the husband
says, It is time to go to bed, shut the door; she says, Shut it
yourself. They make a compact that the one who speaks first shall
shut the door. The wife, tired of silence and growing sleepy,
goes to bed; the husband stretches himself on a bench. A
gentleman's servant, whose lantern has been put out by the wind,
seeing the door open, asks for a light. There is no reply.
Advancing a little way into the house, he finds the man lying on
the bench with his eyes open, but can get no word from him though
he shakes him. Looking round, he sees the woman in bed and
addresses her, but she is as dumb as her husband; he gets into
the bed. The woman says nothing till the intruder goes away; then
calls out, A pretty man you, to leave the door open all night and
let people get into your bed. Fool, he says, now go shut the
door. The same, with insignificant divergences, in L'&Eacute;lite
des Contes du Sieur d'Ouville, Rouen, 1699, I, 159.</p>

<p>A wedding-feast over, neither bridegroom nor bride will
consent to shut the street-door; the lady proposes that the one
who speaks first shall do this, to which the bridegroom agrees.
They sit looking at each other in silence for two hours. Thieves,
seeing the door open, come in, pillage the house, and even strip
the young pair of everything valuable that they have on them, but
neither says a word. In the morning a patrol of police find the
house door open, enter, and make an inspection. The chief demands
an explanation of the state of things; neither man nor woman
vouchsafes a response, and he orders their heads off. The
executioner is beginning with the husband; the wife cries out,
Spare him! the husband exclaims, You have lost, go shut the door.
(The Arabian tale of Sulayman Bey and the Three Story-Tellers,
cited by Clouston, Popular Tales and Fictions, II, 29.)</p>

<p>Hemp-eaters, who have found a sequin and bought a mass of
food, quarrel about fastening the gate of a tomb to which they
have retired, to gorge unmolested. They come to an agreement that
the man who first speaks shall close the gate. They let the
victuals stand and sit mute. A troop of dogs rush in and eat all
up clean. One of the party had secured some of the provender in
advance of the rest, and bits are sticking to his mouth. A dog
licks them away, and in so doing bites the lip of the fellow,
who, in his pain, raps out a curse on the dog. The rest shout,
Get up and shut the gate! (Turkish, Behrnauer, Die vierzig
Veziere, p. 175 f.; Gibb, The History of the Forty Vezirs, p. 171
f.)</p>

<p>In the second Pickelheringsspiel, in the first part of
Engelische Comedien und Tragedien, 1620, a married pair contend
again about the shutting of a door. (R. K&ouml;hler; not seen by
me.)</p>

<p>In other cases, speaking first entails a penalty different
from shutting a door.</p>

<p>A young pair, lying in bed the first night after marriage,
engage that whichever of the two gets up first or speaks first
shall wash the dishes for a week. The husband, pretending to make
his will by the process of expressing by signs his acceptance or
rejection of the suggestions of a friend, bequeaths away from his
wife a handsome article of dress belonging to her. The wife
utters a protest, and has to wash the dishes. (Novelle di
Sercambi, ed. d'Ancona, p. 16, No 3, 'De simplicitate viri et
uxoris.')</p>

<p>A man complains of dry bread which his wife has given him for
his supper. She tells him to get up and moisten it; he bids her
do this, but she refuses. It is finally settled that the one that
speaks first shall moisten the bread. A visitor comes in and can
make neither of them say a word. He kisses the wife, gives the
husband a blow on the cheek; no word from either. He makes
complaint to the k&aacute;z&iacute;; the husband will say nothing
when brought before the k&aacute;z&iacute;, and is condemned to
be hanged. At the moment of execution the wife ejaculates, Alas,
my unfortunate husband! You devil, says he, go home and moisten
the bread! (An Arabian story in Beloe's Oriental Apologues, cited
by Clouston, II, 21.)</p>

<p>A shoemaker and his wife agree that the one who speaks first
shall carry back a frying-pan that they have borrowed. A soldier
who requires a girth for his horse asks the shoemaker to cut him
one, but gets no answer, though he threatens to take off the
man's head. Enraged at last, he seizes the shoemaker by the head
to do what he had menaced, when the wife cries out, For mercy's
sake, don't! Well done! says the husband, now carry back the pan.
(Bernoni, Fiabe pop. veneziane, p. 67, No 13, 'La Scomessa;'
Crane, Italian Popular Tales, p. 284.)</p>

<p>John makes terms with his wife that which of the two eats
first of a soup which she has brought in, or speaks the first
word, shall have a beating. William, of whom the husband is
jealous, comes to offer his company to go to a fight which is to
come off. Man and wife will neither eat nor speak, and he thinks
them possessed. He takes the woman by the hand, and she goes with
him. John cries out, Let my wife be! She says, John, you have
spoken and lost. (Ayrers Dramen, ed. von Keller, III,
2006-08.)</p>

<p>A man who has been taunting his wife as a cackler is
challenged by her to a trial at silence. A tinker comes in asking
for kettles to mend. He can make neither of them open their
mouth, and, as a last resource, offers to kiss the woman. The
husband cannot contain himself; the wife says, You have lost! and
remains mistress of the house, as she had been before. (Farce
d'un Chauldronnifer, Viollet Le Due, Ancien Th&eacute;atre
Fran&ccedil;ois, II, 109 ff.)<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d275_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
