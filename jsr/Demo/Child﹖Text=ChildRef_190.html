<h3>Jamie Telfer of the Fair Dodhead</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, I, 80, 1802; II, 3, 1833. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d19001.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>

<p>Scott, by whom this ballad was first published, and to whom
alone it seems to be known, gives us no information how he came
by it. He says, "There is another ballad, under the same title as
the following, in which nearly the same incidents are narrated,
with little difference except that the honor of rescuing the
cattle is attributed to the Liddesdale Elliots, headed by a
chief, there called Martin Elliot of the Preakin Tower, whose
son, Simon, is said to have fallen in the action. It is very
possible that both the Teviotdale Sootts and the Elliots were
engaged in the affair, and that each claimed the honor of the
victory." Ed. 1833, II. 8.</p>

<p>Scott has suggested that an article in the list of attempts
upon England, fouled by the commissioners at Berwick in the year
1587, may relate to the subject of the ballad.</p>

<p>Bewcastle, of which Thomas Musgrave at the above date was
deputy and captain, was, says Percy, a great rendezvous of
thieves and moss-troopers down to the last century. "It is handed
down by report," he remarks, "that there was formerly an Order of
Council that no inhabitant of Bewcastle should be returned on a
jury." That the deputy of the warden, an officer of the peace,
should be exhibited as making a raid, not in the way of
retaliation, but simply for plunder, is too much out of rule even
for Bewcastle, and does not speak favorably for the antiquity of
the ballad.</p>

<p>Taking the story as it stands, the Captain of Bewcastle, who
is looking for a prey, is taken by a guide to the Fair Dodhead,
which he pillages of kye and everything valuable. Jamie Telfer,
whose threat of revenge the Captain treats with derision, runs
ten miles afoot to the Elliots of Stobs Hall, to whom he says he
has paid mail, st. 11, and asks help. Gib Elliot denies the mail,
and tells him to go to the Scotts at Branksome where he has paid
it. Telfer keeps on to Coultart Cleugh, and there makes his case
known to a brother-in-law, who gives him a mount "to take the
fray" to Catslockhill. There William's Wat, who had often eaten
of the Dodhead basket, gives him his company and that of two
sons, and they take the fray to Branksome. Buccleuch collects a
body of men of his name, and sends them out under the command of
Willie Scott, who overtakes the marauders, and asks the Captain
if he will let Telfer's kye go back. This he will not do for love
or for fear. The Scotts set on them; Willie is killed, but two
and thirty of the raiders' saddles are emptied, and the Captain
is badly wounded and made prisoner. Nor is that all, for the
Scotts ride to the Captain's house and loose his cattle, and when
they come to the Fair Dodhead, for ten milk kye Jamie Telfer has
three and thirty.</p>

<p>Walter Scott of Harden and Walter Scott of Goldielands, and,
according to Scott of Satchells, Scott of Commonside, st. 26,
were engaged with Buccleuch in the rescue of Kinmont Willie. So
was Will Elliot of Gorrombye, st. 27<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<p>The ballad was retouched for the Border Minstrelsy, nobody can
say how much. The 36th stanza is in Hardyknute style. St. 12 is
not only found elsewhere (cf. '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_53.html">Young Beichan</a>,' E 6), but could
not be more inappropriately brought in than here; Scott, how
ever, is not responsible for that.</p>

<p>Scott makes the following notes on the localities:</p>

<p>2. Hardhaughswire is the pass from Liddesdale to the head of
Teviotdale. Borthwick water is a stream which falls into the
Teviot three miles above Hawick. 3, The Dodhead was in
Selkirkshire, near Singlee, where there are still the vestiges of
an old tower. 7. Stobs Hall: upon Slitterick. 10. Branksome Ha,
the ancient family-seat of the lairds of Buccleuch, near Hawick.
13. The Coultart Cleugh is nearly opposite to Carlinrig, on the
road between Hawick and Mosspaul. 26. The estates mentioned in
this verse belonged to families of the name of Scott residing
upon the waters of Borthwick and Teviot, near the castle of their
chief. 27. The pursuers seem to have taken the road through the
hills of Liddesdale in order to collect forces and intercept the
forayers at the passage of the Liddel on their return to
Bewcastle. 29. The Frostylee is a brook which joins the Teviot
near Mosspaul. 33, 38. The Ritterford and Kershopeford are noted
fords on the river Liddel. 36. The Dinlay is a mountain in
Liddesdale. 44. Stanegirthside: a house belonging to the For
esters, situated on the English side of the Liddel.</p>
