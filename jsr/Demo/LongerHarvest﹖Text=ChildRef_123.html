<p><b>B</b> also in the Roxburghe collection, III, 16.</p>

<p><b>B</b> <b>d</b> was printed in Ritson's Robin Hood, 1795,
II, 58, corrected by <b>b</b> and compared with <b>e</b>; and in
Evans's Old Ballads, 1777-1784, I, 136, probably from the
Aldermary garland.</p>

<p>The opening verses of <b>A</b> are of the same description as
those with which Nos 117, 118, 119, and others begin. 1 has been
corrupted, and 2 also, one would think, as there is no apparent
reason for maids weeping and young men wringing hands in the
merry month of May. In the first stanza,</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>But how many merry monthes be in the yeere?<br/>
There are 13 in May;<br/>
The midsummer moone is the merryest of all,<br/>
Next to the merry month of May.</td></tr>

<p><b>month</b>, in the first and the fourth line might be
changed to <b>moon</b>, to justify thirteen in the second, and to
accord with <b>moon</b> in the third. For in May, in the second
line, we may read, I say, or many say. The first stanza of No
140, B, runs:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>There are twelve months in all the year,<br/>
As I hear many say;<br/>
But the merriest month in all the year<br/>
Is the merry month of May.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Nearly, or quite, one half of <b>A</b> has been torn from the
manuscript, but there is no reason to suppose that the story
differed much from that of <b>B</b>.</p>

<p>Upon Little John's killing a hart at five hundred foot, Robin
Hood exclaims that he would ride a hundred mile to find John's
match. Scadlock, with a laugh, says that there is a friar at
Fountains Abbey who will beat both John and Robin, or indeed
Robin and all his yeomen. Robin Hood takes an oath never to eat
or drink till he has seen that friar. (Cf. No 30, I, 275, 279.)
Robin goes to Fountains Abbey, and ensconces his men in a
fern-brake. He finds the friar walking by the water, well armed,
and begs [orders, <b>B</b>] the friar to carry him over.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d123_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The
friar takes Robin on his back, and says no word till he is over;
then draws his sword and bids Robin carry him back, or he shall
rue it. Robin takes the friar on his back, and says no word till
he is over; then bids the friar carry him over once more. The
friar, without a word, takes Robin on his back, and when he comes
to the middle of the stream throws him in. When both have swum to
the shore, Robin lets an arrow fly, which the friar puts by with
his buckler. The friar cares not for his arrows, though Robin
shoots till his arrows are all gone. They take to swords, and
fight with them for six good hours, when Robin begs the boon of
blowing three blasts on his horn. The friar gives him leave to
blow his eyes out: fifty bowmen come raking over the lea. The
friar in turn asks a boon, to whistle thrice in his fist. Robin
cares not how much he whistles: fifty good bandogs come raking in
a row. Here there is a divergence. According to <b>A</b>, the
friar will match every man with a dog, and himself with Robin.
God forbid, says Robin; better be matched with three of the dogs
than with thee. Stay thy tikes, and let us be friends. In
<b>B</b>, two dogs go at Robin and tear his mantle from his back;
all the arrows shot at them the dogs catch in their mouths.
Little John calls to the friar to call off his dogs, and enforces
his words by laying half a score of them dead on the plain with
his bow. The friar cries, Hold; he will make terms. Robin Hood
offers the friar clothes and fee to forsake Fountains Abbey for
the green-wood. We must infer, as in the parallel case of the
Pinder of Wakefield, that the offer is accepted.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d123_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> But the
Curtal Friar, like the Pinder again, plays no part in Robin Hood
story out of his own ballad.</p>

<p>Robin Hood and the Friar, in both versions, is in a genuinely
popular strain, and was made to sing, not to print. Verbal
agreements show that <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> have an earlier ballad
as their common source; but of this, one or the other has
retained but little. I cannot think that <b>B</b> 33, 34 are of
the original matter. It is a derogation from Robin Hood's prowess
that he should have his mantle torn from his back, and we may ask
why the dogs do not catch Little John's arrows as well as
others.</p>

<p>Fountains Abbey, near Ripon, in the West Riding of Yorkshire,
was a Cistercian monastery, dating from the twelfth century. (It
is loosely called a nunnery in <b>A</b> 4.) The friar is called
"cutted" in <b>A</b> and "curtal" in <b>B</b>, and these words
have been held to mean short-frocked, and therefore to make the
friar a Franciscan. Staveley, The Romish Horseleech, speaking of
the Franciscans, says at p. 214, Experience shews that in some
countrys, where friers used to wear short habits, the order was
presently contemned and derided, and men called them curtaild
friers. Cited by Douce, Illustrations of Shakspere, I, 61. So,
according to Douce, we may probably understand the curtal friar
to be a curtailed friar, and in like manner of the curtal dogs.
"Cutted" in <b>A</b> can signify nothing but short-frocked. In
the title of that version, though not in the text, the friar is
called Tuck, which means that he is "ytukked hye," like Chaucer's
Friar John, but not that he wears a short frock. The friar in the
play (see below) has a "long cote," v. 46. But I apprehend that
<b>B</b> has the older word in curtal, and that curtal is simply
<i>curtilarius</i>, and applied to both friar and dogs because they had
the care and keeping of the <i>curtile</i>, or vegetable garden, of the
monastery.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d123_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The title of <b>A</b> in the Manuscript is Robin Hood and
Friar Tuck; from which it follows that the copyist, or some
predecessor, considered the stalwart friar of Fountains Abbey to
be one with the jocular friar of the May-games and the morris
dance. But Friar Tuck, the wanton and the merry, like Maid
Marian, owes his association with Robin Hood primarily to these
popular sports, and not in the least to popular ballads. In the
truly popular ballads Friar Tuck is never heard of, and in only
two even of the broadsides, Robin Hood and Queen Katherine and
Robin Hood's Golden Prize, is he so much as named; in both no
more than named, and in both in conjunction with Maid Marian.</p>

<p>'The Play of Robin Hood,' the first half of which is based on
the present ballad, calls the friar Friar Tuck, and represents
him accordingly. See the Appendix. He is also called Tuck in the
play founded on Guy of Gisborne.</p>

<p>In Munday's Downfall of Robert, Earl of Huntington, Friar Tuck
is by implication identified with the friar who fell into the
well, Dodsley's Old Plays, ed. Hazlitt, VIII, 185; and Mr.
Chappell is consequently led to say, at p. 390 of his 'Popular
Music,' that the ballad of the Friar in the Well was in all
probability a tale of "Robin Hood's fat friar." Cavilling at this
phrase of Shakspere's only so far as to observe that the friar of
the traditional Robin Hood ballad is as little fat as wanton, I
need but say that the truth of the case had been already
accurately expressed by Mr. Chappell at p. 274 of his invaluable
work: "the story is a very old one, and one of the many against
monks and friars in which not only England, but all Europe,
delighted."</p>

<p>The boon to blow three blasts on his horn, <b>B</b> 25, is
also asked by Robin of the Shepherd, No 135, st. 15. The reply
made by the Shepherd, st. 16, is, If thou shouldst blow till
tomorrow morn, I scorn one foot to flee. In R.H. Rescuing Three
Squires, <b>B</b> 25, when Robin, disguised as a beggar,
intimates to the sheriff that he may blow his horn, the answer is
nearly the same as here: Blow till both thy eyes fall out. In No
127, st. 34 f, Robin asks a boon of the Tinker, without
specifying what the boon is; the Tinker refuses; Robin blows his
horn while the Tinker is not looking. In No 135, st. 16 f, Robin
asks the three keepers to let him blow one blast on his horn, and
they refuse. This boon of [three] blasts on a horn is not an
important matter in these Robin Hood ballads, but it may be
noticed as a feature of other popular ballads in which an actor
is reduced to extremity: as in the Swedish ballad Stolts Signild,
Arwidsson, II, 128, No 97, and the corresponding Signild og
hendes Broder, Danske Viser, IV, 31, No 170, in both of which the
answer to the request is, Blow as much as you will. So in a
Russian bylina, when Solomon is to be hanged, he obtains
permission three several times to blow his horn, and is told to
blow as much as he will, and upon the third blast his army comes
to the rescue: Rybnikof, II, No 52, Jagi&#263;, in Archiv
f&uuml;r slavische Philologie, I, 104 ff; Miss Hapgood's Epic
Songs of Russia, p. 287 f; also F. Vogt, Salman und Morolf, p.
104, sts 494 ff.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d123_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Three cries take the place of three blasts,
upon occasion: as in the case of the unhappy maid in the German
forms of No 4, I, 32 ff, where also the maid is sometimes told to
cry as much as she wants, and in Gesta Romanorum, Oesterley, cap.
108, p. 440.</p>
