<h3>15. Leesome Brand</h3>

<p>This is one of the cases in which a remarkably fine ballad has
been worse preserved in Scotland than anywhere else. Without
light from abroad we cannot fully understand even so much as we
have saved. Though injured by the commixture of foreign elements,
A has still much of the original story. B has, on the contrary,
so little that distinctively and conclusively belongs to this
story that it might almost as well have been put with No. 16.</p>

<p>The ballad which 'Leesome Brand' represents is preserved among
the Scandinavian races under four forms. One form of the story in
Danish, 'Redselille og Medelvold' (Grundtvig, No. 271), runs
thus: A daughter is forced to acknowledge to her mother that she
has been beguiled by a knight. The mother threatens both with
punishment, and the daughter, alarmed, goes to her lover's house
at night, and informs him of the fate that awaits them. They ride
off on his horse and come to a wood. Then her pangs seize her,
but unwilling that a man should help her, she sends the knight in
search of water. When he comes to the spring, there sits a
nightingale and sings, "Redselille lies dead in the wood, with
two sons in her bosom." All that the nightingale has said is
found to be true. In some versions the knight digs a grave, and
lays mother and children in it; in two versions he lays himself
in the grave with them. It is not said whether the children are
dead or living, and the point would hardly be raised, but for
what follows. In certain Danish and Swedish versions, however, it
is expressly mentioned that the children are alive, and in some
Danish and Norwegian versions the children are heard, or seem to
be heard, shrieking from under the ground. Nearly all the
versions make the knight run himself through with his sword,
either immediately after the others are laid in the grave, or
after he has ridden far and wide, because he cannot endure the
cries of the children from under the earth. This would seem to be
the original conclusion of the story; the horrible circumstance
of the children being buried alive is much more likely to be
slurred over or omitted at a later day than to be added.</p>
