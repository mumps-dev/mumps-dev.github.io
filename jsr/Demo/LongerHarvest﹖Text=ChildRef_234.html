<li>'Charlie MacPherson,' Harris Manuscript, fol. 23 b. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d23401.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
<li>'Charlie M<sup>c</sup>Pherson,' Buchan's Ballads of the North 
of Scotland, I, 85. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d23402.html"><i>Version B</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Charlie MacPherson comes to Kinaldie with a large party of men
from the West Isle to take away Helen, whom he has long courted,
<b>A</b> 1, 4. Helen's mother is obliged to admit them. When her
daughter is asked for, MacPherson is told that she has gone to
Whitehouse, to marry auld Gairn, <b>A</b> 5 (Dalgairn, <b>B</b>
12). The party go on to Whitehouse, where indeed they find Helen,
and everybody there calling her bride. We expect a collision, and
judging by <b>A</b> 8 there was one, with the bride wishing well
to the assailants. But in <b>B</b> (where there is no hint that
Helen favors her irregular suitor), MacPherson comports himself
very mildly, and only wishes, as he goes off, that his heavy
heart may light on Whitehouse of Cromar.</p>

<p>The ballad was known to Mrs. Brown of Falkland.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d234_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> She gives
it the title of 'The Carrying-off of the Heiress of Kiuady,' from
which it is warrantable to conclude that MacPherson was so far
successful.</p>

<p>There are several Kinaldies and more than one Whitehouse. The
Kinaldie which we have to do with here is a small place in the
parish of Logie-Coldstoue, Cromar. Milton of Whitehouse is about
a mile to the south of Kinaldie, and seems to be the place
intended by Whitehouse o Cromar, <b>B</b> 18, 20. Braemar,
<b>A</b> 7<sup>1</sup>, should then be Cromar.</p>
