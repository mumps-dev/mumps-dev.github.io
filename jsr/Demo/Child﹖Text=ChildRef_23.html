<h3>Judas</h3>

<a name="Page_I_242"/>
<ol type="A">
<li>Manuscript B. 14, 39, of the thirteenth century, library of
Trinity College, Cambridge, as printed in Wright &amp;
Halliwell's Reliquiae Antiquae, I, 144. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d02301.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>This legend, which has not been heretofore recognized as a
ballad, is, so far as is known, unique in several particulars.
The common tradition gives Judas an extraordinary domes tic
history,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d023_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> but does not endow him with a sister as perfidious as
himself. Neither is his selling his Master for thirty pieces
accounted for elsewhere as it is here, if it may be strictly said
to be accounted for here.</p>

<p>A popular explanation, founded upon John xii, 3-6, and current
for six centuries and more, is that Judas, bearing the bag, was
accustomed to take tithes of all moneys that came into his hands,
and that he considered he had lost thirty pence on the precious
ointment which had not been sold for three hundred pence, and
took this way of indemnify ing himself.</p>

<p>A Wendish ballad, Haupt und Schmaler, I, 276, No 284, has the
following story. Jesus besought hospitality for himself and his
disciples of a poor widow. She could give a lodging,
<a name="Page_I_243"/>
but had no
bread. Jesus said he would care for that, and asked which of his
disciples would go and buy bread for thirty pieces of silver.
Judas offered himself eagerly, and went to the Jews' street to do
his errand. Jews were gaining, under a tub, and they challenged
Judas to play. The first time he won the stake, and the second.
The third time he lost everything. "Why so sad, Judas?" they say:
"go sell your Master for thirty pieces." We are to suppose Judas
to have rejoined his company. Jesus then asks who has sold him.
John says, Is it I? and Peter, and then Judas, to whom Jesus
replies, Thou knowest best. Judas, in remorse, runs to hang
himself. The Lord bids him turn, for his sin is forgiven. But
Judas keeps on till he comes to a fir: "Soft wood, thou fir, thou
wilt not bear me." Further on, till he comes to an aspen. "Hard
wood, thou aspen, thou wilt bear me." So he hanged himself on the
aspen; and still the aspen shakes and trembles for fear of the
judgment day.</p>

<p>According to the ballads, then, Judas lost the thirty pieces
at play, or was robbed of them, with collusion of his sister. But
his passionate behavior in the English ballad, st. 9, goes beyond
all apparent occasion. Surely it was not for his tithe of the
thirty pieces.</p>

<p>And why does he insist to Pilate on the very thirty pieces he
had lost, rejecting every other form of payment? The
ballad-singer might answer, So it was, and rest contented. Or
perhaps he might have heard, and might tell us by way of comment,
that these pieces had for long ages been destined to be " the
price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel
did value; " had been coined by Abraham's father for Ninus, and
been given by Terah to his son; had passed through various hands
to the Ishmaelites, had been paid by them as the price of Joseph,
and been repaid to Joseph by his brethren for corn in Egypt;
thence were transferred to Sheba, and in the course of events
were brought by the Queen of the South as an offering to
Solomon's temple; when the temple was despoiled by
Nebuchadnezzar, were given by him to the king of Godolia, and
after the kingdom of Godolia had been fused in that of Nubia,
were brought as his tribute to the infant Jesus by Melchior, king
of the same, etc.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d023_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that the manuscript from which this
piece was taken has been for some years lost from Trinity College
Library, so that a collation of Wright's text has not been
possible.</p>
