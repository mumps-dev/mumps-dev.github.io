<p>Pinkerton gave the first information concerning <b>A</b>, in Ancient
Scotish Poems ... from the manuscript collections of Sir Richard
Maitland, etc., II, 496, and he there printed the first and last
stanzas of the broadside. Motherwell printed the whole in the
appendix to his Minstrelsy, No I. What stands as the last stanza
in the broadside is now prefixed to the ballad, as having been
the original burden. It is the only example, so far as I
remember, which our ballads afford of a burden of this kind, one
that is of greater extent than the stanza with which it was sung,
though this kind of burden seems to have been common enough with
old songs and carols.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d002_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The "old copy in black letter" used for <b>B</b> was close to <b>A</b>, if
not identical, and has the burden-stem at the end like <b>A</b>. 'The
Jockey's Lamentation,' Pills to Purge Melancholy, V, 317, has the
burden,<br/>

The 'Bridal Sark,' Cromek's Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway

manufacture and impostures; at least, they seem to have imposed
upon Cromek.</p>

<p>A like ballad is very common in German. A man would take, or
keep, a woman for his love or his wife [servant, in one case], if
she would spin brown silk from oaten straw. She will do this if
he will make clothes for her of the linden-leaf. Then she must
bring him shears from the middle of the Rhine. But first he must
build her a bridge from a single twig, etc., etc. To this effect,

<p>The Graidhne whom we have seen winning Fionn for husband by
guessing his riddles, <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_1.html#Fionn">p. 3</a>, afterwards became enamored of
Diarmaid, Fionn's nephew, in consequence of her accidentally
seeing a beauty spot on Diarmaid's forehead. This had the power
of infecting with love any woman whose eye should light upon it:
wherefore Diarmaid used to wear his cap well down. Graidhne tried
to make Diarmaid run away with her. But he said, "I will not go
with thee. I will not take thee in softness, and I will not take
thee in hardness; I will not take thee without, and I will not
take thee within; I will not take thee on horseback, and I will
not take thee on foot." Then he went and built himself a house
where he thought he should be out of her way. But Graidhne found
him out. She took up a position between the two sides of the
door, on a buck goat, and called to him to go with her. For, said
she, "I am not without, I am not within; I am not on foot, and I
am not on a horse; and thou must go with me." After this Diarmaid
had no choice. 'Diarmaid and Grainne,' Tales of the West
Highlands, in, 39-49; 'How Fingal got Graine to be his wife, and
she went away with Diarmaid,' Heroic Gaelic Ballads, p. 153; 'The
Death of Diarmaid,' ib., p. 154. The last two were written down
c. 1774.</p>

<p>In all stories of the kind, the person upon whom a task is
imposed stands acquitted, if another of no less difficulty is
devised which must be performed first. This preliminary may be
something that is essential for the execution of the other, as in
the German ballads, or equally well something that has no kind
of relation to the original requisition, as in the English
ballads.</p>

<p>An early form of such a story is preserved in Gesta Romanorum,
c. 64, Oesterley, p. 374. It were much to be wished that search
were made for a better copy, for, as it stands, this tale is to
be interpreted only by the English ballad. The old English
version, Madden, XLIII, p. 142, is even worse mutilated than the
Latin. A king, who was stronger, wiser, and handsomer than any
man, delayed, like the Marquis of Saluzzo, to take a wife. His
friends urged him to marry, and he replied to their
expostulations, "You know I am rich enough and powerful enough;
find me a maid who is good looking and sensible, and 1 will take
her to wife, though she be poor." A maid was found who was
eminently good looking and sensible, and of royal blood besides.
The king wished to make trial of her sagacity, and sent her a bit
of linen three inches square, with a promise to marry her if she
would make him a shirt of this, of proper length and width. The
lady stipulated that the king should send her "a vessel in which
she could work," and she would make the shirt: "michi vas
concedat in quo operari potero, et camisiam satis longam ei
promitto." So the king sent "vas debitum et preciosum," the
shirt was made, and the king married her.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d002_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It may be doubted
whether the sagacious maid did not, in the unmutilated story,
deal with the problem as is done in a Transylvanian tale, Haltrich,
Deutsche Volksm&auml;rchen, u.s.w., No 45, p. 245, where the
king requires the maid to make a shirt and drawers of two
threads. The maid, in this instance, sends the king a couple of
broomsticks, requiring that he should first make her a loom and
bobbin-wheel out of them.</p>

<p>The tale just cited, 'Der Burgh&uuml;ter und seine kluge Tochter,'
is one of several which have been obtained from tradition in this
century, that link the ballads of The Clever Lass with oriental
stories of great age. The
<a name="Page_I_9"/>
material points are these. A king
requires the people of a parish to answer three questions, or he
will be the destruction of them all: What is the finest sound,
the finest song, the finest stone? A poor warder is instructed by
his daughter to reply, the ring of bells, the song of the angels,
the philosopher's stone. "Right," says the king, "but that
never came out of your head. Confess who told you, or a dungeon
is your doom." The man owns that he has a clever daughter, who
had told him what to say. The king, to prove her sagacity
further, requires her to make a shirt and drawers of two threads,
and she responds in the manner just indicated. He next sends her
by her father an earthen pot with the bottom out, and tells her
to sew in a bottom so that no seam or stitch can be seen. She
sends her father back with a request that the king should first
turn the pot inside out, for cobblers always sew on the inside,
not on the out. The king next demanded that the girl should come
to him, neither driving, nor walking, nor riding; neither dressed
nor naked; neither out of the road nor in the road; and bring him
something that was a gift and no gift. She put two wasps between
two plates, stripped, enveloped herself in a fishing-net, put her
goat into the rut in the road, and, with one foot on the goat's
back, the other stepping along the rut, made her way to the king.
There she lifted up one of the plates, and the wasps flew away:
so she had brought the king a present and yet no present. The
king thought he could never find a shrewder woman, and married
her.</p>

<p>Of the same tenor are a tale in Zingerle's Tyrolese Kinder u.
Hausm&auml;rchen, 'Was ist das Sch&ouml;nste, St&auml;rkste und
Reichste?' No. 27, p. 162, and another in the Colshorns'
Hanoverian M&auml;rchen u. Sagen, 'Die kluge Dirne,' No 26, p.
79. Here a rich and a poor peasant [a farmer and his bailiff]
have a case in court, and wrangle till the magistrate, in his
weariness, says he will give them three questions, and whichever
answers right shall win. The questions in the former tale are:
What is the most beautiful, what the strongest, what the richest
thing in the world? In the other, What is fatter than fat? How
heavy is the moon? How far is it to heaven? The answers suggested
by the poor peasant's daughter are: Spring is the most beautiful
of things, the ground the strongest, autumn the richest. And the
bailiff's daughter answers': The ground is fatter than fat, for
out of it comes all that's fat, and this all goes back again;
the moon has four quarters, and four quarters make a pound;
heaven is only one day's journey, for we read in the Bible,
"Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise." The judge sees that these
replies are beyond the wit of the respondents, and they own to
having been prompted by a daughter at home. The judge then says
that if the girl will come to him neither dressed nor naked,
etc., he will marry her; and so the shrewd wench becomes a
magistrate's wife.</p>

<p>'Die kluge Bauerntochter,' in the Grimms' K. u. H.
m&auml;rchen, No 94, and 'Die kluge Hirtentochter,' in
Pr&ouml;hle's M&auml;rchen f&uuml;r die Jugend, No 49, p. 181, afford
another variety of these tales. A peasant, against the advice of
his daughter, carries the king a golden mortar, as he had found
it, without any pestle. The king shuts him up in prison till he
shall produce the pestle [Grimms]. The man does nothing but cry,
"Oh, that I had listened to my daughter!" The king sends for him,
and, learning what the girl's counsel had been, says he will give
her a riddle, and if she can make it out will marry her. She must
come to him neither clothed nor naked, neither riding nor

<p>Another story of the kind, and very well preserved, is No 25
of Vuk's Volksm&auml;rchen der Serben, 'Von dem M&auml;dchen das an
Weisheit den Kaiser &uuml;bertraf,' p. 157. A poor
<a name="Page_I_10"/>
man had a wise daughter. An emperor gave him thirty
eggs, and said his daughter must hatch chickens from these, or it
would go hard with her. The girl perceived that the eggs had been
boiled. She boiled some beans, and told her father to be
ploughing along the road, and when the emperor came in sight, to
sow them and cry, "God grant my boiled beans may come up!" The
emperor, hearing these ejaculations, stopped, and said, "My poor
fellow, how can boiled beans grow?" The father answered,
according to instructions, "As well as chickens can hatch from
boiled eggs." Then the emperor gave the old man a bundle of
linen, and bade him make of it, on pain of death, sails and
everything else requisite for a ship. The girl gave her father a
piece of wood, and sent him back to the emperor with the message
that she would perform what he had ordered, if he would first
make her a distaff, spindle, and loom out of the wood. The
emperor was astonished at the girl's readiness, and gave the old
man a, glass, with which she was to drain the sea. The girl
dispatched her father to the emperor again with a pound of tow,
and asked him to stop the mouths of all the rivers that flow into
the sea; then she would drain it dry. Here upon the emperor
ordered the girl herself be fore him, and put her the question,
"What is heard furthest?" "Please your Majesty," she answered,
"thunder and lies." The emperor then, clutching his beard, turned
to his assembled counsellors, and said, "Guess how much my beard
is worth." One said so much, another so much. But the girl said,
"Nay, the emperor's beard is worth three rains in summer." The
emperor took her to wife.</p>

<p>With these traditional tales we may put the story of wise
Petronelle and Alphonso, king of Spain, told after a chronicle,
with his usual prolixity, by Gower, Confessio Amantis, Pauli, I,
145 ff . The king valued himself highly for his wit, and was
envious of a knight who hitherto had answered all his questions.
Determined to confound his humbler rival, he devised three which
he thought unanswerable, sent for the knight, and gave him a
fortnight to consider his replies, which failing, he would lose
his goods and head. The knight can make nothing of these
questions, which are, What is that which needs help least and
gets most? What is worth most and costs least? What costs most
and is worth least? The girl, who is but fourteen years old,
observing her father's heavy cheer, asks him the reason, and
obtains his permission to go to court with him and answer the
questions. He was to say to the king that he had deputed her to
answer, to make trial of her wits. The answer to the first
question is the earth, and agrees in the details with the
solution of the query, What is fatter than fat? in the Tyrolese
and the Hanoverian tale. Humility is the answer to the second,
and pride the third answer. The king admires the young maid, and
says he would marry her if her father were noble; but she may ask
a boon. She begs for her father an earldom which had lately
escheated; and, this granted, she reminds the king of what he had
said; her father is now noble. The king marries her.</p>

<p>In all these seven tales a daughter gets her father out of
trouble by the exercise of a superior understanding, and marries
an emperor, a king, or at least far above her station. The
Grimms' story has the feature, not found in the others, that the
father had been thrown into prison. Still another variety of
these stories, inferior, but preserving essential traits, is
given by Schleicher, Litauische M&auml;rchen, p. 3, 'Vom schlauen
M&auml;dchen.'</p>

<p>A Turkish tale from South Siberia will take us a step further,
'Die beiden F&uuml;rsten,' Radloff, Proben der Volkslitteratur der
t&uuml;rkischen St&auml;mme S&uuml;d-Sibiriens, I, 197. A prince had a
feeble-minded son, for whom he wished to get a wife. He found a
girl gathering fire-wood with others, and, on asking her
questions, had reason to be pleased with her superior discretion.
He sent an ox to the girl's father, with a message that on the
third day he would pay him a visit, and if by that time he had
not made the ox drop a calf and give milk, he would lose his
head. The old man and his wife fell to weeping. The daughter bade
them be of good cheer, killed the ox, and gave it to her parents
to eat. On the
<a name="Page_I_11"/>
third day she stationed herself on the road by
which the prince would come, and was gathering herbs. The prince
asked what this was for. The girl said, "Because my father is in
the pangs of child-birth, and I am going to spread these herbs
under him." "Why," said the prince, "it is not the way, that men
should bear children." "But if a man can't bear children,"
answered the girl, "how can an ox have, a calf?" The prince was
pleased, but said nothing. He went away, and sent his messenger
again with three stones in a bag. He would come on the third day,
and if the stones were not then made into boots, the old man
would lose his head. On the third day the prince came, with all
his grandees. The girl was by the roadside, collecting sand in a
bag. "What are you going to do with that sand?" asked the prince.
"Make thread," said she. "But who ever made thread out of sand?"
"And who ever made boots out of stones?" she rejoined. The prince
laughed in his sleeve, prepared a great wedding, and married the
girl to his son. Soon after, an other prince wrote him a letter,
saying, "Do not let us be fighting and killing, but let us guess
riddles. If you guess all mine, I will be your subject; if you
fail, I will take all your having." They were a whole year at the
riddles. The other prince "knew three words more," and threw ours
into a deep dungeon. From the depths of this dungeon he contrived
to send a profoundly enigmatic dispatch to his daughter-in-law,
who understood everything, disguised herself as one of his
friends, and proposed to the victor to guess riddles again. The
clever daughter-in-law "knew seven words more" than he, took her
father-in-law out of the dungeon, threw his rival in, and had all
the people and property of the vanquished prince for her own.</p>

<p>This Siberian tale links securely those which precede it with
a remarkable group of stories, covering by representatives still
extant, or which may be shown to have existed, a large part of
Asia and of Europe. This group includes, besides a Wallachian
and a Magyar tale from recent popular tradition, one Sanskrit
form; two Tibetan, derived from Sanskrit; one Mongol, from
Tibetan; three Arabic and one Persian, which also had their
source in Sanskrit; two Middle-Greek, derived from Arabic, one of
which is lost; and two old Russian, from lost Middle-Greek
versions.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d002_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The gist of these narratives is that one king 
propounds tasks to another; in the earlier ones, 
with the intent to discover whether his brother 
monarch enjoys the aid of such counsellors as 
will make an attack on him dangerous; in the 
later, with a demand that he shall acquit 
himself satisfactorily, or suffer a forfeit: and 
the king is delivered from a serious strait by 
the sagacity either of a minister (whom he had 
ordered to be put to death, but who was still 
living in prison, or at least seclusion) or of 
the daughter of his minister, who came to her 
father's assistance. Which is the prior of 
these two last inventions it would not be easy 
to say. These tasks are always such as require ingenuity of one kind or another, whether 
in devising practical experiments, in contriving subterfuges, in solving riddles, or even in 
constructing compliments.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d002_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>One of the Tibetan tales, which, though
<a name="Page_I_12"/>
dating from the
beginning of our era, will very easily be recognized in the
Siberian tradition of this century, is to this effect. King
Rabssaldschal had a rich minister, who desired a suitable wife
for his youngest son. A Brahman, his trusty friend, undertook to
find one. In the course of his search, which extended through
many countries, the Brahman saw one day a company of five
hundred maidens, who were making garlands to offer to Buddha. One
of these attracted his notice by her behavior, and impressed him
favorably by replies to questions which he put.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d002_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The Brahman
made proposals to her father in behalf of the minister's son.
These were accepted, and the minister went with a great train to
fetch home the bride. On the way back his life was twice saved by
taking her advice, and when she was domiciliated, she so
surpassed her sisters-in-law in housekeeping talents and virtues
that everything was put under her direction. Discord arose
between the king of the country she had left and Rabssaldschal,
under whom she was now living. The former wished to make trial
whether the latter had an able and keen-witted minister or not,
and sent him two mares, dam and filly, exactly alike in
appearance, with the demand that he should distinguish them.
Neither king nor counsellor could discern any difference; but
when the minister's daughter heard of their difficulty, she said,
"Nothing is easier. Tie the two together and put grass before
them; the mother will push the best before the foal." This was
done; the king decided accordingly, and the hostile ambassador
owned that he was right. Soon after, the foreign prince sent two
snakes, of the same size and form, and demanded which was male,
which female. The king and his advisers were again in a quandary.
The minister resorted to his daughter-in-law. She said, "Lay them
both on cotton-wool: the female will lie quiet, the male not; for
it is of the feminine nature to love the soft and the
comfortable, which the masculine cannot tolerate." They followed
these directions; the king gave his verdict, the ambassador
acquiesced, the minister received splendid presents. For a final
trial the unfriendly king sent a long stick of wood, of equal
thickness, with no knots or marks, and asked which was the under
and which the upper end. No one could say. The minister referred
the question to his daughter. She answered, "Put the stick into
water: the root end will sink a little, the upper end float." The
experiment was tried; the king said to the ambassador, "This is
the upper end, this the root end," to which he assented, and
great presents were again given to the minister. The adverse
monarch was convinced that his only safe course was peace and
conciliation, and sent his ambassador back once more with an
offering of precious jewels and of amity for the future. This
termination was highly gratifying to Rabssaldschal, who said to
his minister, How could you see through all these things? The
minister said, It was not I, but my clever daughter-in-law. When
the king learned this, he raised the young woman to the rank of
his younger sister.</p>

<p>The wise daughter is not found in the Sanskrit tale,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d002_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
which also differs from the Buddhist versions in this: that in
the Sanskrit the minister had become an object of displeasure to
the king, and in consequence had long been lying in prison when
the crisis occurred which rendered him indispensable, a
circumstance which is repeated in the tale of The Wise Heykar
(Arabian Nights, Breslau transl., XIII 73 ff , Cabinet des
F&eacute;es, XXXIX, 266 ff) and in the Life of &AElig;sop. But
The Clever Wench reappears in another tale in the same Sanskrit
collection (with that express title), and gives her aid to her
father, a priest, who has been threatened with banishment by his
king if he does not clear up a dark matter within five days. She
may also be recognized in Moradbak, in Von der Hagen's 1001 Tag,
VIII, 199 ff, and even in the minister's wife in the story of The
Wise Heykar.</p>

<a name="Page_I_13"/>
<p>The tasks of discriminating dam and filly and the root end
from the tip end of a stick, which occur both in the Tibetan
tales and the Shukasaptcati, are found again, with unimportant
changes, in the Wallachian popular story, and the Hungarian,
which in general resemble the Arabic. Some of those in the
Arabian tale and in the Life of &AElig;sop are of the same nature
as the wit-trials in the Servian and German popular tales, the
story in the Gesta Romanorum, and the German and English ballads.
The wise Heykar, e.g., is required to sew together a burst
mill-stone. He hands the king a pebble, requesting him first to
make an awl, a file, and scissors out of that. The king of Egypt
tells &AElig;sop, the king of Babylon's champion sage, that when
his mares hear the stallions neigh in Babylon, they cast their
foal. &AElig;sop's slaves are told to catch a cat, and are set to
scourging it before the Egyptian public. Great offense is given,
on account of the sacred character of the animal, and complaint
is made to the king, who sends for &AElig;sop in a rage.
&AElig;sop says his king has suffered an injury from this cat,
for the night before the cat had killed a fine fighting-cock of
his. "Fie, &AElig;sop!" says the king of Egypt; "how could the
cat go from Egypt to Babylon in one night?" "Why not," replies
&AElig;sop, "as well as mares in Egypt hear the stallions neigh
in Babylon and cast their foal?"</p>

<p>The tales in the Shukasaptati and in the Dsanglun represent
the object of the sending of the tasks to be to ascertain whether
the king retains the capable minister through whom he has
acquired supremacy. According to the Arabian tale, and those
derived from it, tribute is to be paid by the king whose riddles
are guessed, or by him who fails to guess. This form of story,
though it is a secondary one, is yet by no means late, as is
shown by the anecdote in Plutarch, Septem Sapientum Convivium
(6), itself probably a fragment of such a story, in which the
king of the &AElig;thiops gives a task to Amasis, king of Egypt,
with a stake of many towns and cities. This task is the favorite
one of draining [drinking] all the water in the sea, which we
have had in the Servian tale (it also is in the Life of
&AElig;sop), and Bias gives the customary advice for dealing with
it.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d002_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>From the number of these wise virgins should not be excluded
the king's daughter in the Gesta Romanorum who guesses rightly
among the riddles of the three caskets and marries the emperor's
son, though Bassanio has extinguished her just fame: Madden's Old
English Versions, p. 238, No 66; Collier, Shakspere's Library, II,

<p>The first three or four stanzas of <b>A</b>-<b>E</b> form the beginning of
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_4.html">Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight</a>,' and are especially appropriate
to that ballad, but not to this. The two last stanzas of <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
make no kind of sense here, and these at least, probably the
opening verses as well, must belong to some other and lost
ballad. An elf setting tasks, or even giving riddles, is unknown,
I believe, in Northern tradition, and in no form of this story,
except the English, is a preternatural personage of any kind the
hero. Still it is better to urge nothing more than that the elf
is an intruder in this particular ballad, for riddle-craft is
practised by a variety of preternatural beings: notoriously by
Odin, Thor, the giant Vaf&thorn;ru&eth;nir, and the dwarf Alw&iacute;ss in the
Edda, and again by a German "berggeist" (Ey, Harzm&auml;rchenbuch, p.
64, 'Die verw&uuml;nschte Prinzessin'), a Greek
<a name="Page_I_14"/>
dragon (Hahn,
Griechische u. Albanesische M&auml;rchen, II, 210), the Russian
rusalka, the Servian vila,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d002_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> the Indian rakshas.

For example:
a rusalka (water-nymph) pursues a pretty girl, and says, I will
give you three riddles: if you guess them, I will let you go home
to your father; if you do not, I shall take you with me. What
grows without a root? What runs without any object? What blooms
without any flower? She answers, Stones grow without a root;
water runs without any object; the fern blooms without any
flower. These answers seem satisfactory, as riddles go, but the
ballad concludes (with an injustice due to corruption?), "The
girl did not guess the riddles: the rusalka tickled her to
death." (Wojcicki, Pie&#347;ni, I, 205.)

 A rakshas (ogre) says he will
spare a man's life if he can answer four questions, and shall
devour him if he cannot. What is cruel? What is most to the
advantage of a householder? What is love? What best accomplishes
difficult things? These questions the man answers, and confirms
his answers by tales, and gains the rakshas' "good will. (Jacob,
Hindoo Tales, or the Adventures of Ten Princes, a translation of
the Sanskrit Dasakumaracharitam, p. 260 ff.)</p>

<p>The auld man in <b>J</b> is simply the "unco knicht" of 1 <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, over
again. He has clearly displaced the elf-knight, for the elf's
attributes of hill-haunting and magical music remain, only they
have been transferred to the lady. That the devil should supplant
the knight, unco or familiar, is natural enough. He may come in
as the substitute of the elfin knight because the devil is the
regular successor to any heathen sprite, or as the embodiment of
craft and duplicity, and to give us the pleasure of seeing him
outwitted. We find the devil giving riddles, as they are called
(tasks), in the Grimms' K. u. H. m&auml;rchen, No 125 (see also
the note in vol. III); Pr&ouml;hle's K. u. V. m&auml;rchen, No 19;
Vernaleken, Oesterreichische K. u. H. m&auml;rchen, No 37. He
also appears as a riddle-monger in one of the best stories in the
Golden Legend. A bishop, who was especially devoted to St. Andrew,
was tempted by Satan under the semblance of a beautiful woman,
and was all but lost, when a loud knocking was heard at the door.

A pilgrim demanded admittance. The lady, being asked her pleasure
about this, recommended that three questions should be put to the
stranger, to show whether he were fit to appear in such presence.
Two questions having been answered unexceptionably, the fiend
proposed a third, which was meant to be a clincher: How far is it
from earth to heaven? "Go back to him that sent you," said the
pilgrim (none other than St. Andrew) to the messenger, "and say
that he himself knows best, for he measured the distance when he
fell." <i>Antiquus hostis de medio evanuit</i>. Much the same is related
in the legend of St. Bartholomew, and, in a Slovenian ballad, of
St. Ulrich, who interposes to save the Pope from espousing Satan
in disguise.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d002_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
