<p>There is a copy of the broadside among the Pepys ballads, II,
148, No 130, printed, like <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, for P.
Brooksby, with the variation, "at the Golden Ball, near the Bear
Tavern, in Pye Corner." The ballad was given in Ritson's Ancient
Songs, 1790, p. 192, from <b>A</b> <b>a</b>, collated with
another copy "in the hands of John Baynes, Esq." In a note, p.
332, Ritson says: "In the editor's collection is a somewhat
different ballad upon the same subject, intitled '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_155.html">Sir Hugh</a> in the
Grimes downfall, or a new song made on Sir Hugh in the Grime, who
was hangd for stealing the Bishop's mare.' It begins, 'Good Lord
John is a hunting gone.'" This last was evidently the late and
corrupt copy <b>D</b>. Of <b>C</b> Scott says: "The present
edition was procured for me by my friend Mr. W. Laidlaw, in
Blackhouse, and has been long current in Selkirkshire. Mr.
Ritson's copy has occasionally been resorted to for better
readings." <b>B</b> is partially rewritten by Cunningham, Songs
of Scotland, I, 327. The copy in R.H. Evans's Old Ballads, 1810,
I, 367, is <b>A</b>; that in The Ballads and Songs of Ayrshire,
First Series, p. 47, is of course <b>B</b>; Aytoun, ed. of 1859,
II, 128, reprints <b>C</b>; Maidment, 1868, II, 140, <b>A</b>,

<p>"According to tradition," says Stenhouse, 
"Robert Aldridge, Bishop of Carlisle, about 
the year 1560, seduced the wife of Hugh 
Graham, one of those bold and predatory 
chiefs who so long inhabited what was called 
the debateable land on the English and Scottish border. Graham, being unable to bring 
so powerful a prelate to justice, in revenge 
made an excursion into Cumberland, and carried off, inter alia, a fine mare belonging to 
the bishop; but being closely pursued by Sir 
John Scroope, warden of Carlisle, with a 
party on horseback, was apprehended near 
Solway Moss, and carried to Carlisle, where 
he was tried and convicted of felony. Great 
intercessions were made to save his life, but 
the bishop, it is said, being determined to remove the chief obstacle to his guilty passions, 
remained inexorable, and poor Graham fell a 
victim to his own indiscretion and his wife's 
infidelity. Anthony Wood observes that 
there were many changes in this prelate's 
time, both in church and state, but that he 
retained his office and preferments during 
them all." Musical Museum, 1853, IV, 297.</p>

<p>The pretended tradition is plainly extracted from the ballad,
the bishop's name and the date being supplied from without. The
inter alia is introduced, and the mare qualified as a fine one,
to mitigate the ridiculousness of making Hugh Graham steal a mare
to retaliate the wrong done him by the bishop. As Allan
Cunningham remarks, "tradition, in all the varieties of her
legends, never invented suh an unnecessary and superfluous reason
as this. By habit and by nature thieves, the Grsemes never waited
for anything like a pretence to steal." In passing, it may be
observed that Hugh is quite arbitrarily elevated to the rank of a
predatory chief.</p>

<p>Scott suggested in 1803, Minstrelsy, I, 86 f., that Hugh
Graham may have been one of more than four hundred borderers
against whom complaints were exhibited to the lord bishop of
Carlisle for incursions, murders, burnings, mutilations, and
spoils committed by the English of Cumberland and Westmoreland
upon Scots "presently after the queen's departure;" that is,
after Mary Stuart's going to France, which was in 1548. Nearly a
third of the names given in a partial list are Grames, but there
is no Hugh among them.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d191_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The bishop of Carlisle at the time
was Robert Aldridge, who held the see from 1537 till his death in
1555.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d191_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Lord Scroope (Screw) is the English warden of the West
Marches in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. A Lord Scroope had that
office in 1542, but Lord Wharton, Lord Dacre, and others during
the last years of Bishop Aldridge's life, say from 1548 to 1555.
Henry Lord Scroope of Bolton was appointed to the place in 1563,
retained it thirty years, and was succeeded by his son,
Thomas.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d191_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Considering how long the Scroopes held the
wardenship, and that the ballad is not so old as the middle of
the sixteenth century, the fact that a Lord Scroope was not
warden in the precise year when the complaints were addressed to
the bishop of Carlisle would be of no consequence if Scott's
conjecture were well supported.</p>

<p>The story is the same in <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>, and in <b>B</b>
also till we near the end, though there are variations in the
names. The scene is at Carlisle in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>;
at Stirling in <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>. Lord Home, who appears as
intercessor for Hugh Graham in <b>C</b>, exercises the authority
of the Scottish warden and arrests Hugh in <b>E</b>. Lord Home
was warden of the east marches of Scotland from 1550, and I know
not how much earlier, to 1564. The Lord Boles of <b>A</b> may
possibly represent Sir Robert Bowes, who was warden of the east
marches of England in 1550 and earlier. The Whitefoords of
<b>B</b> are adopted into the ballad from the region in which
that version circulated, they being " an ancient family in
Renfrewshire and Lanarkshire, and latterly in Ayrshire."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d191_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The high jump which Hugh makes in <b>A</b> 18, <b>C</b> 12,
<b>D</b> 4 (fourteen, or even eighteen, feet, with his hands tied
on his back), is presumably an effort at escape, though, for all
that is said, it might be a leap in the air. In <b>E</b> 16-19,
the prisoner jumps an eighteen-foot wall (tied as before), is
defended by four brothers against ten pursuers, and sent over
sea: which is certainly a modern perversion. <b>A</b> is
strangely corrupted in several places, 2<sup>2</sup>,
11<sup>4</sup>, 13<sup>2</sup>. Screw is plainly for Scroope.
Garlard, sometimes printed Garland, is an obscuration of
Carlisle. The extravagance in 16<sup>3</sup>, it is to be hoped,
is a corruption also. Stanzas 3, 8 of <b>B</b> are obviously, as
Cromek says, the work of Burns, and the same is true of
10<sup>3,4</sup>. But Burns has left some nonsense in 11, 12: 'my
sword that's bent in the middle clear,' 'my sword that's bent in
the middle brown.' We have more of this meaningless phraseology
in <b>E</b> 10, 11, 12, where swords are pointed 'wi the metal
clear,' 'brown,' 'fine.' Stanza 15 of <b>E</b> is borrowed from
