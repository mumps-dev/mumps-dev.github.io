<h3>Northumberland Betrayed by Douglas</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Northumberland betrayd by Dowglas,' Percy Manuscript, p. 259;
Hales and Furnivall, II, 217. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d17601.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Printed in Percy's Reliques, 1765, I, 257, "from two copies
[which contained great variations, 1794, I, 297], one of them in
the Editor's folio Manuscript" In this manuscript Percy makes
these notes. "N.B. My other copy is more correct than this, and
contains much which is omitted here. N.B. The other copy begins
with lines the same as that in page 112 [that is, the 'Earl of
Westmoreland']. The minstrels often made such changes."</p>

<p>See the preface to the foregoing ballad as to the probable
character of the copy, which "contains much that is omitted
here."</p>

<p>The Earl of Sussex writes on December 22d that, the next
morning after Northumberland and Westmorland took refuge in
Liddesdale, Martin Eliot and others of the principal men of the
dale raised a force against the earls, Black Ormiston, and the
rest of their company, and offered fight; but in the end, Eliot,
wishing to avoid a feud, said to Ormiston that "he would charge
him and the rest before the Regent for keeping of the rebels of
England, if he did not put them out of the country, and that if
they [the earls] were in the country after the next day, he would
do his worst against them and all that maintained them."
Whereupon the earls were driven to quit Liddesdale and to fly to
one of the Armstrongs in the Debateable Land, leaving the
Countess of Northumberland "at John of the Sydes house, a cottage
not to be compared to any dog-kennel in England." Three days
later Sussex and Sadler write that "the Earl of Northumberland
was yesterday [the 24th], at one in the afternoon, delivered by
one Hector, of Harlaw wood, of the surname of the Armstrongs, to
Alexander Hume, to be carried to the Regent."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d176_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The Regent
took Northumberland to Edinburgh, and on the second of January,
1570, committed him to the castle of Lochleven, attended by two
servants.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d176_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The sentiment of Scotsmen, and especially of borderers, was
outraged by this proceeding: "for generally, all sorts, both men
and women, cry out for the liberty of their country; which is, to
succor banisht men, as themselves have been received in England
not long since, and is the freedom of all countries, as they
allege."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d176_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Northumberland remained in confinement at Lochleven until
June, 1572. Meanwhile the Countess of Northumberland, who had
escaped to Flanders, had been begging money to buy her husband of
the Scots, and had been negotiating with Douglas of Lochleven to
that effect. She was ready to give the sum demanded, which seems
to have been two thousand pounds, as soon as sufficient assurance
could be had that her husband would Be liberated upon payment of
the money. Lord Hunsdon discussed the surrender of Northumberland
with the Earl of Morton and the Commendator of Dunfermling, on
the occasion of their coming to Berwick to treat about the
pacification of the troubles in Scotland. "They made recital of
the charges that the lord of Lochleven hath been at with the said
earl, and how the earl hath offered the lord of Lochleven four
thousand marks sterling, to be paid presently to him in hand, to
let him go. Notwithstanding, both he and the rest shall be
delivered to her Majesty upon reasonable consideration of their
charges." (November 22, 1571.) Political considera- tions turned
the scale, and on the seventh of June Lord Hunsdon paid the two
thousand pounds which the countess had offered, and
Northumberland was put into his hands. Hunsdon had the earl in
custody at Berwick until the following August. He was then made
over to Sir John Forster, Warden of the Middle Marches, taken to
York and there beheaded (August 27th, 1572).<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d176_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The ballad-minstrel acquaints us with circumstances concerning
the surrender of Northumberland which are not known to any of the
historians. One night, when many gentlemen are supping at
Lochleveu Castle, William Douglas, the laird of the castle,
rallies the earl on account of his sadness; there is to be a
shooting in the north of Scotland the next day, and to this
Douglas has engaged his word that Percy shall go. Percy is ready
to ride to the world's end in Douglas's company. Mary Douglas,
William's sister, interposes: her brother is a traitor, and has
taken money from the Earl [Morton?] to deliver Percy to England.
Northumberland will not believe this; the surrender of a banisht
man would break friendship forever between England and Scotland.
Mary Douglas persists; he had best let her brother ride his own
way, and he can tell the English lords that he cannot be of the
party because he is in an isle of the sea (an obstacle which must
appear to us not greater for one than for the other); and while
her brother is away she will carry Percy to Edinburgh Castle, and
deliver him to Lord Hume, who has already suffered loss in his
behalf. But if he will not give credence to her, let him come on
her right hand, and she will shew him something. Percy never
loved witchcraft, but permits his chamberlain to go with the
lady. Mary Douglas's mother was a witch-woman, and had taught her
daughter something of her art. She shows the chamberlain through
the belly of a ring many Englishmen who are on the await for his
master, among them Lord Hunsdon, Sir William Drury, and Sir John
Forster, though at that moment they are thrice fifty mile
distant. The chamberlain goes back to his lord weeping, but the
relation of what he has seen produces no effect. Percy says he
has been in Lochleven almost three years and has never had an
'outrake' (outing); he will not hear a word to hinder him from
going to the shooting. He twists from his finger a gold ring left
him when he was in Harlaw wood and gives it to Mary Douglas, with
an assurance that, though he may drink, he will never eat, till
he is in Lochleven again. Mary faints when she sees him in the
boat, and Percy once and again proposes to go back to see how she
fares; but William Douglas treats the fainting very lightly; his
sister is crafty enough to beguile thousands like them. When they
have sailed the first fifty mile (it will be borne in mind that
the Douglas castle is described as being on an isle of the sea),
James Swynard, the chamberlain,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d176_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> asks how far it is to the
shooting, and gets an alarming answer: fair words make fools
fain; whenever they come to the shooting, they will think they
have come soon enough! Jamie carries this answer to his master,
who finds nothing discouraging in it; it was meant only to try
his mettle. But after sailing fifty miles more, Percy himself
calls to Douglas and asks what his purpose is. " Look that your
bridle be strong and your spurs be sharp," says Douglas (but 49 1
is probably corrupted). "This is mere flouting," replies Percy;
"one Armstrong has my horse, another my spurs and all my gear."
Fifty miles more of the sea, and they land Lord Percy at Berwick,
a deported, "extradited" man!</p>

<p>14. The Countess of Northumberland was sheltered for some time
at Hume Castle (Sir C. Sharp's Memorials, pp. 143, 146, 150, 344,
ff). The castle was invested, and by direction of Lord Hume, then
absent in Edinburgh, was surrendered without resistance, in the
course of Sussex's destructive raid in April, 1570. Cabala, ed.
1663, p. 175. See also Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 170.</p>

<p>19. Witchcraft was rife at the epoch of this ballad, nor was
the imputation of it confined to hags of humble life. The Lady
Buccleuch, the Countess of Athole, and the Lady Foullis were all
accused of practising the black art. Nothing in that way was
charged upon Lady Douglas of Lochleven, the mother of William
Douglas and of the Regent Murray; but Lady Janet Douglas, sister
of the Earl of Angus, had been burnt in 1537 for meditating the
death of James V by poison or witchcraft, and it is possible, as
Percy has suggested, that this occurrence may have led to the
attribution of sorcery to Lady Douglas of Lochleven.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d176_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Mary Douglas shows Northumberland's chamberlain, through the
hollow of her ring, the English lords who are waiting for his
master "thrice fifty mile" distant, at Berwick. In a Swiss
popular song the infidelity of a lover is revealed by a look
through a finger-ring. People on the Odenberg hear a drum-beat,
but see nothing. A wizard makes one' after another look through a
ring made by bowing the arm against the side; they see armed men
going into and coming out of the hill. So Biarco is enabled to
see Odin on his white horse by looking through Ruta's bent
arm.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d176_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>32, 33. The day after Northumberland was put into his hands,
Hunsdon writes to Burghley: "For the earl, I have had no great
talk with him; but truly he seems to follow his old humours,
readier to talk of hawks and hounds than anything else." (Sharp,
p. 330.)</p>

<p>51. It was their old manner, as Robin Hood says, to leave but
little behind; but what is recorded is that, when " the earls
were driven to leave Liddesdale and to fly to one of the
Armstrongs upon the Bateable, ... the Liddesdale men stole my
lady of North- umberland's horse, and her two women's horses, and
ten other horses." Sussex to Cecil, Sharp, p. 114 f.</p>

<p>52. Percy "left Lochleven with joy, under the assurance that
he should be conveyed in a Scottish vessel to Antwerp. To his
surprise and dismay he found himself, after a short voyage, at
Coldingham." Lingard's History, VI, 137, London, 1854.</p>
