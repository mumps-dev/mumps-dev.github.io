<h3>Fragments</h3>

<p>"Dispersed thro Shakspere's plays are innumerable little
fragments of ancient ballads, the entire copies of which could
not be recovered," says Bishop Percy in his preface to 'The Friar
of Orders Gray.' What he says of Shakspere is equally true of
Beaumont and Fletcher, but it is not true, in either case, that
there are many fragments of popular traditional ballads. Portions
of ballads of one kind or another, and still more of songs, are
introduced into the plays of these authors, though not so
frequently as one would suppose from Percy's words. Ten of the
twenty-eight stanzas of 'The Friar of Orders Gray' are taken,
mostly in part only, from Shakspere and Fletcher,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v5p11_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> but the
original verses are from songs, not properly from ballads. It is
not, however, always easy to say whether an isolated stanza
belonged to a ballad or a song. Some snatches from familiar
ballads, which occur in Beaumont and Fletcher, have already been
given at the proper places. A few bits from unknown pieces, which
occur in Shakspere, or Beaumont and Fletcher (strictly, perhaps,
Fletcher), will be given here. It is surprising that other
dramatists have not furnished something.</p>

<p>A very meagre gathering of fragments from other sources
follows those which have been gleaned from the dramatists, but it
must be once more said that there is not an absolute certainty
that all of these belong to ballads.</p>

<p>Some popular tales are interspersed with verses of a ballad
character, and one or two cases have been incidentally noted
already. Examples are 'The Paddo,' Chambers's Popular Rhymes of
Scotland, 1870, p. 87;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v5p11_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> 'The Red Etin,' <i>ib.</i> p. 89;

<p>The History of the Houses of Douglas and Angus, written by
Master David Hume of Godscroft, p. 155, Edinburgh, 1644.</p>

<p>Of the treacherous execution of William, sixth Earl of
Douglas, at the castle of Edinburgh, in 1440, Hume of Godscroft
says: "It is sure the people did abhorre it, execrating the very
place where it was done; in detestation of the fact of which the
memory remaineth yet to our dayes in these words." Since Hume
mentions no ballad, it is not likely that he knew of more than
this single stanza, or that more existed. (Sir Walter Scott,
however, confidently assumes that there was a ballad. Minstrelsy,
1833, I, 221 f.)</p>

<p>A "romantic ballad, of which, unfortunately, one stanza only
has been preserved. The tradition bears that a young lady was
carried away by the fairies, and that, although invisible to her
friends who were in search of her, she was sometimes heard by
them lamenting her destiny in a pathetic song, of which the
stanza just mentioned runs nearly thus:"</p>

<p>sung in Wuthering Heights, ch. 9, has not unnaturally been
taken for a relic of a traditional Scottish ballad of a dead
mother returning to her abused children. It is, in fact, a stanza
(not literally well remembered) from the Danish ballad 'Moderen
under Mulde,' Grundtvig, II, 470, No 89, B 11, translated by
Jamieson, and given in the notes to the fourth canto of Scott's
Lady of the Lake.</p>

<p>The following "fragment," given in Motherwell's Manuscript, p.
184, "from Mr. William Steele of Greenock, advocate," I suppose
to have been the effort of a self-satisfied amateur, and to have
been written as a fragment. The third and fourth stanzas recall
the broadside ballad 'The Lady Isabella's Tragedy.'</p>
