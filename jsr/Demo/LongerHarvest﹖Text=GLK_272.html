<h3>272. The Suffolk Miracle</h3>

<p>This ballad is, in a blurred, enfeebled, and disfigured shape,
the representative in England of one of the most remarkable tales
and one of the most impressive and beautiful ballads of the
European continent. The relationship is put beyond doubt by the
existence of a story in Cornwall which comes much nearer to the
Continental tale.</p>

<p>Long, long ago, Frank, a farmer's son, was in love with Nancy,
a very attractive girl, who lived in the condition of a superior
servant in his mother's house. Frank's parents opposed their
matching, and sent the girl home to her mother; but the young
pair continued to meet, and they bound themselves to each other
for life or for death. To part them effectually, Frank was
shipped for an India voyage. He could not write, and nothing was
heard of him for nearly three years. On All-hallows-Eve Nancy
went out with two companions to sow hemp-seed. Nancy began the
rite, saying:</p>

<p>Hemp-seed, I sow thee,<br/> Hemp-seed, grow thee!<br/> And he
who will my true-love be<br/> Come after me<br/> And shaw
thee.</p>

<p>This she said three times, and then, looking back over her
left shoulder, she saw Frank indeed, but he looked so angry that
she shrieked, and so broke the spell. One night in November a
ship was wrecked on the coast, and Frank was cast ashore, with
311st enough life in him to ask that he might be married to Nancy
before he died, a wish which was not to be fulfilled. On the
night of his funeral, as Nancy was about to lock the house-door,
a horseman rode up. His face was deadly pale, but Nancy knew him
to be her lover. He told her that he had just arrived home, and
had come to fetch her and make her his bride. Nancy was easily
induced to spring on the horse behind him. When she clasped
Frank's waist, her arm became stiff as ice. The horse went at a
furious pace; the moon came out in full splendor. Nancy saw that
the rider was in grave-clothes. She had lost the power of speech,
but, passing a blacksmith's shop, where the smith was still at
work, she recovered voice and cried, Save me! with all her might.
The smith ran out with a hot iron in his hand, and, as the horse
was rushing by, caught the girl's dress and pulled her to the
ground. But the rider held on to the gown, and both Nancy and the
smith were dragged on till they came near the churchyard. There
the horse stopped for a moment, and the smith seized his chance
to burn away the gown with his iron and free the girl. The
horseman passed over the wall of the churchyard, and vanished at
the grave in which the young man had been laid a few hours
before. A piece of Nancy's dress was found on the grave. Nancy
died before morning. It was said that one or two of the sailors
who survived the wreck testified that Frank, on Halloween, was
like one mad, and, after great excitement, lay for hours as if
dead, and that when he came to himself he declared that if he
ever married the woman who had cast the spell, he would make her
suffer for drawing his soul out of his body. (Popular Romances of
the West of England, collected and edited by Robert Hunt, First
Series, pp. 265-7. dating from about 1830.) A tale of a dead man
coming on horseback to his inconsolable love, and carrying her to
his grave, is widely spread among the Slavic people and the
Austrian Germans, was well known a century ago among the northern
Germans, and has lately been recovered in the Netherlands,
Denmark, Iceland, and Brittany. Besides the tale in its
integrity, certain verses which occur in it, and which are of a
kind sure to impress the memory, are very frequent, and these
give evidence of a very extensive distribution. The verses are to
this effect:</p>

<p>The moon shines bright in the lift,<br/> The dead, they ride
so swift,<br/> Love, art thou not afraid?<br/> to which the
lovelorn maid answers,<br/> How fear, when I am with thee?</p>

<p>A portion (or portions) of a Low German tale of this class,
the verses and a little more, was the basis of Burger's 'Lenore,'
composed in 1773. There are also ballads with the same story, one
in German, several in Slavic, but these have not so original a
stamp as the tale, and have perhaps sprung from it.</p>

<p>In marked and pleasing contrast with most of the versions of
this tale, in so many copies grotesque and ferocious, is a
dignified and tender ballad, in which the lovers are replaced by
brother and sister. This ballad is found among the Servians,
Bulgarians, Greeks, Albanians, and Roumanians. Professor
Schischmanov (Indogermanische Forschungen, iv, 412-48, 1S94)
makes out a very strong probability of the derivation of all the
ballads of 'The Dead Brother' from the Greek.</p>
