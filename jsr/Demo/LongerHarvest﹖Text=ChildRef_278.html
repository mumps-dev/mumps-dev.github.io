<h3>The Farmer's Curst Wife</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>The Farmer's Old Wife,' Dixon, Ancient Poems, 
Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England, p. 
210, Percy Society, vol. xvii. The same in Bell, 
p. 204. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d27801.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
<li>Macmath Manuscript, p. 96. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d27802.html"><i>Version B</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>The devil comes for a farmer's wife and is made welcome to her
by the husband. The woman proves to be no more controllable in
hell than she had been at home; she kicks the imps about, and
even brains a set of them with her pattens or a maul. For
safety's sake, the devil is constrained to take her back to her
husband.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. The ballad of 'Kellyburnbraes,' Johnson's Museum, No
379, p. 392, was composed by Burns, as he has himself informed
us, "from the old traditional version." "The original ballad,
still preserved by tradition," says David Laing, "was much
improved in passing through Burns's hands:" Museum, IV, *389,
1853. Cromek, Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song, p. 83,
1810, gives us what he calls the "Original of Burns's Carle of
Kelly-Burn Braes," remarking, with some effrontery, that there is
reason to believe that Burns had not seen the whole of the verses
which constitute this copy. Allan Cunningham, Songs of Scotland,
II, 199, undertook "to make a more complete version than has
hitherto appeared" out of Burns, Cromek, and some "fugitive
copies." So we get the original from none of them, but are,
rather, further from it at each step. Whether <b>B</b> has come
down pure, unaffected by Burns and Cromek, it is impossible to
say. That it shows resemblances to both copies is not against its
genuineness, if there was a fair leaven of the popular ballad in
each of these reconstructions; and it is probable that there
would be, at least in Burns's.</p>

<p>A curst wife who was a terror to demons is a feature in a
widely spread and highly humorous tale, Oriental and European.
See Benfey, Pantschatantra, I, 519-34; and, for a variety which
is, at the beginning, quite close to our ballad, Ralston, Russian
Folk-Tales, p. 39 (Afanasief, I, No 9).</p>

<p>Cromek's ballad is translated by Wolff, Halle der V&ouml;lker,
I, 93, Hausschatz, p. 230.</p>
