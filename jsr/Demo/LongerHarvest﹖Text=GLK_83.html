<h3>83. Child Maurice</h3>

<p><b>A</b> is from the Percy Manuscript of <b>B</b> Motherwell
says (1827): "By testimony of a most unexceptionable description,
but which it would be tedious here to detail, the editor can
distinctly trace this ballad as existing in its present shape at
least a century ago." The ballad was printed at Glasgow by Foulis
in 1755 (and in an earlier edition, now lost), with considerable
modern improvements. Hume's trag-edy of Douglas, produced in
Edinburgh in 1 756, was founded upon the story, and the
popularity of the play seems to have given vogue to the ballad.
The sophisticated copy passed into recitation, and may very
likely have more or less infected those which were repeated from
earlier tradition. The poet Gray writes to Mason, June, 1757 (?):
"I have got the old Scottish ballad on which Douglas was founded;
it is divine, and as long as from here [Cambridge] to Aston." He
quotes the first fifteen lines, substantially as in Foulis.
Percy's version in the Reliques, 1765 (in, 93), is that of Foulis
with further "improvements."</p>
