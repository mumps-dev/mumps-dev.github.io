<h3>20. The Cruel Mother - Appendix</h3>

<h3>Lady Anne</h3>

<p>"This ballad was communicated to me by Mr. Kirkpatrick Sharpe
of Hoddom, who mentions having copied it from an old magazine.
Although it has probably received some modern corrections, the
general turn seems to be ancient, and corresponds with that of a
fragment [<b>B</b> <b>b</b>], which I have often heard sung in my
childhood." Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, m, 259, ed.
1803.</p>

<p>Buchan, Gleanings, p. 90, has an additional stanza between 8
and 9 of Scott's, whether from the old magazine or not, it would
not be worth the while to ascertain.</p>

<p>Cunningham, Songs of Scotland, I, 339, has rewritten even
'Lady Anne.'</p>

<p>Translated by Schubart, p. 170, and by Gerhard, p. 92.</p>

<p>"There are many variations of this affecting tale. One of them
appears in the Musical Museum, and is there called 'Fine Flowers
of the Valley,' of which the present is either the original or a
parallel song. I am inclined to think it is the original."
