<p>A young man loved a farmer's daughter, and his love was
returned. The girl's father sent her to his brother's, forty
miles off, to stay till she should change her mind. The man died.
A month after, he appeared at the uncle's at midnight, and, as he
came on her father's horse and brought with him her mother's
travelling gear, he was allowed to take the girl away with him.
As they rode, he complained of headache, and the girl bound her
handkerchief about his head; he was cold as clay. In two hours
they were at her father's door. The man went to put up the horse,
as he said, but no more was seen of him. The girl knocked, and
her father came down, much astonished to see her, and still more
astonished when she asked if her lover, known by the father to be
dead, had not been sent to bring her. The father went to the
stable, where the girl said the man would be; there was nobody
there, but the horse was found to be 'all on a sweat.' After
conferences, the grave was opened, and the kerchief was found
about the head of the mouldering body. This was told to the girl,
and she died shortly after. This piece could not be admitted here
on its own merits. At the first look, it would be classed with
the vulgar prodigies printed for hawkers to sell and for Mopsa
and Dorcas to buy. It is not even a good specimen of its kind.
Ghosts should have a fair reason for walking, and a quite
particular reason for riding. In popular fictions, the motive for
their leaving the grave is to ask back plighted troth, to be
relieved from the inconveniences caused by the excessive grief of
the living, to put a stop to the abuse of children by
stepmothers, to repair an injustice done in the flesh, to fulfil
a promise; at the least, to announce the visitant's death. One
would not be captious with the restlessness of defeated love, but
what object is there in this young man's rising from the grave to
take his love from her uncle's to her father's house? And what
sense is there in his headache?</p>

<p>I have printed this ballad because, in a blurred, enfeebled,
and disfigured shape, it is the representative in England of one
of the most remarkable tales and one of the most impressive and
beautiful ballads of the European continent. The relationship is
put beyond doubt by the existence of a story in Cornwall which
comes much nearer to the Continental tale.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d272_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Long, long ago, Frank, a farmer's son, was in love with Nancy,
a very attractive girl, who lived in the condition of a superior
servant in his mother's house. Frank's parents opposed their
matching, and sent the girl home to her mother; but the young
pair continued to meet, and they bound themselves to each other
for life or for death. To part them effectually, Frank was
shipped for an India voyage. He could not write, and nothing was
heard of him for nearly three years. On All-hallows-Eve Nancy
went out with two companions to sow hemp-seed. Nancy began the
rite, saying:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Hemp-seed, I sow thee,<br/>
Hemp-seed, grow thee!<br/>
And he who will my true-love be<br/>
Come after me<br/>
And shaw thee.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>This she said three times, and then, looking back over her
left shoulder, she saw Frank indeed, but he looked so angry that
she shrieked, and so broke the spell. One night in November a
ship was wrecked on the coast, and Frank was cast ashore, with
just enough life in him to ask that he might be married to Nancy
before he died, a wish which was not to be fulfilled. On the
night of his funeral, as Nancy was about to lock the house-door,
a horseman rode up. His face was deadly pale, but Nancy knew him
to be her lover. He told her that he had just arrived home, and
had come to fetch her and make her his bride. Nancy was easily
induced to spring on the horse behind him. When she clasped
Frank's waist, her arm became stiff as ice. The horse went at a
furious pace; the moon came out in full splendor. Nancy saw that
the rider was in grave-clothes. She had lost the power of speech,
but, passing a blacksmith's shop, where the smith was still at
work, she recovered voice and cried, Save me! with all her might.
The smith ran out with a hot iron in his hand, and, as the horse
was rushing by, caught the girl's dress and pulled her to the
ground. But the rider held on to the gown, and both Nancy and the
smith were dragged on till they came near the churchyard. There
the horse stopped for a moment, and the smith seized his chance
to burn away the gown with his iron and free the girl. The
horseman passed over the wall of the churchyard, and vanished at
the grave in which the young man had been laid a few hours
before. A piece of Nancy's dress was found on the grave. Nancy
died before morning. It was said that one or two of the sailors
who survived the wreck testified that Frank, on Halloween, was
like one mad, and, after great excitement, lay for hours as if
dead, and that when he came to himself he declared that if he
ever married the woman who had cast the spell, he would make her
suffer for drawing his soul out of his body.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d272_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A tale of a dead man coming on horseback to his inconsolable
love, and carrying her to his grave, is widely spread among the
Slavic people (with whom it seems to have originated) and the
Austrian Germans, was well known a century ago among the northern
Germans, and has lately been recovered in the Netherlands,
Denmark, Iceland, and Brittany. Besides the tale in its
integrity, certain verses which occur in it, and which are of a
kind sure to impress the memory, are very frequent, and these
give evidence of a very extensive distribution. The verses are to
this effect:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>The moon shines bright in the lift,<br/>
The dead, they ride so swift,<br/>
Love, art thou not afraid?</td></tr>

</table>

<p>to which the lovelorn maid answers,</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>How fear, when I am with thee?<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d272_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></td></tr>

</table>

<p>There are also ballads with the same story, one in German,
several in Slavic, but these have not so original a stamp as the
tale, and have perhaps sprung from it.</p>

<p>The following will serve as specimens of the tale in question;
many more may certainly be recovered:</p>

<p>A lover, who has long been unheard of, but whose death has not
been ascertained, roused from his last sleep by the grief of his
mistress (which in some cases drives her to seek or accept the
aid of a spell), comes to her by night on horseback and induces
her to mount behind him. As they ride, he says several times to
her, The moon shines bright, the dead ride swift, art not afraid?
Believing him to be living, the maid protests that she feels no
fear, but at last becomes alarmed. He takes her to his
burial-place, and tries to drag her into his grave; she escapes,
and takes refuge in a dead-house (or house where a dead man is
lying). The lover pursues, and calls upon the dead man within the
house to give her up, which in most cases, for fellowship, he
prepares to do. At the critical moment a cock crows, and the maid
is saved.</p>

<p>Some of the tales are brief and defective, some mixed with
foreign matter. The predominant traits, with a few details and
variations, may be briefly exhibited by a synoptical analysis.</p>

<p>A pair of lovers are plighted to belong to each other in life
and death, 50, 51, 57; whichever dies first is to visit the
other, 48; the man, at parting, promises to come back, alive or
dead, 25, 26. The man dies in war, 1, 2, 10, 14, 15, 17, 20-22,
25-29, 31, 32, 36, 39, 42, 45-52; the maid, her lover not
returning, grieves incessantly, 4, 6-13, 15-18, 28, 29, 32, 49,
53. (The return of the lover is enforced by a spell, recommended
or conducted by an old woman, 22, 28, 36, 39, 41, 45, advised by
a priest, 20, 21, worked by the maid, 33; a dead man's head,
bones, carcass, boiled in a pot, 15-17, 20, 21, 22, 27, 39, a
piece of the man's clothing, 28, a cat burned in a red-hot oven,
33.) The man comes on horseback, mostly at night; she mounts with
him, 1-5, 8-12, 14-23, 25-32, 36-44, 46, 48-53, 56-58, taking
with her a bundle of clothes, smocks, etc., 1, 6, 7, 9, 16, 17,
21, 23, 24, 26, 32, 35, 36, 38. (There are two horses, 45; they
go off in coach or wagon, 6, 7, 13, 24, 33; stag for horse, 47;
afoot, 35, 54.) As they go, the man says or sings once or more,
The moon shines bright, the dead ride fast, art thou afraid? and
she answers that with him she has no fear. The verses occur in
some form in all copies but 2, 3, 9, 11, 13, 15, 29, 32, 33, 38,
40, 51, and are mostly well preserved. (It is a voice from the
churchyard in 38.)</p>

<p>Arrived at a grave in a churchyard, the man bids the maid to
go in, 2, 4-6, 8, 10-17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 32, 36, 39; she
says, You first, 2, 4-6, 8, 11-17, 23, 24, 32, 36, 39; she will
first throw him her things, and then come, 14; she throws in her
bundle of things, 1, 5, 23, 24, 26, 32, 36; hands them to him one
after another, 6, 7, 16, 17; tells him to take her by the hands,
and reaches out to him the sleeves of her gown, 2, 12; gives him
the end of a piece of linen or of a ball of thread to pull at,
16, 19; asks him to spread her kerchief in the grave to make the
frozen ground softer, 27, all this to gain time. He tears her
things in the grave, 9, 13, 24; he seizes her apron, clutches her
clothes, to drag her in, 4, 8, 21, 22, 25, 43, 44, 47, 48 (in 4
she cuts the apron in two, in 8 tears her gown off, in 25, 43,
44, 48, her apron parts); she runs off, 19, 11, 13-17, 20-27, 29,
30, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 45, 46, 48, 50; she throws down articles
of dress to delay his pursuit, he tears them, 9, 13, 18, 38.</p>

<p>The maid takes refuge in a dead-house (or house in which there
is a dead body, or two, or three), 1-4, 6, 8, 11-15, 17, 18,
20-22, 24-27, 29, 30, 32, 34-36, 38, 39, 41, 45, 46 (malt-kiln,
5, house of vampire, 16). She climbs on to the stove, or hides
behind it, 6-8, 11, 13-16, 21, 24, 26, 32, 34, 36, 39, 41. The
dead lover calls to the dead in the house to open, hand her out,
4, 6, 8, 11, 17, 20-22, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 35, 36, 38, 39,
41, 45, 46, 48, 50, 57 (to seize the girl, 11; to tear her to
pieces, 24); the dead man within is disposed to help his comrade,
makes an effort so to do, 11, 29, 34, 41, 45, 46; opens the door,
6, 21, 36, 39; is prevented from helping because the maid has
laid her cross, scapular, on his coffin, 4, 17; (two dead,
because she has laid her rosary on the feet of one, her
prayer-book on the feet of the other, 32;) the maid throws at him
beads from her rosary, which check his movements until the string
is exhausted; the maid puts up three effectual prayers, 35; Ave
sounds, 48; by the maid's engaging his attention with a long
tale, 38; because his wife or a watcher knocks him on the head,
and orders him to lie where he is, 20, 30; because his wife has
turned him over on his face, 57. In a few cases the dead man
within inclines to protect the maid, 1, 22, 25; the two get into
a fight, 1, 13-15, 17, 26, 36 (quarrel, 7). The cock crows, and
the dead fall powerless, return to their places, turn to pitch,
vanish, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13-15, 17, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32,
34-36, 39, 41, 45, 46, and the maid is saved.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d272_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>In some of the tales of this section the maid is not so
fortunate: in 6, the two dead take her by the legs and tear her
asunder; in 21, the lover tears her, the dead man in the house
having surrendered her. In 39, the lover, having been let in,
says to the other dead man, Let us tear her to pieces, and is
proceeding to do so, but is stopped by the cock. She dies of
shock, or after a few days, 8, 11, 13, 16, 17, 29, 31, 32, 36.</p>

<p>The maid's escape assured, in one way or another, the man
calls to her, Your good luck: I would have taught you to weep for
the dead (he had been tearing her things in the grave, and her
shift, which she had dropped to delay his pursuit), 9. Your body
would have been rent into as many bits as your smocks (a bit was
found on every grave in the church-yard), 22, 35. I would have
torn you into a thousand tatters. I was all but saved, and have
had to come so far! Then he warned her never again to long for
the dead, 42. I would have taught you to disturb the dead, 41. It
was her luck, for she would have been torn into a thousand bits,
like her apron. Let this be a warning to you, says Our Lady to
the girl, never to mourn so much again for the dead, for he had a
hard journey to make, 43. He tore a portion of her gown into a
thousand pieces, and laid one on every grave, saying, You were
not so much a simpleton to mourn for me as I was not to tear you
to pieces, 30. There was on every grave a bit of her gown, from
which we may see how it would have fared with her, 31.</p>

<p>Resentment for the disturbance caused by the maid's excessive
grief is expressed also in 6, Since you have wept so much for me,
creep into my grave; in 12, she has troubled him by her perpetual
weeping, he will take her where he dwells; in 20, Another time do
not long for my dead body; in 27, You have mourned for me, now
sleep with me; in 32, the maid's continual weeping is a burden to
her lover in his grave. In 40, the remon- strance is affectionate
and like (suspiciously like) that of Helgi and of Sir Aage (II,
235).</p>

<p>In some copies the story closes at the grave, 2, 10, 19, 23,
28, 40, 43, 44, 47, 49, 51, 52, 54, 56, 58; many of these,
however, are brief and defective. The man lays himself in the
grave, which closes, she flies, 23; he descends into the grave
and tries to draw her in by her apron, the apron tears, she
faints, and is found lying on the ground the next morning, 43; he
descends into the grave and tries to draw her after him, she
resists, the grave closes, and she remains without, 47; he
disappears, she is left alone, 49, 52. She goes into the grave,
remains there, and dies, 10; the grave opens, he pushes or drags
her in, 54; both disappear in the grave, 56; the horse rushes
three times round in a ring, and they are nowhere, 53; she is
killed by the man, her flesh torn off, and her bones broken,
51.</p>

<p>The maid finds herself in a strange land, 44, 47; she is among
people of different language, 26, 28, 29, 45; nobody knows of the
place which she says she came from, 27; she is a long time in
getting home, and nobody knows her then, 25; she is years in
going home (from two to nine), 20, 22, 28, 46. The man and woman
are a married pair in 2, 3, 23, 44, 45; in 44, the woman has
married a second time, contrary to a mutual agreement. 10, 12,
16, 18, 19, have a taint of vampirism, and in 2 a stake is driven
through the body of the man after he has returned to his grave,
as was done with vampires.</p>

<p>In 31, the maid throws herself from the horse, the man,
holding to her gown, tears off a large piece of it, and bits of
the gown are found on every grave the next day; so in the Cornish
tale, when the maid is pulled from the horse, the man retains a
portion of her gown, and a piece is found on his grave. In 27,
the maid's kerchief is found in the man's grave, and serves to
corroborate her story; so in the Suffolk tale, with the
handkerchief which the maid had bound round the man's head. 55, a
brief and corrupted copy, compares very well with the Suffolk
tale for pointlessness. The man comes on his father's horse,
takes the girl on, and rides with her all round the village.
Towards morning he brings the maid back to her chamber, and the
horse to the stable, and goes where he came from.</p>

<p>As I have already said, the ballads seem less original than
the tales; that is, to have been made from tales, as 'The Suffolk
Miracle' was. 5, 7, 10, are of the vulgar sort, like the English
piece, 7 having perhaps received literary touches. In none of
them does the maid fly and the man pursue; the catastrophe is at
the grave.</p>

<p>The lovers have sworn mutual faith, 5, 10; the maid wishes
that the man may come back, dead or living, 3, 10, 12; even from
hell, 6.</p>

<p>The man has fallen in war, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12.</p>

<p>A spell is employed to bring him back, 1, 2, 6, 9.</p>

<p>He comes on a horse, 3, 4, 6-8, 11, 12; in a wagon, 5, 10; on
foot, 1, 2, 9.</p>

<p>The verses found in the tales occur in 3 (three times), 4, 5,
6, 12; in 10, a voice from the clouds cries, What hast thou done,
to be going off with a dead man?</p>

<p>She is taken to a graveyard. The grave closes over the man,
she is left without, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12; both go into the grave, 4,
6, 7, 11.</p>

<p>She breathes out her soul on the grave, 3; she finds herself
in the morning in a strange land, of different speech, is seven
years in going home, 12.</p>

<p>1, 2, 9, are varieties of one ballad. The man asks the maid to
go out with him to the dark wood, 1; to the cherry-tree (trees),
2, 9. After a time, he tells her to go back, he is no longer her
lover, but a devil; she turns to dust, 1; the cock crows, he
tells her to go home and not look round, to thank God for the
cock, because he should have cut off her head, he is no longer
her lover but a devil, 2. In 9, the man says his head aches
badly, for, after mouldering six years, she had forced him to
rise by her spell. The maid tells her mother that her lover is
buried under the cherry-trees, mass is said for him; he returns
to give thanks for his redemption from hell.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d272_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Reverting now to the English tales, we perceive that the
Cornish is a very fairly well-preserved specimen of the extensive
cycle which has been epitomized. Possibly the full moonshine is a
relic of the weird verses which occur in so many copies. The
hemp-seed rite is clearly a displacement and perversion of the
spell resorted to in five Slavic and two German copies to compel
the return of the dead man. It has no sense otherwise, for the
maid did not need to know who was to be her lover; she was
already bound to one for life and death. The ballad was made up
from an imperfect and confused tradition. In pointlessness and
irrationality it easily finds a parallel in the 55th tale, as
already remarked. The hood and safeguard brought by the ghost
represent the clothes which the girl takes with her in numerous
copies. Remembering the 9th ballad, where the revenant complains
of a headache, caused by the powerful enchantment which had been
brought to bear on him, we may quite reasonably suppose that the
headache in 'The Suffolk Miracle,' utterly absurd to all
appearance, was in fact occasioned by a spell which has dropped
away from the Suffolk story, but is retained in the Cornish.</p>

<p>M. Paul S&eacute;billot has recently (in 1879) taken down, in
that part of Brittany where French is exclusively spoken, a tale
which is almost a repetition of the English ballad, and which for
that reason has been kept by itself, 'Les Deux Fianc&eacute;s,'
Litt&eacute;rature orale de la Haute-Bretagne, p. 197. A young
man and a maid have plighted themselves to marry and to be
faithful to one another even after death. The young man, who is a
sailor, goes on a voyage, and dies without her learning the fact.
One night he leaves his tomb, and comes on a white mare, taken
from her father's stable, to get the girl, who is living at a
farm at some distance from her own home. The girl mounts behind
him: as they go he says, The moon is bright, death is riding with
you, are you not afraid? and she answers, I am not afraid, since
you are with me. He complains of a headache; she ties her
handkerchief round his head. They arrive at the girl's home; she
gets down and knocks. To an inquiry, Who is there? she replies,
Your daughter, whom you sent for by my husband that is to be. I
have come on horseback with him, and lent him my handkerchief on
the way, since he had none. He is now in the stable attending to
the horse. They go to the stable and find the mare in a sweat,
but no man. The girl then understands that her lover is dead, and
she dies, too. They open the man's grave to bury the two
together, and find the girl's handkerchief on his head. This is
the English ballad over again, almost word for word, with the
difference that the lover dies at sea, and that the substance of
the notable verses is preserved.</p>

<p>In marked and pleasing contrast with most of the versions of
the tale with which we have been dealing, in so many copies
grotesque and ferocious, with a lover who, from impulses not
always clear, from resentment sometimes that his comfort has been
disturbed by her unrestrained grief, sometimes that she has been
implicated in forcing him by magic to return to the world which
he had done with, is bent on tearing his lass to pieces, is a
dignified and tender ballad, in which the lovers are replaced by
brother and sister. This ballad is found among the Servians,
Bulgarians, Greeks, and Albanians, and is very common among the
Greeks, both of the mainland and the islands.</p>

<p>A mother has nine sons and an only daughter. The daughter is
sought in marriage; the mother and eight of her sons wish to
match her in their neighborhood, but the youngest son (whom it
will be convenient to call Constantine) has his way, and she is
given to a suitor from a distant country (often Babylon). The
brothers are to visit their sister often (Slavic); Constantine
promises to bring her to his mother should there be special
occasion. A fatal year comes, and all the brothers die of the
plague (in a few cases they are killed in war). The mother chants
laments at the graves of the eight, strews flowers, burns
candles, gives alms for their souls; at Constantine's grave she
tears her hair. She curses Constantine for the distant marriage,
and demands of him her daughter. God takes pity (on mother,
sister, or son). The stone over his grave (his coffin, a board
for the grave, his shroud, a cloud) is turned into a horse; he
goes to his sister and informs her that she is wanted by her
mother. The sister will put on gold for joy or black for grief;
she is to come as she stands. (He tries to prevent her going, in
the Servian copies, where his object is to pay the promised
visit.) On the way the sister notes that Constantine is gray with
mould, he smells of earth, his skin is black, his eyes are dull,
his hair is dusty, his hair or teeth fallen out; why is this? He
has been at work in the ground, has been building nine white
houses, there has been dust, wind, and rain on the road, he has
had long watches, sore sickness. He smells of incense, too; that
is because he has been at church lately. Birds call out in human
voice as they pass, What wonder is this, the living travelling
with the dead! (Thrice in Romaic, 9, 10, and the Albanian tale,
twice in Romaic 13.) The sister asks Constantine if he hears what
the birds are saying; he hears, they are birds, let them talk.
They near their mother's house; a church is hard by. Constantine
bids his sister go on; he must say a prayer in the church, or pay
a votive candle, find a ring which he lost there, see to his
horse; he disappears. The house is locked, the windows shut,
there is every sign of desolation and neglect. The daughter
knocks; the mother, from within, cries, Avaunt, Death! I have no
more children! The daughter cries, It is I.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d272_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Who brought you?
Constantine. Constantine is dead; (has been dead three days,
forty days, five months, twelve years!) The mother opens, they
die in a mutual embrace (the mo- ther dies, one dies within, one
without).</p>

<p>'Le Fr&egrave;re de Lait,' Villemarqu&eacute;, Barzaz Breiz,
No 22, p. 163, ed. 1867, has no claim to be associated with these
ballads, the only feature in which it has similarity not being
genuine. Compare 'La Femme aux deux Maris,' Luzel, Gwerziou
Breiz-Izel, I, 266-71, two versions, and II, 165-69, two more;
and see Luzel, De l'authenticit&eacute; des chants du
