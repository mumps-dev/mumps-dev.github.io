<p>Denham, Tracts, II, 190, refers to a Northumbrian version of
the ballad which associated Long Lonkin with Nafferton Castle in
the parish of Ovingham. He also gives a story, obtained from an
old man in Newcastle, according to which Long Lonkin is no mason
but a gentleman, who kills the lady and her one child because the
lord of Nafferton had been preferred to him. The husband,
abandoning his journey to London on account of a misgiving that
all was not right at home, after finding his wife and child dead,
hunts down the murderer, who drops from a tree in which he had
concealed himself into a pool, thence called Long Lonkin's pool,
and is drowned.</p>

<p>Communicated by Mr. W.W. Newell, with the superscription (by
the original transcriber, Miss Emma M. Backus) "as sung in
Newbern, North Carolina, seventy-five years ago" (1895).</p>

And murder all his kinsmen.</td></tr>
