<p><b>B</b> is given in Ritson's Robin Hood, 1795, II, 183, "from
a collation of two different copies" of a York garland,
"containing numerous variations, a few of which are retained in
the margin."</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Robin Hood is ailing, and is convinced that the only
course for him is to go to Kirklees priory for blooding. Will
Scarlet cannot counsel this, unless his master take fifty bowmen
with him; for a yeoman lives there with whom there is sure to be
a quarrel. Robin bids Scarlet stay at home, if he is afraid.
Scarlet, seeing that his master is wroth, will say no more.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d120_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
Robin Hood will have no one go with him but Little John, who
shall carry his bow. John proposes that they shall shoot for a
penny along the way, and Robin assents.</p>

<p>The opening of the ballad resembles that of Robin Hood and the
Monk. There Robin's soul is ill at ease, as here his body, and he
resolves to go to Nottingham for mass; Much, the Miller's son,
advises a guard of twelve yeomen; Robin will take none with him
except John, to bear his bow;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d120_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and John suggests that they
shall shoot for a penny as they go.</p>

<p>A very interesting passage of the story here followed, of
which we can barely guess the contents, owing to nine stanzas
having been torn away. Robin Hood and John keep up their shooting
all the way, until they come to a black water, crossed by a
plank. On the plank an old woman is kneeling, and banning Robin
Hood. Robin Hood asks why, but the answer is lost, and it is not
probable that we shall ever know: out of her proper malignancy,
surely, or because she is a hired witch, for Robin is the friend
of lowly folk. But if this old woman is banning, others, no doubt
women, are weeping, for somehow they have learned that he is to
be let blood that day at the priory, and foresee that ill will
come of it. Robin is disturbed by neither banning nor weeping;
the prioress is his cousin, and would not harm him for the world.
So they shoot on until they come to Kirklees.</p>

<p>Robin makes the prioress a present of twenty pound, with a
promise of more when she wants, and she falls to work with her
bleeding-irons. The thick blood comes, and then the thin, and
Robin knows that there has been treason. John asks, What cheer?
Robin answers, Little good. Nine stanzas are again wanting, and
again in a place where we are not helped by the other version.
John must call from the outside of the building, judging by what
follows. An altercation seems to pass between Robin and some one;
we should suppose between Robin and Red Roger. Robin slips out of
a shot-window, and as he does so is thrust through the side by
Red Roger. Robin swoops off Red Roger's head, and leaves him for
dogs to eat. Then Red Roger must be below, and John is certainly
below. He would have seen to Red Roger had they both been within.
But John must be under a window on a different side of the
building from that whence Robin issues, for otherwise, again, he
would have seen to Red Roger. We are driven to suppose that the
words in st. 19 pass between Robin above and Roger below.</p>

<p>Though Robin is near his last breath, he has, he says, life
enough to take his housel. He must get it in a very irregular
way, but he trusts it will "bestand" him.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d120_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> John asks his
master's leave to set fire to Kirklees, but Robin will not incur
God's blame by harming any woman ["widow"] at his latter end. Let
John make his grave of gravel and greet, set his sword at his
head, his arrows at his feet, and lay his bow by his
side.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d120_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>B</b>, though found only in late 'garlands, is in the fine
old strain. Robin Hood says to Little John that he can no longer
shoot matches, his arrows will not flee; he must go to a cousin
to be let blood. He goes, alone, to Kirkley nunnery, and is
received with a show of cordiality. His cousin bloods him, locks
him up in the room, and lets him bleed all the livelong day, and
until the next day at noon. Robin bethinks himself of escaping
through a casement, but is not strong enough. He sets his horn to
his mouth and blows thrice, but so wearily that Little John,
hearing, thinks his master must be nigh to death. John comes to
Kirkley, breaks the locks, and makes his way to Robin's presence.
He begs the boon of setting fire to Kirkley, but Robin has never
hurt woman in all his life, and will not at his end. He asks for
his bow to shoot his last shot, and where the arrow lights there
his grave shall be.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d120_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> His grave is to be of gravel and green,
long enough and broad enough, a sod under his head, another at
his feet, and his bow by his side, that men may say, Here lies
bold Robin Hood.</p>

<p>The account of Robin Hood's death which is given in The Gest,
agrees as to the main items with what we find in <b>A</b>. The
prioress of Kirkesly, his near kinswoman, betrayed him when he
went to the nunnery to be let blood, and this she did upon
counsel with Sir Roger of Donkester, with whom she was intimate.
The Life of Robin Hood in the Sloane Manuscript, which is mostly
made up from The Gest, naturally repeats this story.</p>

<p>Grafton, in his Chronicle, 1569, citing "an olde and auncient
pamphlet," says: For the sayd Robert Hood, beyng afterwardes
troubled with sicknesse, came to a certain nonry in Yorkshire,
called Bircklies, where, desiryng to be let blood, he was
betrayed and bled to death: edition of 1809, p. 221. So the
Harleian Manuscript, No 1233, article 199, of the middle of the
seventeenth century, and not worth citing, but cited by Ritson.
According to Stanihurst, in Holinshed's Ireland (p. 28 of ed. of
1808), after Robin Hood had been betrayed at a nunnery in
Scotland called Bricklies, Little John was fain to flee the
realm, and went to Ireland, where he executed an extraordinary
shot, by which he thought his safety compromised, and so removed
to Scotland, and died there.</p>

<p>Martin Parker's True Tale of Robin Hood, which professes to be
collected from chronicles, ascribes Robin Hood's death to a
faithless friar, who pretended "in love to let him blood," when
he had a fever, and allowed him to bleed to death. Robin Hood and
the Valiant Knight, a late and thoroughly worthless broadside
ballad, says simply, He sent for a monk to let him blood, who
took his life away.</p>

<p>A Russian popular song has an interesting likeness to the
conclusion of Robin Hood's Death. The last survivor of a band of
brigands, feeling death to be nigh, exclaims:</p>

tomb wide and high enough for him to fight in it, standing up,
and to leave a window, so that the swallows may tell him that
spring has come and the nightingales that it is May: Fauriel, I,
