</ol>

<p>'Allison Gross' was printed by Jamieson, Popular Ballads, II,
187, without deviation from the manuscript save in spelling.</p>

<p>In a Greek tale, a nereid, that is elf or fairy, turns a youth
who had refused to espouse her into a snake, the curse to continue
till he finds another love who is as fair as she: 'Die
Sch&ouml;nste,' B. Schmidt, Griechische M&auml;rchen, etc., No
10. This tale is a variety of 'Beauty and the Beast,' one of the
numerous wild
<a name="Page_I_314"/>
growths from that ever charming French
story.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d035_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>An elf, a hill-troll, a mermaid, make a young man offers of
splendid gifts, to obtain his love or the promise of his faith,
in 'Elveskud,' Grundtvig, No 47, many of the Danish and two of
the Norwegian copies; 'Hertig Magnus och Elfvorna,' Afzelius.
III, 172; 'Hr. Magnus og Bj&aelig;rgtrolden,' Grundtvig, No 48,
Arwidsson, No 147 B; 'Herr Magnus och Hafstrollet,' Afzelius, No
95, Bugge. No 11; a lind-worm. similarly, to a young woman,
'Lindormen,' Grundtvig, No 65. Magnus answers the hill-troll that
he should be glad to plight faith with her were she like other
women. but she is the ugliest troll that could be found:
Grundtvig, II, 121, <b>A</b> 6, <b>B</b> 7; Arwidsson, II, 303,
<b>B</b> 5; Afzelius, III, 168, st. 5, 173, st. 6. This is like
what we read in stanza 7 of our ballad, but the answer is
inevitable in any such case. Magnus comes off scot-free.</p>

<p>The queen of the fairies undoing the spell of the witch is a
remarkable feature, not paralleled, so far as I know, in English
or northern tradition. The Greek nereids, however, who do pretty
much everything, good or bad, that is ascribed to northern elves
or fairies, and even bear an appellation resembling that by which
fairies are spoken of in Scotland and Ireland, "the good
damsels," "the good ladies," have a queen who is described as
taking no part in the unfriendly acts of her subjects, but as
being kindly disposed towards mankind, and even as repairing the
mischief which subordinate sprites have done against her will. If
now the fairy queen might interpose in behalf of men against her
own kith and kin, much more likely would she be to exert herself
to thwart the malignity of a witch.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d035_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The object of the witch's blowing thrice on a grass-green horn
in 8<sup>2</sup> is not clear, for nothing comes of it. In the
closely related ballad which follows this, a witch uses a horn to
summon the sea-fishes, among whom there is one who has been the
victim of her spells. The horn is appropriate. Witches were
supposed to blow horns when they joined the wild hunt, and
horn-blower, "hornbl&acirc;se," is twice cited by Grimm as an
equivalent to witch: Deutsche Mythologie, p. 886.</p>
