<h3>22. St Stephen and Herod</h3>

<p>P. 234. The F&auml;r&ouml;e 'Rudisar v&iacute;sa' is No 11 of
Hammershaimb's F&aelig;r&oslash;sk Anthologi, p. 89. Three copies
are now known.</p>

<p>238 b. A description of San Domingo de la Calzada, with a
narration of the miracle of St. James, is cited by Birlinger from
a manuscript of travels by a young German, 1587-93, in Alemannia,
XIII, 42-44. The traveller had heard "the fable" in Italy, too,
and had seen a painting of it at Savona. R. K&ouml;hler.</p>

<p>De Gubernatis, Zo&ouml;logical Mythology, II, 283 f, note 2,
after citing the legend of San Domingo de la Calzada, adds: A
similar wonder is said, by Sigonio, to have taken place in the
eleventh century in the Bolognese; but instead of St. James,
Christ and St. Peter appear to perform miracles. G.L.K.</p>

<p>239. In The Ely Volume, or, The Contributions of our Foreign
Missions to Science, etc., 2d ed., Boston, 1885, the editor, Dr.
Laurie, discoursing of the Yezidees, says they speak of Satan an
Melek Taoos, King Peacock, and the cawals (a sort of
circuit-riders), "carry round with them brazen images of a bird
on a sort of Oriental candlestick, as vouchers for their mission,
and a means of blessing to their followers. One of them gave Dr.
Lobdell the following account of the origin of this name [Melek
Taoos]. In the absence of his disciples, Satan, in the form of a
dervish, took Christ down from the cross and carried him to
heaven. Soon after the Marys came and asked the dervish where
Christ was. They would not believe his reply, but promised to do
so if he would restore the chicken he was eating to life. He did
so, and when he told them who he was they adored him. When he
left them he promised always to appear to them as a beautiful
bird, and so the peacock became his symbol." P. 315. G.L.K.</p>
