<p>Had an old copy of this still pretty and touching, but much
disordered, ballad been saved, we should perhaps have had a story
like this. Bonnie Annie, having stolen her father's gold and her
mother's fee, and fled with her paramour (like the maid in No 4),
the ship in which she is sailing encounters a storm and cannot
get on. Annie is seized with the pangs of travail, and deplores
the absence of women (<b>B</b> 6, 7, <b>A</b> 9, 10; compare No
15, 21-26). The sailors say there is somebody on board who is
marked for death, or flying from a just doom. They cast lots, and
the lot falls on Annie, &mdash; a result which strikes us as having more
semblance of the "corrupted currents of this world" than of a
pure judgment of God. Annie, conscious only of her own guilt,
asks to be thrown overboard. Her
<a name="Page_I_245"/>
paramour offers great sums to
the crew to save her, but their efforts prove useless, and Annie
again begs, or they now insist, that she shall be cast into the
sea with her babe. This done, the ship is able to sail on; Annie
floats to shore and is buried there.</p>

<p>The captain of the ship is the guilty man in <b>A</b>, in
<b>B</b> a rich squire. A may exhibit the original plot, but it
is just as likely that the captain was substituted for a
passenger, under the influence of another ballad, in which there
is no Annie, but a ship-master stained with many crimes, whom the
lot points out as endangering or obstructing the vessel. See
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_57.html">Brown Robyn's Confession</a>,' further on.</p>

<p>If the narrative in Jonah, i, is the ultimate source of this
and similar stories, it must be owned that the tradition has
maintained its principal traits in this ballad remarkably well.
Jonah flies from the presence of the Lord in a ship; the ship is
overtaken by a tempest;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d024_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> the sailors cast lots to know who is
the guilty cause, and the lot falls on Jonah; he bids the sailors
take him up and cast him into the sea; nevertheless the men row
hard to bring the ship to land, but cannot succeed; they throw
Jonah into the water, and the storm ceases.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d024_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
