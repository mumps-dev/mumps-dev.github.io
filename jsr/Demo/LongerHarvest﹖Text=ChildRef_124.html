<p>Printed in Ritson's Robin Hood, 1795, II, 16, from one of
Wood's copies, "compared with two other copies in the British
Museum, one in black letter:" Evans, Old Ballads, 1777, 1784, 1,
99.</p>

<p>There is another copy in the Roxburghe collection, III, 24,
and there are two in the Bagford.</p>

<p>'A ballett of Wakefylde and a grene' is entered to Master John
Wallye and Mistress Toye, 19 July, 1557-9 July, 1558: Stationers'
Registers, Arber, I, 76.</p>

<p>The ballad is one of four, besides the Gest, that were known
to the author of the Life of Robin Hood in Sloane Manuscript 780,
which dates from early in the seventeenth century. It is
thoroughly lyrical, and therein "like the old age," and was
pretty well sung to pieces before it ever was printed. A snatch
of it is sung, as Ritson has observed, in each of the Robin Hood
plays, The Downfall of Robert, Earl of Huntington, by Anthony
Munday, and The Death of Robert, Earl of Huntington, by A. Munday
and Henry Chettle, both printed in 1601.</p>

<p>Silence sings the line 'And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John,'
3<sup>2</sup>, in the Second Part of King Henry Fourth, V, 3, and
Falstaff addresses Bardolph as Scarlet and John in the first
scene of The Merry Wives of Windsor. In Beaumont and Fletcher's
Philaster, V, 4, Dyce, I, 295, we have: "Let not ... your
Robinhoods, Scarlets, and Johns tie your affections in darkness
to your shops." Scarlet and John, comrades of Robin Hood from the
beginning, are prominent in many ballads.</p>

<p>Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John have left the highway and made a
path over the corn,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d124_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> apparently in defiance of the Pinder of
Wakefield, who has the fame of being able to exact a penalty of
trespassers, whatever their rank. The Pinder bids them turn
again; they, being three to one, scorn to comply. The Pinder
fights with them till their swords are broken. Robin cries Hold!
and asks the Pinder to join his company in the greenwood. This
the Pinder is ready to do at Michaelmas, when his engagement to
his present master will be terminated. Robin asks for meat and
drink, and the Pinder offers him bread, beef, and ale.</p>

<p>The adventure of the ballad is naturally introduced into the
play of George a Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield, printed in
1599, reprinted in Dodsley's Old Plays (the third volume of the
edition of 1825), and by Dyce among the works of Robert Greene.
George a Greene fights with Scarlet, and beats him; then with
Much (not John), and beats him; then with Robin Hood. Robin
protests he is the stoutest champion that ever he laid hands on,
and says:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>George, wilt thou forsake Wakefield<br/>
And go with me?<br/>
Two liveries will I give thee every year,<br/>
And forty crowns shall be thy fee.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>George welcomes Robin to his house, offering him wafer-cakes,
beef, mutton, and veal. (Dyce, II, 196 f.)</p>

<p>The scene in the play is found in the prose history of George
a Green, London, 1706, of which a copy is known, no doubt
substantially the same, of the date 1632. The Pinner here fells
'Slathbatch,' Little John, and the Friar, before his bout with
Robin. See Thorns, A Collection of Early Prose Romances, II,
44-47, and the prefaces, p. viii ff, p. xviii f, for more about
the popularity of the Pinner's story.</p>

<p>Wakefield is in the West Riding of the county of York.</p>

<p>Richard Brathwayte, in a poetical epistle "to all true-bred
northerne sparks of the generous society of the Cottoneers,"
Strappado for the Divell, 1615 (cited by Ritson, Robin Hood, ed.
1795, I, xxvii-ix), speaks of</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>The Pindar's valour, and how firme he stood<br/>
In th' townes defence gainst th' rebel Robin Hood;<br/>
How stoutly he behav'd himselfe, and would,<br/>
In spite of Robin, bring his horse to th' fold:</td></tr>

</table>

<p>from which we might infer that according to one account the
Pinder had impounded Robin's horse. But as Robin Hood, in this
passage, is confounded with the rebel Earl of Kendal, or some one
of his adherents, it is safe to suppose that Brathwayte has been
twice inaccurate.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d124_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The ballad is so imperfect that one might be in doubt whether
the Pinder fights with Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John all together
or successively. But to suppose the Pinder capable of dealing
with all three at once would be monstrous, and we see from the
History and from Greene's play that the Pinder must take them one
after the other, and Robin the last of the three.</p>

<p>There are seven other ballads, besides The Pinder of
Wakefield, in which Robin Hood, after trying his strength with a
stout fellow, and coming off somewhat or very much the worse,
induces his antagonist to enlist in his company. Several of these
are very late, and most of them imitations, we may say, of the
Pinder, or one of the other. These ballads are: Robin Hood and
the Curtal Friar; Robin Hood and Little John; Robin Hood and the
Tanner; Robin Hood and the Tinker, 28 ff; Robin Hood Revived;
Robin Hood and the Ranger; Robin Hood and the Scotchman. We might
add Robin Hood and Maid Marian. The episode of Little John and
the Cook, in the Gest, 165-171, is after the same pattern. There
is another set in which a contest of a like description does not
result in an accession to the outlaw-band. These are Robin Hood
and the Potter; Robin Hood and the Butcher; Robin Hood and the
Beggar, I; Robin Hood and the Beggar, II (Robin Hood first
beaten, then three of his men severely handled); Robin Hood and
the Shepherd (Robin Hood overmastered, Little John on the point
of being beaten, etc.); The Bold Pedlar and Robin Hood (John
outmatched first, then his master); Robin Hood's Delight (combat
between Robin Hood, Little John, and Scadlock and three Keepers);
Robin Hood and the Pedlars (again three to three).</p>

<p>There are, as might be expected, frequent verbal agreements in
these ballads, and many of them are collected by Fricke, Die
RobinHood-Balladen, pp 91-95.</p>

<p>The fights in these ballads last from an hour, Gest, st. 168,
to a long summer's day, in this ballad, st. 6. In Robin Hood and
Maid Marian, st. 11, the time is at least an hour, or more; in
Robin Hood and the Tanner, st. 20, two hours and more; in Robin
Hood and the Ranger, st. 12, three hours; in Robin Hood and the
Curtal Friar, <b>B</b> 24, and Robin Hood and the Shepherd, st.
11, from ten o'clock till four; in Robin Hood's Delight, st. 11,
from eight o'clock till two, and past.</p>
