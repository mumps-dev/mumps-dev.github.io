<p><b>D</b>, <b>E</b> form the conclusion of a ballad which
belongs to the series of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_173.html">Mary Hamilton</a>,' or 'The Queen's Mary,'
and give an entirely wrong turn to that distressful tragedy.</p>

<p><b>F</b> had become a children's game, the last stage of many
old ballads: see the notes. In <b>G</b> and <b>H</b> the verses
are set in a popular tale, and a characteristic explanation is
furnished of the danger which the heroine has incurred: she has
lost a golden key, or a golden ball, which had been entrusted to
her. See, again, the notes.</p>

<p>All the English versions are defective and distorted, as
comparison will show. In many others, both from northern and
southern Europe, a young woman has fallen into the hands of
corsairs; father, mother, brother, sister, refuse to pay ransom,
but her lover, in one case husband, stickles at no price which
may be necessary to retrieve her.</p>

<p>We will begin with the best ballad of the cycle, the Sicilian
'Scibilia Nobili,' communicated to Nuove Effemeridi Siciliane,
Nuova Serie, I, 528, 1874, by Salvatore Struppa, as sung by a
peasant woman in the neighbor hood of Marsala, 151 verses.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d095_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
Tunisian cor- sairs, learning of the marriage of the king's
daughter, fit out a strong force, and when they are near port
change caps, to pass for Christians. They knock at Scibilia's
door, and, on her refusing to open, her husband being a-hunting,
burst the door in, and carry her on board ship. Her husband goes
to the shore weeping, and offers her captors her weight in gold;
they will not give her up for a shipful. He begs to be allowed a
word with her: why has she let herself be carried off, and who
will nurse her boy? She refuses to eat, drink, or sleep. The
sailors fall asleep, and Scibilia drops into the sea. They take
silk ladders to recover her; she weeps always. (It would be
superfluous to do more than point to the fact that the story is
not well compacted, or altogether rational, as we have it.) The
lady, turning to a sailor, says, Can you tell me how the wind is?
If north or south, I will go to my father. No opposition is made
by the pirates, who had but just now refused a shipful of gold
for her. "My dear father, will you ransom me?" "For how much, my
dear daughter?" "Three lions, three falcons, and four pillars of
gold." "I cannot lose so much money: how much better lose you!"
She is urged by her captors to eat and drink, but will not eat,
drink, or sleep, for her boy is starving. She again makes for the
coast, weeping ever, and the foregoing scene, from the inquiry as
to the wind, is repeated with mother, brother, sister. All say it
is better to lose her than so much money. She finally tries her
husband, who answers, Better lose all this gold; it is enough if
you are not lost. And after three days the father died. "And let
him die; I will dress all in red." And after three days the
mother died. "And let her die; I will dress all in yellow." And
after three days the brother died. "And let him die; I will dress
all in green." And after three days the sister died. "And let her
die; I will dress all in white. And if my dear husband dies, I
will dress in black."</p>

<p><b>Spanish</b>. <b>A</b>. <b>a</b>, 'La Donzella,' Die
Balearen in Wort und Bild geschildert, II, 263 (privately printed
by the Archduke Ludwig Salvator, Leipzig, 1871, a book which I
have not been able to obtain), Liebrecht, Zur Volkskunde, p. 231;
b, Briz, Cansons de la Terra, IV, 15, from a Majorcan
<i>revista</i>. <b>B</b>. 'Lo Reseat,' Briz, IV, 13. <b>C</b>.
'La Cautiva,' Mild, Romancerillo, p. 257, No 261. In <b>A</b> a
maid, who is embroidering a handkerchief by the seashore, lacking
silk, hails a vessel, and asks if they have any. She is invited
to come aboard and see if they have what she requires. She falls
asleep, and the sailors put off. This beginning is like that of
another very common ballad. The maid is wakened by the singing of
the sailors, and asks them to put into the port where her father
is. What follows corresponds to the English ballad. "Father, will
you ransom me? The Moors offer me for sale." "Dear daughter, how
much do they ask?" "I am yours for a hundred crowns." "Daughter,
I will not pay a penny for you." The scene is repeated with
mother, brother, and sister, all of whom make the same answer as
the father, and then with the lover; but his reply is, I would
not give you up for all the world.</p>

<p>The first five stanzas of <b>A</b> are wanting in <b>B</b>,
which begins, accordingly, at the point where the maid asks to
have the ship put about. The sister is omitted in <b>B</b>, as
also in <b>A</b> <b>b</b>. <b>C</b> is shortened still further,
beginning with the appeal to the father, and omitting both sister
and brother.</p>

<p>F&auml;r&ouml;e. 'Fr&iacute;sa V&iacute;sa,' communicated by
Hammershaimb, with other ballads, to the Antiquarisk Tidsskrift,
1849-51, p. 95. Frisian pirates are carrying away a maid. She
weeps and beats her hands, and cries, Wait, my father will ransom
me; he will ransom me with his castles; he will not let me perish
in Friesland. The father answers, I have only two castles;
neither of them can I give up for thee; indeed thou mayst perish
in Friesland. The Frisians are starting off again. The maid begs
them to stop; her mother will redeem her with her kirtles. But
the mother says, I have but two kirtles, and neither of them can
I give up for thee; indeed thou mayst perish in Friesland. Once
more the Frisians are about to put off. The maid says her lover
will redeem her with his ships. The lover loyally responds, I
have only two ships; both will I gladly part with for thee; thou
shalt not perish in Friesland. It appears from a note of
Hammershaimb that the ballad might be extended indefinitely by
the maid's calling upon brother, sister, and friends to redeem
her with their respective valuables.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d095_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>Icelandic</b>. A ballad briefly mentioned at p. 20 f of the
volume of the Antiquarisk Tids skrift, before cited. The Frisians
call out, Bear the Danish maid to the ships! 'Bide, Frisians,
bide; my kinsfolk will redeem me.' Upon the sixth appeal, to her
lover, the maid is ransomed.</p>

<p><b>Swedish</b>. 'Den Borts&aring;lda,' the same ballad as the
F&auml;r&ouml;e and the Icelandic, with an absurd introductory
stanza, in which the maid is said to have been sold into the
heathen land by her parents fora bit of bread; whence the title.
<b>A</b>. <b>a</b>, Afzelius, No 15, I, 73; <a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d095_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> b, Hofberg,
Nerikes Gamla Minnen, p. 256, No 5. <b>B</b>. Afzelius, I, 134.
<b>C</b>. Rancken, Nagra prof af folks&aring;ng, p. 6, No 2, with
collation of three other copies. <b>D</b>. Eva Wigstrom,
Folkdiktning, I, 62, No 29. <b>E</b>. Oberg, in Aminson, Bidrag,
I, 23. <b>F</b>. Axelson, Vesterdalarne, p. 174, No 2, three
stanzas, the rest said to be "entirely like" the Afzelius copies,
which differ considerably. A maid is in the hands of sea-rovers,
and they are on the point of rowing off with her. She wrings her
hands, and calls to them to wait a while. She sees her father
coming, who will redeem her with his oxen, and so she shall
escape going to the heathen land to pine away. The father says he
has but oxen two: the one he shall be using, the other he shall
keep lata sta; and she will not scape going to the heathen land.
The sailors lower their oars. The maid wrings her hands, and
calls to them again to wait; she sees her mother coming, who will
redeem her with her gold caskets. The mother says she has of gold
caskets but two: the one she shall be using, the other shall let
stay. The maid sees her sister, who will redeem her with her gold
crowns. The sister has but two gold crowns, one of which she
shall be using, the other will let be. The maid sees her brother,
who will redeem her with his foals. The brother has but two
foals: the one he shall be using, the other he will let be, and
she will not scape from going to the heathen land to pine away.
Then the maid sees her true-love coming, and calls to him to
redeem her with his gold rings. "Of gold rings," he says, "I have
no more than twelve: with six I shall redeem thee, six thou shalt
have thyself; so thou scapest going to the heathen land to pine
away."</p>

<p>This is the story in <b>A</b>, and the chief variations of the
other copies are in the things which the maid proposes to her
kindred and her lover to redeem her with, and the number of these
which they profess to have. The spuriousness of the introductory
stanza, in which the girl is said to have been sold into the
heathen land for dire need, is evident. The family have two oxen,
two gold caskets, two gold crowns, two foals; or even houses,
gold caskets, gold chains, mills, more than five, <b>B</b>, and
no doubt everything handsome about them. In <b>D</b> the father
is even a king. <b>B</b>, <b>F</b> lack this beginning. <b>C</b>
concludes with a permissible imprecation on the part of the
lover:</p>

<p>'Cursed be thy father, cursed be thy mother,<br/>
Cursed be thy sister, and even so thy brother!'</p>

<p>In Danish the ballad occurs in manuscripts, and has been
printed as a broadside: Bergstr&ouml;m's Afzelius, II, 63.</p>

<p><b>German</b>. <b>A</b>. Grater's Idunna und Hermode, 1814, p.

No 164, Kind's Erz&auml;hlungen, 1822, p. 77," Auserwahlte
Unterhaltungen, Wien, 1827, I, 20. 'Die Losgekaufte,' in
Kretzschmer, I, 181, is rewritten; 'Loskauf,' in Simrock, No 39,
p. 90, is made up from a variety of copies. Several of the
versions come very near to one another, especially
<b>C</b>-<b>F</b>, nor is there any noteworthy difference in the
story of the whole series, save a single point in the last three.
A maid whom seamen are carrying off begs them to stop or put back
to land; she has a father who will not abandon her. She begs her
father to part with coat, house, hat, watch, or bull, to save her
from drowning; the father refuses. Then, as before, she
successively and vainly entreats her mother to redeem her with
gold chain, ring, apron, gown, or silver trinkets; her brother
with silver buckles, hat, horse, sword, or coat; her sister with
apron, dress, shoes, green wreath, or pearl wreath. Two of the
four relatives are wanting in <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>. All
of her blood refusing to ransom the maid, she calls upon her
lover to sacrifice sword, horse, ring, golden hill, to save her,
or, in <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, to sell himself to the oar,
and the lover is ready in every case. The redemption is not from
slavery in a foreign land, but from drowning.</p>

<p><b>Esthonian</b>. The ballad is known all over Esthonia, and a
copy composed of two closely resembling versions is given by
Neus, Ehstnische Volkslieder, p. 109, 'Die Ausgeloste.' A girl,
taken captive in war, asks that the boats may put in, in order
that she may find some one to buy her off. She appeals first to
her mother, who might redeem her with the best of three aprons
which she possesses, one of which is of gold web, another of
silver, an other of brass. A daughter, answers the mother, is a
thing of to-day and to-morrow; my aprons are for life. Her father
is next asked to ransom her with the best of three bulls which he
owns, which have a horn of gold, silver, and brass respectively.
His daughter is his for two days, his bulls for life. The brother
is entreated to save her by the sacrifice of the best of his
three horses, which have severally manes of gold, silver, and
brass. His sister is his for two days, his horse for life. The
sister is asked to part with the best of her three wreaths, which
are of gold, silver, brass, for an only sister's sake. A sister
is hers for a month or two, her wreath, for life. Finally the
maid turns to her true- love, who has three hats, one of brass,
one of silver, one of gold, and entreats him to devote the best
to her redemption. How long lasts a hat? he exclaims. A couple of
days; but my betrothed for life! Another copy of the same ballad
is given by Neus in Dorpater Jahrb&uuml;cher, V, 228.</p>

<p>The ballad is equally popular in Finland: 'Lunastettava
neiti,' Kanteletar, 1864, p. 283, No 26, p. 285, No 27, ed. 1840,
III, 181, 137, 273 f; Rancken, Nagra prof, p. 9.</p>

<p>In various Slavic ballads the man and maid change parts, and
the man is ransomed by the generosity of his mistress when his
kinsfolk have failed him.</p>

<p>Two "Wendish ballads, Haupt and Schma- ler, <b>A</b>, No 74,
<b>B</b>, No 75, I, 107 ff, begin, like the popular German ballad
'Der Sch&auml;fer und der Edelmann,' with a shepherd's being
thrown into prison by a nobleman for wearing a costume beyond his
rank, and proud words be sides. He sees his father coming,
<b>A</b>, and asks him to pawn half a hundred sheep and get him
out. The father prefers his half hundred sheep. He sees his
mother coming, and asks her to pawn two cows and release him. She
prefers her cows. He sees his brother coming, and asks him to
pawn his horse. His brother prefers his horse. He sees his sister
coming, and asks her to pawn a fine gown, but the gown again is
much dearer in his sister's eyes. He sees his love coming, and
asks her to pawn her coral necklace for his ransom, which she
does, and he is released. In B he writes to father, mother, and
sister to ransom him; they all tell him that if he were good for
anything he would not be in prison. His love flies to him and
ransoms him.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d095_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>Russian</b>. &#268;elakowsk&yacute;, II, 106,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d095_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
Sakharof, IV, 171, No 13. A young man in prison writes to father
and mother for ransom; the whole family will have nothing to do
with malefactors and robbers. His love, when written to, calls to
her women to get her gold to gether, all that shall be needed to
free him.</p>

<p><b>Little-Russian</b>. Golovatsky, I, 48, No 8. An imprisoned
youth writes to his father, Wilt thou ransom me, or shall I
perish? How much must he give? Forty saddled horses. Better he
should perish. He writes to his mother; she must give forty oxen
with their yokes. She declines. He writes to his love; she must
furnish forty geese with their goslings. I will spin, she says,
spin lustily, buy geese, and ransom thee. No 7, I, 46, is to the
same effect, but lacks the close.</p>

<p><b>Slovenian</b>. 'Rodbina,' 'Kinship,' Vraz, Narodne
P&#283;sni ilirske, p. 141.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d095_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A hero in prison asks his father
to release him; the three horses he must give are too much. He
asks his mother; the three castles she must give are too much. He
asks his brother; the three rifles he must give are too much. He
asks his sister; the three fair tresses she must sacrifice are
too much. He asks his love; she must give her white hand. Not too
much is my white hand, she says; easy to give for thee hand and
life besides.</p>

<p>A Little-Russian ballad in Waclaw z Oleska, p. 226, and a
Polish in Waldbr&uuml;hl's Balalaika, p. 504, have the same
theme, Love stronger than Blood (woman's love here), but do not
belong with the pieces already cited as to form.</p>
