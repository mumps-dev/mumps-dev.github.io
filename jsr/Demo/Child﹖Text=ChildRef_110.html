<p>The only English version of this ballad is a broadside, found
in the Roxburghe Collection.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d110_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It was given from a
black-letter copy, with changes and the omission of stanza 4, in
the Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, 1765, III, 75. Hearne, in
his preface to Guilielmi Neubrigensis Historia, I, lxx (cited by
Percy), remarks that some impressions were adorned with the
picture of a queen, meant, as he maintains, to be Elizabeth, and
quotes the first stanza,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d110_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> From this Percy infers that the
ballad was popular in Elizabeth's time, a supposition probable
enough in itself, and confirmed by the fifteenth stanza occurring
(as Percy notes) in Fletcher's comedy of 'The Pilgrim,'
1621.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d110_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Motherwell, Minstrelsy, Introduction, p. lxvi, says that the
ballad was current in Scot land in many shapes (1827).</p>

<p>The copy in Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads, p. 13, is
<b>C</b>, with the stanzas given here as <b>D</b> incorporated
into it from another version.</p>

<p>Kinloch is fully justified in claiming for the Scottish ballad
a decided superiority. The humorous artifices which the lady
practises to maintain the character of a beggar's brat are, as he
says, kept up with great spirit and fancy, and, as far as we
know, are entirely of Scottish invention. It might perhaps be
objected that in the course of tradition they have been
exaggerated in later copies to a point threaten ing weariness.</p>

<p>The passage in which the knight rides off and is followed so
closely by the maid, through river and all, <b>A</b> 6-8,
<b>B</b> 510, etc., is found also in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_63.html">Child Waters</a>,' <b>A</b>
11-16, <b>B</b> 4-11, etc., and suits both ballads perhaps
equally well.</p>

<p>Parts of this ballad inevitably suggest a parallel with the
tales belonging to the class of the 'Marriage of Sir
Gawain.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d110_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In the Wife of Bath's Tale, a lusty bachelor who
has been out hawking meets a maid walking, and forces her to
yield to his will. The offence is brought before King
Arthur,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d110_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and the knight, as he is also called, is condemned
to death. The alternative of marrying is so distasteful to him
that he tries every means to avoid it. 'Take all my good,' he
says to the woman, 'but let my body go.' But all for naught. Dame
Ragnell makes a point of being wedded in high style; so does our
shepherd's daughter in <b>E</b> 37, 38, <b>F</b> 38, 39. In
Gower, the knight takes the woman on his horse and rides away
sighing; and they also have a cauld and eerie ride in <b>B</b>
39. The bride becomes, if possible, more and more repulsive in
the Gawain tales, and endeavors to make herself so in the ballad.
As in the tales, so in the ballad, the bridegroom will not turn
about and make much of her, <b>C</b> 29, <b>E</b> 56, <b>G</b>
30. The ugly woman turns out to be a king's daughter in Gower's
tale, a most desirable wife in all the others; and the
shepherdess is a king's daughter in <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>K</b>, and at least an excellent match in other copies. The
knight is nephew to a king or emperor in three of the tales, and
the queen's brother or the king's in nearly all the ballads.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d110_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
Even the Billy Blin in <b>F</b> 60-63, <b>G</b> 31, 32, cf.
<b>D</b> 15, 16, looks like a remnant of the fairy machinery of
the Gawain tales.</p>

<p>The tragic ballad of 'Ebbe Gait,' Danske Viser, II, 47, No 63,
has several features in common with 'The Knight and Shepherd's
Daughter.' Ebbe Gait has been drinking heavily with the king's
men. Riding home through a wood, he meets in an evil hour a
farmer's pretty wife, and offers her presents to show him the way
to the town. She under takes to do so, though much afraid. They
come to the farmer's house. Ebbe Gait begins to ban and beat, and
in the end ravishes the woman, using extreme cruelty. She says,
Now you have had your will of me, with little good to either of
us, for God's sake tell me your name. He declares himself to be
Ebbe Gait. The farmer comes home and is told all. He comforts his
wife and goes to make his plaint to the king. If any man in the
court has done this, says the king, it shall cost him his life.
When he learns that the man is his nephew, he would rather than
half Denmark not have pronounced so harsh a doom. Ebbe Gait is
summoned to answer for himself. He is not much better sober than
drunk, though the ballad lays the fault on ale. He tells the
farmer to produce his wife; she will make no complaint. The woman
gives her evidence. She had treated Ebbe Gait with all
hospitality as her husband's guest. He had broken in the doors of
the room where she was with her children, beaten five maids and
killed three swains. Ebbe's father offers his horse and a
thousand mark as ransom. The king says that he him self, if it
lay in him, would have redeemed the youth with three thousand;
Ebbe Gait shall die. While they are taking him off, Ebbe is
flippant: he would not mind losing his life had the woman been
prettier.</p>

<p>There is a very favorite Scandinavian ballad, see
'Tarningspillet,' Grundtvig, IV, 402, No 238, in which a fair
lady challenges a young horse-boy, or boatswain, to play tables
with her, and after having won from him all he has, stakes
herself against his shoes or the like. The youth now wins; she
makes him handsome offers, rising constantly in value, to let her
off, but he will not. God pity me! she says; but he reveals to
her that her case is not a bad one, for he is the best king's son
in the world.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d110_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>An imitation of the English ballad by Laplace, 'Lise et
Mainfroi,' 1740, terminates more sentimentally. The shepherdess
persists that she will have the hand which the king has awarded
her, until she stands before the altar. She then declares that
her sense of honor has been satisfied, and resigns a very
advantageous match (for she is not a princess in disguise), with
"Puisses-tu du moins quelquefois te souvenir de ta
berg&egrave;re!" Mainfroi exclaims in a transport, Stay, deign to
be my wife! the king and all the court unite in the entreaty, and
Lise yields. She certainly is entitled to a statuette in
porcelain. See Charles Malo, Les Chansons d'Autrefois, pp.
124-128.</p>
