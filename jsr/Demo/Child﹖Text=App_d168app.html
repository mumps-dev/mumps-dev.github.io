<p>A text made from <b>b</b> and <b>c</b> is printed by Weber,
Flodden Field, p. 366, and by R.H. Evans, Old Ballads, 1810, III,
58. <b>b</b>, <b>c</b> lack all that follows 102 except 103, with
which all three copies alike end. This stanza makes a natural
conclusion to the vindication of Lancashire, Cheshire and the
Earl of Derby, and what intervenes in <b>a</b>, after 102, seems
to be an interpolation. Nevertheless I have preferred to give the
Percy text (though the others are not inferior to it, and possess
the unity which has to be brought about in this case by
transferring the last stanza), on account of the pleasing story
How Rowland Egerton came to the lordship of Ridley, 107119, which
would make no bad ballad by itself.</p>

<p>At the battle of Flodden, the right wing of the van, commanded
by Sir Edmund Howard, the third son of the Earl of Surrey, was
routed by the Scots under Lord Home, Chamberlain of Scotland, and
the Earl of Huntly. "Edmund Howard had with him a thousand
Cheshire men, and five hundred Lancashire men, and many gentlemen
of Yorkshire, on the right wing of the lord Howard; and the Lord
Chamberlain of Scotland, with many lords, did set on him, and the
Cheshire and Lancashire men never abode stroke, and few of the
gentlemen of Yorkshire abode, but fled... And the said Edmund
Howard was thrice felled, and to his relief the lord Dacre came,
with fifteen hundred men."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d168app_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> On the other hand, the Cheshire
and Lancashire men of the extreme left, under command of Sir
Edward Stanley, discomfited the Scottish division of Lennox and
Argyle. King Henry received the news of the victory while he was
lying before Tournay, "and highly praised the Earl, and the Lord
Admiral and his son, and all the gentlemen and commons that were
at that valiant enterprise; howbeit, the king had a secret letter
that the Cheshire men fled from Sir Edmund Howard, which letter
caused great heart-burning and many words; but the king
thankfully accepted all thing, and would no man to be
dispraised."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d168app_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>This poem, a history in the ballad style, was composed to
vindicate the behavior of Lancashire and Cheshire at Flodden, and
to glorify the Stanleys;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d168app_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in the accomplishment of which
objects it becomes incumbent upon the minstrel to expose the
malice of the Earl of Surrey, to whom he imputes the "wrong
writing" which caused such heart-burning.</p>

<p>The Earl of Surrey sends a letter by a herald to King Henry,
then at Tournay. The king asks the news before he breaks the
seal, and who fought and who fled. The herald answers that King
James is slain, and that Lancashire and Cheshire fled; no man of
the Earl of Derby's durst face thie foe. The king opens the
letter, which confirms the herald's report, and calls for the
Earl of Derby. Sir Ralph Egerton suggests that if Lancashire and
Cheshire fled, it must have been because they had a Howard, and
not a Stanley, for their captain. The Earl of Derby comes before
the king, and says the same; let him have Lancashire and
Cheshire, and he will burn up all Scotland and conquer to Paris
gate. The king says cowards will fight to retrieve what they have
lost. We were never cowards, rejoins Derby; who brought in your
father at Milford Haven? (It was not precisely the Stanleys.) The
king turns away; the Duke of Buckingham is ready to lay his life
that all this comes from a false writing of the Earl of
Surrey.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d168app_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Derby is not to be comforted, and breaks out in
farewells to all his kith and kin, Edward Stanley, John Stanley,
and many more; they must be slain, for they never would flee. The
Earl of Shrewsbury bids him take heart; Derby goes on with
farewells to Lancaster, Latham, and all familiar places. In the
midst of his exclamations, James Garsed, "Long Jamie," a yeoman
of the guard, comes flying to the Earl of Derby for protection:
he had killed two men, and wounded three. Derby's intercession
can do only harm now, but he will ask friends to speak for Jamie.
A messenger arrives from the king ordering Long Jamie to be
delivered up; he is to be hanged. Buckingham takes Jamie by one
arm and Shrewsbury takes him by the other, and with Derby in
front and many gentlemen following, they go to the king. Welcome,
dukes and earls, says the king, but most welcome of all our
traitor, Long Jamie! Jamie, how durst thou show thyself in our
presence after slaying thy brethren? Jamie explains that his
fellows had called him coward, and bidden him flee to that coward
the Earl of Derby. The Earl of Derby had befriended him when he
was little and maintained him till he was able to shoot. Then one
day a Scottish minstrel brought King Henry a bow which none of
his guard could bend. Jamie shot seven times with it, and the
eighth time broke it; then told the Scot to pick up the pieces
and take them to his king; upon which Henry had made him yeoman
of the guard, thanks to His Grace and to the Earl of Derby who
had brought him up. And now, to have the earl taunted, to be
false to the man who had been true to him he had rather die.
Stand up, Jamie, says the King; have here my charter; but let
there be no more fighting while you are in France. Then you must
grant me one thing, says Jamie that he that abuses Lancashire or
Cheshire shall die; and the king commands proclamation to be made
that any man abusing Lancashire or Cheshire shall have his
judgment on the next tree. The next morning comes a messenger
from the queen wishing the king joy, for his brother-in-law, King
Jamie, is slain. Henry asks again, Who fought and who fled?
"Lancashire and Cheshire have done the deed," is the reply; "had
not the Earl of Derby been true to thee, England had been in
great hazard." The king on the moment promotes Edward and John
Stanley and 'Rowland' Egerton, who had fought with Edward.
Buckingham runs for Derby, and the king welcomes the earl, and
returns to him all that he had taken from him. But one thing
grieveth me still, says Derby to have been called coward
yesterday. "It was a wrong writing that came from the Earl of
Surrey," says the king, "but I shall teach him to know his
prince." Derby asks no more than to be judge over Surrey, and the
king makes him so; as he says, so it shall be. "Then his life is
saved," says the earl; "if my uncle slew his father " (but, as
before said, there was no occasion for uneasiness on that score),
"he would have taken vengeance on me." And so the glory is all
shifted to Derby, and nothing remains for Surrey.</p>

<p>The minstrel goes on to speak of the surrender of Tournay, and
then of an essay of the king's to reward an Egerton for good
service done.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d168app_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Egerton would be glad to have his reward in
Cheshire. The king has nothing there to give but five mills at
Chester; Egerton does not wish to be called a miller. The king
offers the forest of Snowdon; Egerton, always kneeling on his
knee, does not wish to be called a ranger. Nothing will please
thee, Egerton, says the king; but Egerton asks for Ridley in
Cheshire, and gets it.</p>

<p>The last twelve verses profess to enumerate Henry Eighth's
victories in France: 'Hans and Gynye' (neither of which I
recognize, unless Gynye stands for Guinegatte, the Battle of the
Spurs), Tournay and The"rouanne, these in the campaign of 1513,
and Boulogne and Montreuil<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d168app_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> during the invasion of 1544.</p>
