<h3>The Rose of England</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'The Rose of Englande,' Percy Manuscript, p. 423;
Hales and Furnivall, III, 187. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d16601.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>The title of this ballad, as Percy notes in his manuscript, is
quoted in Fletcher's Monsieur Thomas (printed in 1639), act
third, scene third, Dyce, VII, 364. The subject is the winning of
the crown of England from Richard III by Henry VII, and the
parties on both sides, though some of them are sometimes called
by their proper names, are mostly indicated by their badges or
cognizances,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d166_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> which were perfectly familiar, so that though
there is a "perpetual allegory," it is not a "dark conceit."</p>

<p>The red rose of Lancaster was rooted up by a boar, Richard,
who was generally believed to have murdered Henry VI and his son
Edward, the Prince of Wales; but the seed of the rose, the Earl
of Richmond, afterwards wore the crown. The sixth stanza gives us
to understand that the young Earl of Richmond was under the
protection of Lord Stanley at Lathom before his uncle, the Earl
of Pembroke, fled with him to Brittany, in 1471; but this does
not appear in the histories. The Earl of Richmond came back to
claim his right (in 1485), and brought with him the blue boar,
the Earl of Oxford, to encounter, with Richard, the white boar.
Richmond sends a messenger to the old eagle, Lord Stanley, his
stepfather, to announce his arrival; Stanley thanks God, and
hopes that the rose shall flourish again. The Welshmen rise in a
mass under Rice ap Thomas and shog on to Shrewsbury. Master
Mitton, bailiff of Shrewsbury, refuses at first to let Richmond
enter, but, upon receiving letters from Sir William Stanley of
Holt Castle, opens the gates. The Earl of Oxford is about to
smite off the bailiff's head; Richmond interferes, and asks
Mitton why he was kept out. The bailiff knows no king but him
that wears the crown; if Richmond shall put down Richard, he
will, when sworn, be as true to Richmond as to Richard now.
Richmond recognizes this as genuine loyalty, and will not have
the bailiff harmed. The earl moves on to Newport, and then has a
private meeting at Atherstone with Lord Stanley, who makes great
moan because the young eagle, Lord Strange, his eldest son, is a
hostage in the hands of the white boar. At the battle Oxford has
the van; Lord Stanley follows 'fast'! The Talbot-dog (Sir Gilbert
Talbot) bites sore; the unicorn (Sir John Savage) quits himself
well; then comes in the hart's head (Sir William Stanley), the
field is fought, the white boar slain, and the young eagle saved
as by fire.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d166_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>How the Earl of Richmond compassed the crown of England is
told at more length in two histories in the ballad-stanza,
'Bosworth Field' and 'Lady Bessy.' The first of these (656
verses) occurs only in the Percy Manuscript, Hales and Furnivall,
III, 235. It is on the whole a tame performance. Richmond is kept
quite subordinate to the Stanleys, kneeling to Sir William, v.
371, and "desiring" the van of Lord Stanley, who grants his
request, 449-51. The second exists in two versions: (1) Harleian
Manuscript 367, printed by Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps, Percy
Society, vol. xx, 1847, p. 43, and Palatine Anthology, 1850, p.
60; Percy Manuscript, Hales and Furnivall, III, 321 (each of
about 1100 verses); (2) Percy Society and Palatine Anthology
again, p. 1, p. 6, and previously by Thomas Hey wood, 1829 Cabout
1250 vv). In this second poem the love, ambition, and energy of
Elizabeth of York sets all the instruments at work, and the
Stanleys are not so extravagantly prominent. It is a remarkably
lively narrative, with many curious details, and in its original
form (which we cannot suppose we have) must have been nearly
contemporary. 'Bosworth Field 'borrows some verses from it.</p>

trustworthiness of the chronicle occurs in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_161.html">The Battle of Otterburn</a>,'
No 161, 35 2, and again in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_168.html">Flodden Field</a>,' No 178,
appendix, 121<sup>4</sup>.</p>
