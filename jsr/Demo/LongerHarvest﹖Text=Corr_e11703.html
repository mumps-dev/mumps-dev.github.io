<h3>117. A Gest of Robyn Hode</h3>


<p>44. 'A Robynhode,' etc.</p>

<p>In the Convocation Books of the Corporation of Wells,
Somerset, vol. ii, "under the 13th Henry 7, Nicholas Trappe being
master, there is the following curious entry, relative,
apparently, to a play of Robin Hood, exhibitions of dancing
girls, and church ales, provided for at the public expense.</p>

<p>"'Et insuper in eadem Convocatione omnes et singuli burgenses
unanimi assensu ad tune et ibidem dederunt Magistro Nicolao
Trappe potestatem generalem ad inquirendum in quorum manibus
pecuni&aelig; ecclesi&aelig; ac communitatis Welli&aelig; sunt
injuste detent&aelig;; videlicet, provenientes ante hoc tempus de
Robynhode, puellis tripudiantibus, communi cervisia
ecclesi&aelig;, et hujusmodi. Atque de bonis et pecuniis
dict&aelig; communitati qualitercunque detentis, et in
quorumcunque manibus existentibus. Et desuper, eorum nomina
scribere qui habent hujusmodi bona, cum summis, etc.'" H.T. Riley
in the First Report of the Historical Manuscripts Commission,
1874, Appendix, p. 107.</p>

<p>The passage in the Wells Convocation Records is perhaps
illustrated by an entry in the Churchwardens' Accounts of the
Parish of Kingston-upon-Thames, cited by Ritson, Robin Hood, 2d
ed., I, cxviii, from Lysons, Environs of London, 1792, I, 228:</p>

<table width="300">
<tr><td>"16 Hen. 8. Rec<sup>d</sup> at the church-ale and Robynhode 
all things deducted</td><td valign="bottom">3&nbsp;10&nbsp;6."</td></tr>
</table>

<p>With this may be compared the following:</p>

<table width="300">
<tr><td>"Anno MDLXVI, or 9 of Eliz., payde for setting up 
Robin Hoodes bower</td>
<td valign="bottom">18"</td></tr>
</table>

<p>(Churchwardens' Accompts of St. Helen's [at Abingdon, Berks],
Arch&aelig;ologia, I, 18). This latter entry is loosely cited by
Ritson, I, cxiv, 2d ed., as dating from 1556. Ibidem may be found
his opinion as to R.H.'s bower (n. *). Hampson, Medii &AElig;vi
Kalendarium, I, 265, quotes this entry, also with the wrong year.
He has no doubt about the Bower: "An arbour, called Robin Hood's
Bower, was erected in the church-yard, and here maidens stood
gathering contributions." I, 283. (All the above by G.L.K.)</p>


<p>P. 46 b, note. The Sloane Manuscript cited by Ritson as No 715
is No 780 (which is bound up with 715) and is "paper, early
xviith century:" Ward, Catalogue of Romances, etc., I, 517. This
correction is also to be made at p. 121 b, note; pp. 129 a, 173
b, 175 b.</p>

<p>51 b, sts 62-66.</p>

<p>The late Miss Hamilton McKie, New Galloway, told me this
story:</p>

<p>A sturdy beggar, or luscan, came to a farm-house among the
hills and asked quarters for the night. The gudewife, before
entrusting him with the bedclothes in which to sleep in one of
the outhouses, required a pledge or security for their return. He
said he had none to offer but his Maker, and got his night's
lodging. In the morning he walked off with the bedclothes, but,
becoming bewildered in a mist, he wandered about the whole day,
and in the evening, seeing the light of a house, made towards it
and knocked at the door. A woman opened it and said, "Your
Cautioner has proved gude!" He had come back to the same
house.</p>

<p>Mactaggart gives the story in his Gallovidian Encyclopedia, p.
325, but without the trait of the security. (W. Macmath.)</p>
