<h3>FRANCIS JAMES CHILD </h3>

<p><b>Francis James Child</b> was born in Boston on the first day of
February, 1825. He was the third in a family of eight children.
His father was a sailmaker, "one of that class of intelligent
and independent mechanics," writes Professor Norton, "which has
had a large share in determining the character of our democratic
community, as of old the same class had in Athens and in
Florence." The boy attended the public schools, as a matter of
course; and, his parents having no thought of sending him to
college, he went, in due time, not to the Latin School, but to
the English High School of his native town. At that time the head
master of the Boston Latin School was Mr. Epes Sargent Dixwell,
who is still living, at a ripe old age, one of the most respected
citizens of Cambridge. Mr. Dixwell had a keen eye for scholarly
possibilities in boys, and, falling in with young Francis Child,
was immediately struck with his extraordinary mental ability. At
his suggestion, the boy was transferred to the Latin School,
where he entered upon the regular preparation for admission to
Harvard College. His delight in his new studies was unbounded,
and the freshness of it never faded from his memory. "He
speedily caught up with the boys who had already made
considerable progress in Greek and Latin, and soon took the first
place here, as he had done in the schools which he had previously
attended." Mr. Dixwell strongly advised his father to permit him
to continue his studies, and made arrangements by which his
college expenses should be provided for. The money Professor
Child repaid, with interest, as soon as his means allowed. His
gratitude to Mr. Dix-well and the friendship between them lasted
through his life.</p>

<p>In 1842 Mr. Child entered Harvard College. The intellectual
condition of the college at that time and the undergraduate
career of Mr. Child have been admirably described by his classmate
and lifelong friend, Professor Norton, in a passage which must be
quoted in full<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p01_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>: &#8212;</p>

<p>"Harvard was then still a comparatively small institution,
with no claims to the title of University; but she had her
traditions of good learning as an inspiration for the studious
youth, and still better she bad teachers who were examples of
devotion to intellectual pursuits, and who cared for those ends
the attainment of which makes life worth living. Josiah Quincy
was approaching the close of his term of service as President of
the College, and stood before the eyes of the students as the
type of a great public servant, embodying the spirit of
patriotism, of integrity, and of fidelity in the discharge of
whatever duty he might be called to perform. Among the Professors
were Walker, Felton, Peirce, Channing, Beck, and Longfellow, men
of utmost variety of temperament, but each an instructor who
secured the respect no less than the gratitude of his pupils.</p>

<p>"The class to which Child belonged numbered hardly over sixty.
The prescribed course of study which was then the rule brought
all the members of the class together in recitations and
lectures, and every man soon knew the relative standing of each
of his fellows. Child at once took the lead and kept it. His
excellence was not confined to any one special branch of study;
he was equally superior in all. He was the best in the classics,
he was Peirce's favorite in mathematics, he wrote better English
than any of his classmates. His intellectual interests were wider
than theirs, he was a great reader, and his tastes in reading
were mature. He read for amusement as well as for learning, but
he did not waste his time or dissipate his mental energies over
worthless or pernicious books. He made good use of the social no
less than of the intellectual opportunities which college life
affords, and became as great a favorite with his classmates as he
had been with his choolfellows.</p>

<p>"The close of his college course was marked by the
exceptional distinction of his being chosen by his classmates as
their Orator, and by his having the first part at Commencement as
the highest scholar in the class. His class oration was
remarkable for its maturity of thought and of style. Its
manliness of spirit, its simple directness of presentation of the
true objects of life, and of the motives by which the educated
man, whatever might be his chosen career, should be inspired,
together with the serious and eloquent earnestness with which it
was delivered, gave to his discourse peculiar impressiveness and
effect."</p>

<p>Graduating with the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1846, Mr
Child immediately entered the service of the college, in which he
continued till the day of his death. From 1846 to 1848 he was
tutor in mathematics. In 1848 he was transferred, at his own
request, to a tutorship in history and political economy, to
which were annexed certain duties of instruction in English. In
1849 he obtained leave of absence for travel and study in Europe.
He remained in Europe for about two years, returning, late in
1851, to receive an appointment to the Boylston Professorship of
Rhetoric and Oratory, then falling vacant by the resignation of
Professor Edward T. Channing.</p>

<p>The tutorships which Mr. Child had held were not entirely in
accordance with his tastes, which had always led him in the
direction of literary and linguistic study. The faculty of the
college was small, however, and it was not always possible to
assign an instructor to the department that would have been most
to his mind. But the governors of the institution were glad to
secure the services of so promising a scholar; and Mr. Child,
whose preference for an academic career was decided, had felt
that it was wise to accept such positions as the college could
offer, leaving exacter adjustments to time and circumstances.
Meantime he had devoted his whole leisure to the pursuit of his
favorite studies. His first fruits were a volume entitled Four
Old Plays,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p01_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> published in 1848, when he was but twenty-three years
old. This was a remarkably competent performance. The texts are
edited with judgment and accuracy; the introduction shows
literary discrimination as well as sound scholarship, and the
glossary and brief notes are thoroughly good. There are no signs
of immaturity in the book, and it is still valued by students of
our early drama.</p>

<p>The leave of absence granted to Mr. Child in 1849 came at a
most favorable moment. is health had suffered from close
application to work, and a change of climate had been advised by
his physicians. His intellectual and scholarly development, too,
had reached that stage in which foreign study and travel were
certain to be most stimulating and fruitful. He was amazingly
apt, and two years of opportunity meant much more to him than to
most men. He returned to take up the duties of his new office a
trained and mature scholar, at home in the best methods and
traditions of German universities, yet with no sacrifice of his
individuality and intellectual independence.</p>

<p>While in Germany Mr. Child studied at Berlin and
G&ouml;ttingen, giving his time mostly to Germanic philology,
then cultivated with extraordinary vigor and success. The hour
was singularly propitious. In the three or four decades preceding
Mr. Child's residence in Europe, Germanic philology (in the wider
sense) had passed from the stage of "romantic" dilettantism into
the condition of a well-organized and strenuous scientific
discipline, but the freshness and vivacity of the first half of
the century had not vanished. Scholars, however severe, looked
through the form and strove to comprehend the spirit. The ideals
of erudition and of a large humanity were not even suspected of
incompatibility. The imagination was still invoked as the guide
and illuminator of learning. The bond between antiquity and
medi&aelig;valist and between the Middle Ages and our own century was
never lost from sight. It was certainly fortunate for American
scholarship that at precisely this juncture a young man of Mr
Child's ardent love of learning, strong individuality, and broad
intellectual sympathies was brought into close contact with all
that was most quickening in German university life. He attended
lectures on classical antiquity and philosophy, as well as on
Germanic philology; but it was not so much by direct instruction
that he profited as by the inspiration which he derived from the
spirit and the ideals of foreign scholars, young and old. His own
greatest contribution to learning, The English and Scottish
Popular Ballads, may even, in a very real sense, be regarded as
the fruit of these years in Germany. Throughout his life he kept
a picture of William and James Grimm on the mantel over his study
fireplace.</p>

<p>Mr. Child wrote no "dissertation," and returned to Cambridge
without having attempted to secure a doctor's degree. Never eager
for such distinctions, he had been unwilling to subject himself
to the restrictions on his plan of study which candidacy for the
doctorate would have imposed. Three years after, however, in
1854, he was surprised and gratified to receive from the
University of G&ouml;ttingen the degree of Doctor of Philosophy,
accompanied by a special tribute of respect from that
institution. Subsequently he received the degree of LL.D. from
Harvard (in 1884) and that of L.H.D. from Columbia (in 1887);
but the G&ouml;ttingen Ph.D., coming as it did at the outset of his
career, was in a high degree auspicious.</p>

<p>The Boylston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory, to which,
as has been already mentioned, Mr. Child succeeded on his return
to America toward the end of 1851, was no sinecure. In addition
to academic instruction of the ordinary kind, the duties of the
chair included the superintendence and criticism of a great
quantity of written work, in the nature of essays and set
compositions prepared by students of all degrees of ability. For
twenty-five years Mr. Child performed these duties with
characteristic punctuality and devotion, though with increasing
distaste for the drudgery which they involved. Meantime a great
change had come over Harvard: it had developed from a provincial
college into a national seminary of learning, and the
introduction of the "elective system" &#8212; corresponding to
the "Lernfreiheit" of Germany &#8212; had enabled it to become a
university in the proper sense of the word. One result of the
important reform just referred to was the establishment of a
Professorship of English, entirely distinct from the old chair of
Rhetoric. This took place on May 8, 1876, and on the 20th of the
next month Mr. Child was transferred to the new professorship. His
duties as an instructor were now thoroughly congenial, and he
continued to perform them with unabated vigor to the end. In the
onerous details of administrative and advisory work, inseparable,
according to our exacting American system, from the position of a
university professor, he was equally faithful and untiring. For
thirty years he acted as secretary of the Library Council, and in
all that time he was absent from but three meetings. As chairman
of the Department of English and of the Division of Modern
Languages, and as a member of many important committees, he was
ever prodigal of time and effort. How steadily he attended to the
regular duties of the class-room, his pupils, for fifty years, are
the best witnesses. They, too, will best understand, the
satisfaction he felt that, in the fiftieth year of his teaching,
he was not absent from a single lecture. No man was ever less a
formalist; yet the most formal of natures could not, in the
strictest observance of punctilio, have surpassed the regularity
with which he discharged, as it were spontaneously, the
multifarious duties of his position.</p>

<p>Throughout his service as professor of rhetoric, Mr. Child,
hampered though he was by the requirements of his laborious
office, had pursued with unquenchable ardor the study of the
English language and literature, particularly in their older
forms, and in these subjects he had become an authority of the
first rank long before the establishment of the English
chair enabled him to arrange his uni-vesity-teaching in
accordance with his tastes. Soon after he returned from Germany
he undertook the general editorial supervision of a series of the
'British Poets,' published at Boston in 1853 and several
following years, and extending to some hundred and fifty volumes.
Out of this grew, in one way or another, his three most important
contributions to learning: his edition of Spenser, his
Observations on the Language of Chaucer and Gower, and his
English and Scottish Popular Ballads.</p>

<p>Mr. Child's Spenser appeared in 1855.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p01_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Originally intended, as
he says in the preface, as little more than a reprint of the
edition published in 1839 under the superintendence of Mr. George
Hillard, the book grew upon his hands until it bad become
something quite different from its predecessor. Securing access
to old copies of most of Spenser's poems, Mr. Child subjected the
text to a careful revision, which left little to be done in this
regard. His Life of Spenser was far better than any previous
biography, and his notes, though brief, were marked by a
philological exactness to which former editions could not
pretend. Altogether, though meant for the general reader and
therefore sparingly annotated, Mr. Child's volumes remain, after
forty years, the best edition of Spenser in existence.</p>

<p>The plan of the 'British Poets' originally contemplated an
edition of Chaucer, which Mr. Child was to prepare. Becoming
convinced, however, that the time was not ripe for such a work,
he abandoned this project, and to the end of his life he never
found time to resume it. Thomas Wright's print of the Canterbury
Tales from the Harleian manuscipt 7334<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p01_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> had, however, put into his hands
a reasonably faithful reproduction of an old text, and he turned
his attention to a minute study of Chaucer's language. The
outcome was the publication, in the Memoirs of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences for 1863, of the great treatise to
which Mr. Child gave the modest title of Observations on the
Language of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. It is difficult, at the
present day, to imagine the state of Chaucer philology at the
moment when this paper appeared. Scarcely anything, we may say,
was known of Chaucer's grammar and metre in a sure and scientific
way. Indeed, the difficulties to be solved had not even been
clearly formulated. Further, the accessible mass of evidence on
Anglo-Saxon and Middle English was, in comparison with the stores
now at the easy command of every tyro, almost insignificant. Yet,
in this brief treatise, Mr. Child not only delined the problems,
but provided for most of them a solution which the researches of
younger scholars have only served to substantiate. He also gave a
perfect model of the method proper to such inquiries &#8212; a
method simple, laborious, and exact. The Observations were
subsequently rearranged and condensed, with Professor Child's
permission, by Mr. A.J. Ellis for his work On Early English
Pronunciation; but only those who have studied them in their
original form can appreciate their merit fully. "It ought never
to be forgotten," writes Professor Skeat, "that the only full and
almost complete solution of the question of the right scansion of
Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is due to what Mr. Ellis rightly terms
the wonderful industry, acuteness, and accuracy of Professor
Child.' "Had he produced nothing else, this work, with its
pendant, the Observations on Gower,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p01_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> would have assured him a
high place among those very few scholars who have permanently
settled important problems of linguistic science.</p>

<p>Mr. Child's crowning work, however, was the edition of the
English and Scottish Popular Ballads, which the reader now has
before him. The history of this is the history of more than half
a lifetime.</p>

<p>The idea of the present work grew out of Mr. Child's editorial
labors on the series of the British Poets,' already referred to.
For this he prepared a collection in eight small volumes
(1857-58) called English and Scottish Ballads.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p01_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This was marked
by the beginnings of that method of comparative study which is
carried out to its ultimate issues in the volumes of the present
collection. The book circulated widely, and was at once admitted
to supersede all previous attempts in the same field. To Mr
Child, however, it was but the starting-point for further
researches. He soon formed the plan of a much more extensive
collection on an altogether different model. This was to include
every obtainable version of every extant English or Scottish
ballad, with the fullest possible discussion of related songs or
stories in the "popular" literature of all nations. To this
enterprise he resolved, if need were, to devote the rest of
his life. His first care was to secure trustworthy texts. In his
earlier collection he had been forced to depend almost entirely
on printed books. No progress, he was convinced, could be made
till recourse could be had to manuscripts, and in particular to
the Percy manuscript. Accordingly he directed his most earnest efforts to
securing the publication of the entire contents of the famous
folio. The Percy manuscript was at Ecton Hall, in the possession of the
Bishop's descendants, who would permit no one even to examine it.
Two attempts were made by Dr. Furnivall, at Mr. Child's instance,
to induce the owners to allow the manuscript to be printed,
&#8212; one as early as 1860 or 1861, the other in 1864,
&#8212;but without avail. A third attempt was more successful,
and in 1867-68 the long-secluded folio was made the common
property of scholars in an edition prepared by Professor Hales
and Dr. Furnivall.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p01_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The publication of the Percy manuscript not only put a large amount
of trustworthy material at the disposal of Mr. Child; it exposed
the full enormity of Bishop Percy's sins against popular
tradition. Some shadow of suspicion inevitably fell on all other
ballad collections. It was more than ever clear to Mr. Child that
he could not safely take anything at second hand, and he
determined not to print a line of his projected work till he had
exhausted every effort to get hold of whatever manuscript
material might be in existence. His efforts in this direction
continued through many years. A number of manuscripts were in
private hands; of some the whereabouts was not known; of others
the existence was not suspected. But Mr. Child was untiring. He
was cordially assisted by various scholars, antiquaries, and
private gentlemen, to whose cooperation ample testimony is borne
in the Advertisements prefixed to the volumes in the present
work. Some manuscripts were secured for the Library of Harvard
University &#8212; notably Bishop Percy's Papers, the Kiuloch
manuscripts, and the Harris manuscript,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p01_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> &#8212; and of others careful copies
were made, which became the property of the same library. In all
these operations the indispensable good olfices of Mr. William
Macmath, of Edinburgh, deserve particular mention. For a long
series of years his services were always at Mr. Child's disposal.
His self-sacrifice and generosity appear to have been equalled
only by his perseverance and wonderful accuracy. But for him the
manuscript basis of The English and Scottish Popular Ballads
would have been far less strong than it is.</p>

<p>Gradually, then, the manuscript materials came in until at
last, in 1882, Mr. Child felt justified in beginning to print.
Other important documents were, however, discovered or made
accessible as time went on. Especially noteworthy was the great
find at Abbotsford (see the Advertisement to Part VIII). In 1877
Dr. David Laing procured, "not without difficulty," leave to
prepare for Mr. Child a copy of the single manuscript of ballads
then known to remain in the library at Abbotsford. This manuscript,
entitled "Scottish Songs," was so inconsiderable, in proportion
to the accumulations which Sir Walter Scott had made in preparing
his Border Minstrelsy, that further search seemed to be
imperatively necessary. In 1890 permission to make such a search,
and to use the results, was given by the Honorable Mrs
Maxwell-Scott. The investigation, made by Mr. Macmath, yielded a
rich harvest of ballads, which were utilized in Parts
VII&#8211;IX. To dwell upon the details would be endless. The
reader may see a list of the manuscript sources at pp. 397f. of
the fifth volume; and, if he will observe how scattered they
were, he will have no difficulty in believing that it required
years, labor, and much delicate negotiation to bring them all
together. One manuscript remained undiscoverable, Tytler's Brown
manuscript, but there is no reason to believe that this contained
anything of consequence that is not otherwise known.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p01_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Meanwhile,
concurrently with the toil of amassing, collating, and arranging
texts, went on the far more arduous labor of comparative study of
the ballads of all nations; for, in accordance with Mr. Child's
plan it was requisite to determine, in the fullest manner, the
history and foreign relations of every piece included in his
collection. To this end be devoted much time and unwearied
diligence to forming, in the Library of the University, a special
collection of "Folk-lore," particularly of ballads, romances, and
M&auml;rchen. This priceless collection, the formation of which
must be looked on as one of Mr. Child's most striking services to
the university, numbers some 7000 volumes. But these figures by
no means represent the richness of the Library in the departments
concerned, or the services of Mr. Child in this particular.
Medizeval literature in all its phases was his province, and
thousands of volumes classified in other departments of the
University Library bear testimony to his vigilance in ordering
books, and his astonishing bibliographical knowledge. Very few
books are cited in the present collection which are not to be
found on the shelves of this Library.</p>

<p>In addition, Mr. Child made an effort to stimulate the
collection of such remains of the traditional ballad as still
live on the lips of the people in this country and in the British
Islands. The harvest was, in his opinion, rather scanty; yet, if
all the versions thus recovered from tradition were enumerated,
the number would not be found inconsiderable. Enough was done, at
all events, to make it clear that little or nothing of value
remains to be recovered in this way.</p>

<p>To readers familiar with such studies, no comment is
necessary, and to those who are unfamiliar with them, no form of
statement can convey even a faint impression of the industry, the
learning, the acumen, and the literary skill which these
processes required. In writing the history of a single ballad, Mr
Child was sometimes forced to examine hundreds of books in
perhaps a dozen different languages. But his industry was
unflagging, his sagacity was scarcely ever at fault, and his
linguistic and literary knowledge seemed to have no bounds. He
spared no pains to perfect his work in every detail, and his
success was commensurate with his efforts. In the Advertisement
to the Ninth Part (1894), he was able to report that the three
hundred and five numbers of his collection comprised the whole

<p>In June, 1896, Mr. Child concluded his fiftieth year of service
as a teacher in Harvard College. He was at this time hard at work
on the Tenth and final Part, which was to contain a glossary,
various indexes, a bibliography, and an elaborate introduction on
the general subject. For years he had allowed himself scarcely
any respite from work, and, in spite of the uncertain condition
of his health, &#8212; or perhaps in consequence of it, &#8226; -
he continued to work at high pressure throughout the summer. At
the end of August he discovered that he was seriously ill. He
died at Boston on them 11 the day of September. He had finished
this great work except for the introduction and the general
bibliography. The bibliography was in preparation by another hand
and has since been completed. The introduction, however, no other
scholar had the hardihood to undertake. A few pages of
manuscript, &#8212; the last thing written by his pen, &#8212;
almost illegible, were found among his papers to show that he had
actually begun the composition of this essay, and many sheets of
excerpts testified to the time he had spent in refreshing his
memory as to the opinions of his predecessors, but he had left no
collectanea that could be utilized in supplying the Introduction
itself. He was accustomed to carry much of his material in his
memory till the moment of composition arrived, and this habit
accounts for the fact that there are no jottings of opinions and
no sketch of precisely what line of argument he intended to take.</p>

<p>Mr. Child's sudden death was felt as a bitter personal loss,
not only by an unusually large circle of attached friends in both
hemispheres, but by very many scholars who knew him through his
works alone. He was one of the few learned men to whom the old
title of "Master" was justly due and freely accorded. With
astonishing erudition, which nothing seemed to have escaped, he
united an infectious enthusiasm and a power of lucid and fruitful
exposition that made him one of the greatest of teachers, and a
warmth and openness of heart that won the affection of all who
knew him. In most men, however complex their characters, one can
distinguish the qualities of the heart, in some degree, from the
qualities of the head. In Professor Child no such distinction was
possible, for all the elements of his many-sided nature were
fused in his marked and powerful individuality. In his case, the
scholar and the main cannot be separated. his life and his
learning were one; his work was the expression of himself.</p>

<p>As an investigator Professor Child was at once the inspiration
and the despair of his disciples. Nothing could surpass the
scientific exactness of his methods and the unwearied diligence
with which he conducted his researches. No possible source of
information could elude him; no book or manuscript was too
voluminous or too unpromising for him to examine on the chance of
its containing some fact that might correct or supplement his
material, even in the minutest point. Yet these qualities of
enthusiastic accuracy and thoroughness, admirable as they
undoubtedly were, by no means dominated him. They were always at
the command of the higher qualities of his genius, &#8212;
sagacity, acumen, and a kind of sympathetic and imaginative power
in which he stood almost alone among recent scholars. No detail
of language or tradition or arch&aelig;ology was to him a mere
lifeless fact; it was transmuted into something vital, and
became a part of that universal humanity which always moved him
wherever be found it, whether in the pages of a medi&aelig;val
chronicle, or in the stammering accents of a late and vulgarly
distorted ballad, or in the faces of the street boys who begged
roses from his garden. No man ever felt a keener interest in his
kind, and no scholar ever brought this interest into more
vivifying contact with the technicalities of his special studies.
The exuberance of this large humanity pervades his edition of the
English and Scottish ballads. Even in his last years, when the
languor of uncertain health sometimes got the better, for a
season, of the spirit with which he commonly worked, some fresh
bit of genuine poetry in a ballad, some fine trait of pure nature
in a stray folk-tale, would, in an instant, bring back the full
flush of that enthusiasm which he must have felt when the
possibilities of his achievement first presented themselves to
his mind in early manhood. For such a nature there was no old
age.</p>

<p>From this ready sympathy came that rare faculty &#8212; seldom
possessed by scholars &#8212;which made Professor Child
peculiarly fit for his greatest task. Few persons understand the
difficulties of ballad investigation. In no field of literature
have the forger and the manipulator worked with greater vigor and
success. From Percy's day to our own it has been thought an
innocent device to publish a bit of one's own versifying, now and
then, as an "old ballad" or an "ancient song." Often, too, a
late stall-copy of a ballad, getting into oral circulation, has
been innocently furnished to collectors as traditional matter.
Mere learning will not guide an editor through these
perplexities. What is needed is, in addition, a complete
understanding of the "popular" genius, a sympathetic
recognition of the traits that characterize oral literature
wherever and in whatever degree they exist. This faculty, which
even the folk has not retained, and which collectors living in
ballad-singing and tale-telling times have often failed to
acquire, was vouchsafed by nature herself to this sedentary
scholar. In reality a kind of instinct, it had been so cultivated
by long and loving study of the traditional literature of all
nations that it had become wonderfully swift in its operations
and almost infallible. A forged or retouched piece could not
deceive him for a moment; he detected the slightest jar in the
genuine ballad tone. He speaks in one place of certain writers "
who would have been all the better historians for a little
reading of romances." He was himself the better interpreter of
the poetry of art for this keen sympathy with the poetry of
nature.</p>

<p>Constant association with the spirit of the folk did its part
in maintaining, under the stress of unremitting study and
research, that freshness and buoyancy of mind which was the
wonder of all who met Professor Child for the first time, and the
perpetual delight of his friends and associates. It is impossible
to describe the charm of his familiar conversation. There was
endless variety without effort. His peculiar humor, taking shape
in a thousand felicities of thought and phrase that fell casually
and as it were inevitably from his lips, exhilarated without
reaction or fatigue. His lightest words were full of fruitful
suggestion. Sudden strains of melancholy or high seriousness were
followed, in a moment, by flashes of gaiety almost boyish. And
pervading it all one felt the attraction of his personality and
the goodness of his heart.</p>

<p>Professor Child's humor was not only one of his most striking
characteristics as a man; it was of constant service to his
scholarly researches. Keenly alive to any incongruity in thought
or fact, and the least self-conscious of men, he scrutinized his
own nascent theories with the same humorous shrewdness with which
he looked at the ideas of others. It is impossible to think of
him as the sponsor of some hypotheses which men of equal eminence
have advanced and defended with passion; and, even if his
goodness of nature had not prevented it, his sense of the
ridiculous would not have suffered him to engage in the
absurdities of philological polemics. In the interpretation of
literature, his humor stood him in good stead, keeping his native
sensibility under due control, so that it never degenerated into
sentimentalism. It made him a marvelous interpreter of Chaucer,
whose spirit he had caught to a degree attained by no other
scholar or critic.</p>

<p>To younger scholars Professor Child was an influence at once
stimulating and benignant. To confer with him was always to be
stirred to greater effort, but, at the same time, the serenity of
his devotion to learning chastened the petulance of immature
ambition in others. The talk might be quite concrete, even
definitely practical, &#8212; it might deal with indifferent
matters; but, in some way, there was an irradiation of the
master's nature that dispelled all unworthy feelings. In the
presence of his noble modesty the bustle of self-assertion was
quieted and the petty spirit of pedantic wrangling could not
assert itself. However severe his criticism, there were no
personalities in it. He could not be other than outspoken,
&#8212; concealment and shuffling were abhorrent to him, &#8212;
yet such was his kindliness that his frankest judgments never
wounded; even his reproofs left no sting. With his large charity
was associated, as its necessary complement in a strong
character, a capacity for righteous indignation. "He is almost
the only man I know," said one in his lifetime, "who thinks no
evil." There could be no truer word. Yet when he was confronted
with injury or oppression, none could stand against the anger of
this just man. His unselfishness did not suffer him to see
offences against himself, but wrong done to another roused him in
an instant to protesting action.</p>

<p>Professor Child's publications, despite their magnitude and
importance, are no adequate measure either of his acquirements or
of his influence. He printed nothing about Shakspere, for
example, yet he was the peer of any Shaksperian, past or present,
in knowledge and interpretative power. As a Chaucer scholar he
had no superior, in this country or in Europe: his published work
was confined, as we have seen, to questions of language, but no
one had a wider or closer acquaintance with the whole subject. An
edition of Chaucer from his hand would have been priceless. His
acquaintance with letters was not confined to special authors or
centuries. He was at home in modern European literature and
profoundly versed in that of the Middle Ages. In his immediate
territory, &#8212; English, &#8212; his k no w-ledge, linguistic
and literary, covered all periods, and was alike exact and
thorough. His taste and judgment were exquisite, and he
enlightened every subject which he touched. As a writer, he was
master of a singularly felicitous style, full of individuality
and charm. Had his time not been occupied in other ways, he would
have made the most delightful of essayists.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Professor Child's courses of instruction in the
university &#8212; particularly those on Chaucer and Shakspere
&#8212;gave him an opportunity to impart to a constantly
increasing circle of pupils the choicest fruits of his life of
thought and study. In his later years he had the satisfaction to
see grow up about him a school of young specialists who can have
no higher ambition than to be worthy of their master. But his
teaching was not limited to these, &#8212; it included all sorts
and conditions of college students; and none, not even the idle
and incompetent, could fail to catch something of his spirit. One
thing may be safely asserted: no university teacher was ever
more beloved.</p>

<p>And with this may fitly close too slight a tribute to the
memory of a great scholar and a good man. Many things remain
unsaid. His gracious family life, his civic virtues, his
patriotism, his bounty to the poor, &#8212; all must be passed by
with a bare mention, which yet will signify much to those who
knew him. In all ways he lived worthily, and he died having
attained worthy ends.</p>
