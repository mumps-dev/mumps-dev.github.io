<h3>The Rising in the North</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Risinge in the Northe,' Percy Manuscript, p. 256;
Hales and Furnivall, II, 210. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d17501.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Printed in Percy's Reliques, 1765, 1, 250, "from two
Manuscript copies, one of them in the editor's folio collection.
They contained considerable variations, out of which such
readings were chosen as seemed most poetical and consonant to
history." Bearing in mind Percy's express avowal that he "must
plead guilty to the charge of concealing his own share in
amendments under some such general title as a modern copy, or the
like," one would conclude without hesitation that there was but a
single authentic text in this case, as in others. Percy notes on
the margin of his manuscript: "N.B. To correct this by my other
copy, which seems more modern. The other copy in many parts
preferable to this." But this note would seem to be a private
memorandum. Or are we to suppose that Percy might employ, from
habit perhaps, the same formula, not to say artifice, with
himself as with the public? In notes in the Folio to
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_176.html">Northumberland Betrayed by Douglas</a>' (No 176), Percy speaks of a
second copy of that ballad also as being in his possession, and
describes it as containing much which is omitted in the other,
and as beginning like '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_177.html">The Earl of Westmoreland</a>,' (No 177). Of
the beginning of this last he says, in a note in the Folio,
"these lines are given in one of my old copies to Lord
Northumberland." "Old copies" is staggering; for any one who
examines the variations of the texts in the Reliques from the
texts in the Folio will find them of the same character and style
as Percy's acknowledged improvements of other ballads, and will
be compelled to impute them to the editor or his double.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d175_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, having for a
time succeeded, by exuberant professions, in allaying very
sufficiently grounded suspicions of their loyal dealing, at last,
upon receiving the Queen's summons to London, found compliance
unsafe, and went into rebellion. They took this step with but
half a heart and against their judgment, overcome by the clamor
and urgency of a portion of their fellow-conspirators. The intent
of the insurgents was, in Northumberland's own words, "the
reformation of religion, and the preservation of the Queen of
Scots, whom they accounted by God's law and man's law to be right
heir, if want should be of issue of the Queen's Majesty's body."
These two causes, they were confident, were favored by the larger
number of noblemen within the realm.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d175_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Protestantism had no
hold in the north, and the Queen's officers in those parts were,
for the moment, not strong enough to make opposition. With
leaders of energy and military skill, and a good chest to draw
upon,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d175_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> the rising would have been highly dangerous. As things
were, it collapsed in five weeks without the shedding of a drop
of blood; but hundreds of simple people were subsequently
hanged.</p>

<p>The earls, with others, among whom Richard Norton, then
sheriff of York, was the most conspicuous, entered Durham in arms
on Sunday, the fourteenth of November (1569). They went to the
minster, overthrew the communion-table, tore the Bible and
service-books, replaced the old altar (which had been thrown into
a rubbish-heap), and had mass said. The next day they turned
southwards, with nobody to molest or stop them in their rear or
in front. The Earl of Sussex was collecting a force at York, but
it came in slowly, and it could not be trusted. "To get the more
credit among the favorers of the old Romish religion, they had a
cross, with a banner of the five wounds, borne after them,
sometime by old Norton, sometime by others" (Holinshed). They
proceeded to Ripon, Wetherby, and Clifford Moor (Bramham Moor)
near Tadcaster. " Their main body was at Wetherby and Tadcaster,
their advanced horse were far down across the Ouse." Their
numbers, according to Holinshed, never exceeded about two
thousand horse and five thousand foot. Tutbury, where Mary Stuart
was confined, was but a little more than fifty miles from their
advance; they proposed to release the Queen of Scots, and then to
move on London, or wait for a rising in the south. Mary Stuart,
at the nick of time, was removed to Coventry. On the
twenty-fourth we hear that the rebels were drawn back to
Knaresborough and Boroughbridge; on the thirtieth, that they are
returned into the Bishopric. There they laid siege to Barnard
Castle, which Sir George Bowes was obliged to surrender on
December twelfth; on the fifteenth the earls were still at
Durham. On the thirteenth the earls of Warwick and Clinton,
commanders of the Army of the South, met at Wetherby with a
combined force of eleven thousand foot and above twelve hundred
horse, "eager to encounter the rebels, if they would abide." But
on the sixteenth the "lords rebels" warned their footmen to shift
for themselves, and fled with such horse as they had left into
Northumberland. The twenty-second of December, the Earl of
Sussex, qui cunctando restituit rem, Lord Hunsdon, who had been
joined with him in command, and Sir Ralph Sadler, who had been
deputed to watch him, write to the Queen: "The earls rebels, with
their principal confederates and the Countess of Northumberland,
did the twentieth of this present in the night, flee into
Liddesdale with about a hundred horse; and there remain under the
conduction of Black Ormiston, one I, of the murtherers of the
Lord Darnley, and John of the Side and the Lord's Jock, two
notable thieves of Liddesdale, and the rest of the rebels be
utterly scaled."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d175_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The ballad, which is the work of a loyal but not unsympathetic
minstrel, gives but a cursory and imperfect account of "this
geere." Earl Percy has come to the conclusion that he must fight
or flee; his lady urges him thrice over to go to the court, and
right himself, but he tells her that his treason is known well
enough; if he follows her advice she will never see him again. He
sends a letter to Master Norton, urging that gentleman to ride
with him. Norton asks counsel of his son Christopher, who advises
him not to go back from the word he has spoken, and much pleases
his father thereby. He asks his nine sons how many of them will
take part with him. All but the eldest at once answer that they
will stand by him till death: Francis Norton, the eldest, will
not advise acting against the crown. Coward Francis, thou never
tookest that of me! says the father. Francis will go with his
father, but unarmed, and he wishes an ill death to them that
strike the first stroke against the crown. There is a muster at
Wetherby, and Westmoreland and Northumberland are there with
their proper banners,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d175_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and with another setting forth the
Lord on the cross. Sir George Bowes "rising to make a spoil,"
they besiege him in a castle to which he retires, easily win the
outer walls, but cannot win the inner. Word comes to the Queen of
the rebels in the north; she sends thirty thousand men against
them, under the "false" Earl of Warwick, and they never stop till
they reach York. (A gap occurs here, which need not be a large
one, considering the leaps taken already.) Northumberland is
gone, Westmoreland vanished, and Norton and his eight sons
fled.</p>

<p>5-10. The Countess of Northumberland would have been the last
person to give such advice as is attributed to her. "His wife,
being the stouter of the two, doth encourage him to persevere,
and rideth up and down with the army, so as the grey mare is the
better horse." Hunsdon to Cecil, November twenty-sixth,
Manuscript cited by Froude.</p>

<p>11-27. Richard Norton, miscalled Francis in 40, was a man of
seventy-one when he engaged in the rising, and the father of
eleven sons and eight daughters. Seven of the sons were involved
in the rebellion. Francis, the eldest son, so far from standing
out, took a prominent part with his father. But what is said of
Francis is true of William, the fourth son. Sir George Bowes says
of him: "I neither heard or could perceive William Norton to deal
with any office or charge amongst the rebels, but, as I have
heard it affirmed, he both refused the taking charge of horsemen
when it was offered unto him, and also would wear no armor.
Farther, upon my departure from the castle [Barnard Castle], he
came to me, and in the way as he rode with me, he entered to
declare that he greatly misliked of all their doings and
practices, saying that he was there amongst them for his father's
sake, and to accompany him, and otherways he never had been with
them," etc. Manuscript cited by Sharp, p. 284.</p>

<p>Christopher Norton deserves the distinction accorded him in
the ballad. "Christopher had been among the first to enroll
himself a knight of Mary Stuart. His religion had taught him to
combine subtlety with courage, and through carelessness or
treachery, or his own address, he had been admitted into Lord
Scrope's guard at Bolton Castle. There he was allowed to assist
his lady's escape, should escape prove possible; there he was
able to receive messages and carry them; there, to throw the
castellan off his guard, he pretended to flirt with her
attendants, and twice at least, by his own confession, closely as
the prisoner was watched, he contrived to hold private
communications with her." (Froude, Reign of Elizabeth, III, 505,
where follow lively particulars of these two encounters.)
Christopher was the only one of the Nortons who is known to have
suffered the death-penalty of treason; it was "after he had
beheld the death of his uncle, as well his quartering as
otherwise, knowing and being well assured that he himself must
follow the same way." (Sharp, p. 286.) Richard Norton, the
father, fled to Flanders with his sons Francis and Sampson, and
all three seem to have died there.</p>

<p>33 f. Sussex to Cecil: Dec. 6. "The rebels have shot three
days together at the wall of the outer ward, but they have done
no hurt." Dec. 8. "The rebels have won the first ward." Sir
George Bowes' men leaped the walls, one day some eighty at a
time, and the next day seven or eight score of the best disposed,
who had been appointed to guard the gates, suddenly set them
open, and went to the rebels; whereupon Sir George was driven to
composition, and there was no need to take the inner
walls.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d175_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A considerable number of "balletts" were called forth by the
northern rebellion, and a few of these have been preserved. See
