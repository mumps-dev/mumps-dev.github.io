<p><b>A</b>. The young Lord of Lorn, when put to school, learns
more in one day than his mates learn in three. He returns home
earlier than was expected, and delights his father with the
information that he can read any book in Scotland. His father
says he must now go to France to learn the tongues. His mother is
anxious that he should have a proper guardian if he goes, and the
'child' proposes the steward, who has impressed him as a man of
fidelity. The Lady of Lorn makes the steward a handsome present,
and conjures him to be true to her son. If I am not, he answers,
may Christ not be true to me. The young lord sails for France,
very richly appointed. Once beyond the water, the steward will
give the child neither penny to spend nor meat and drink. The
child is forced to lie down at some piece of water to quench his
thirst; the steward pushes him in, meaning to drown him. The
child offers everything for his life; the steward pulls him out,
makes him put off all his fine clothes and don a suit of leather,
and sends him to shift for himself, under the name of Poor
Disaware. A shepherd takes him in, and he tends sheep on a lonely
lea.</p>

<p>The steward sells the child's clothes, buys himself a suit fit
for a lord, and goes a-wooing to the Duke of France's daughter,
calling himself the Lord of Lorn; the duke favors the suit, and
the lady is content. The day after their betrothal, the lady,
while riding out, sees the child tending his sheep, and hears him
mourning. She sends a maid to bring him to her, and asks him
questions, which he answers, not without tears. He was born in
Scotland, his name is Poor Disaware; he knows the Lord of Lorn, a
worthy lord in his own country. The lady invites him to leave his
sheep, and take service with her as chamberlain; the child is
willing, but her father objects that the lord who has come
a-wooing may not like that arrangement. The steward comes upon
the scene, and is angry to find the child in such company. When
the child gives his name as Poor Disaware, the steward denounces
him as a thief who had robbed his own father; but the duke speaks
kindly to the boy, and makes him his stable-groom. One day, when
he is watering a gelding, the horse flings up his head and hits
the child above the eye. The child breaks out, Woe worth thee,
gelding! thou hast stricken the Lord of Lorn. I was born a lord
and shall be an earl; my father sent me over the sea, and the
false steward has beguiled me. The lady happens to be walking in
her garden, and hears something of this; she bids the child go on
with his song; this he may not do, for he has been sworn to
silence. Then sing to thy gelding, and not to me, she says. The
child repeats his story, and adds that the steward has been
deceiving both her and him for a twelvemonth. The lady declares
that she will marry no man but him that stands before her, sends
in haste to her father to have her wedding put off, and writes an
account of the steward's treachery to the old lord in Scotland.
The old lord collects five hundred friends of high degree, and
goes over to France in search of his son. They find him acting as
porter at the duke's palace. The men of worship bow, the
serving-men kneel, the old lord lights from his horse and kisses
his son. The steward is just then in a castle-top with the duke,
and sees what is going on below. Why are those fools showing such
courtesy to the porter? The duke fears that this means death for
one of them. The castle is beset; the steward is captured, is
tried by a quest of lords and brought in guilty, is hanged,
quartered, boiled, and burned. The young Lord of Lorne is married
to the duke's daughter.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. <b>B</b> is an abridgment of an older copy. The
story is the same as in <b>A</b> in all material particulars. The
admiration of the school-master and the self-complacency of his
pupil in <b>A</b> 2, 3, <b>B</b> 3, are better justified in
<b>B</b> by a stanza which has perhaps dropped out of

<p>The last six stanzas are not represented in <b>A</b>, and the
last two are glaringly modern; but there is a foundation for
62-64 in a romance from which the story is partly taken, the
History of Roswall and Lillian.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d271_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>'Roswall and Lillian.' Roswall was son to the king of Naples.
Happening one day to be near a prison, he heard three lords, who
had been in durance many years for treason, putting up their
prayers for deliverance. He was greatly moved, and resolved to
help them out. The prison-keys were always hidden for the night
under the king's pillow. Roswall possessed himself of them while
his father was sleeping, set the lords free, and replaced the
keys. The escape of the prisoners was reported the next morning,
and the king made a vow that whoever had been instrumental to it
should be hanged; if he came within the king's sight, the king
would even slay him with his own hands. It soon came to light
that the guilty party was none other than the prince. The queen
interceded for her son, but the king could not altogether
disregard his vow: the prince must be kept out of his sight, and
the king promptly decided that Roswall should be sent to reside
with the king of Bealm, under charge of the steward, a stalwart
knight, to whom the queen promised everything for good service.
As the pair rode on their way, they came to a river. The prince
was sore athirst, and dismounted to take a drink. The steward
seized him by the feet as he bent over the water, and vowed to
throw him in unless he would swear an oath to surrender his money
and credentials, and become servant where he had been master. To
these hard terms Roswall was forced to consign. When they were
near the king of Bealm's palace, the steward dropped Roswall's
company, leaving him without a penny to buy his dinner; then rode
to the king, presented letters, and was well received. Roswall
went to a little house hard by, and begged for harbor and
victuals for a day. The mistress made him welcome. She saw he was
from a far country, and asked his name. Dissawar was his name; a
poor name, said the old wife, but Dissawar you shall not be, for
I will help you. The next day Roswall was sent to school with the
dame's son. He gave his name as Dissawar again to the master; the
master said he should want neither meat nor teaching. Roswall had
been a remarkable scholar at home. Without doubt he astonished
the master, but this is not said, for the story has been abridged
here and elsewhere. In about a month, the steward of the king of
Bealm, who had observed his beauty, courtesy, and good parts,
carried him to the court of Bealm, where Roswall made himself a
general favorite. The princess Lillian, only child of the king of
Bealm, chose him to be her chamberlain, fell in love with him,
and frankly offered him her heart, an offer which Roswall,
professing always to be of low degree, gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>At this juncture the king of Bealm sent messengers to Naples
proposing marriage between his daughter Lillian and the young
prince who had been commended to him. The king of Naples assented
to the alliance, and deputed lords and knights to represent him
at the solemnity. The king of Bealm proclaimed a joust for the
three days immediately preceding the wedding. Lillian's heart was
cold, for she loved none but Dissawar. She told Dissawar that he
must joust for his lady; but he said that he had not been bred to
such things, and would rather go a-hunting. A-hunting he went,
but before he got to work there came a knight in white weed on a
white steed, who enjoined him to take horse and armor and go to
the jousting, promising that he should find plenty of venison
when he came back. Roswall toomed many a saddle, turned the
steward's heels upward, made his way back to the wood, in spite
of the king's order that he should be stopped, resumed his
hunting-gear, took the venison, which, according to promise, was
waiting for him, and presented himself and it to his lady. The
order is much the same on the two succeeding days. A red knight
equips Roswall for the joust on the second day, a knight in gold
on the third. The steward is, on each occasion, put to shame, and
in the last encounter two of his ribs are broken.</p>

<p>When Roswall came back to the wood after the third jousting,
the three knights appeared together and informed him that they
were the men whom he had delivered from prison, and who had
promised to help him if help he ever needed. They bade him have
no fear of the steward. Lillian had suspected from the second day
that the victor was Roswall, and when he returned to her from his
third triumph she intimated that if he would but tell the whole
truth to her father their mutual wish would be accomplished. But
Roswall kept his counsel very whimsically, unless it was out of
respect to his oath and Lillian was constrained to speak for
herself, for the marriage was to be celebrated on the fourth day.
She asked her father in plain terms to give her Dissawar for her
husband. The king replied, not unkindly, that she could not marry
below her rank, and therefore must take the prince who had been
selected for her; and to the steward she was married, however
sorely against her will. In the course of the wedding-dinner, the
three Neapolitan lords entered the hall, and saluted the king,
the queen, and Lillian, but not the bridegroom. The king asked
why they did no homage to their prince; they replied that they
did not see their prince, went in search of Roswall, and brought
him in. The force of the oath, or the consciousness of an
obligation, must have been by this time quite extinct, for
Roswall divulged the steward's treacherous behavior, and
announced himself as the victor at the jousts. The steward was
hanged that same day; then they passed to the kirk and married
Roswall and Lillian. There was dancing till supper and after
supper, the minstrels played with good will, and the bridal was
kept up for twenty days.</p>

<p>Roswall and Lillian belongs with a group of popular tales of
which the original seems to have been characterized by all or
many of the following marks: (1) the son of a king liberates a
man whom his father has imprisoned; (2) the penalty for so doing
is death, and to save his life the prince is sent out of the
country, attended by a servant; (3) the servant forces the prince
to change places and clothes with him; (4) presents himself at a
king's court as prince, and in his assumed quality is in a fair
way to secure the hand of the king's daughter; (5) the true
prince, figuring the while as a menial (stable-groom, scullion,
gardener's lad), is successful, by the help of the man whom he
has liberated, in a thrice-repeated contention (battle, tourney,
race), or task, after which he is in a position to make known his
rank and history; (6) the impostor is put to death, and the
prince (who has, perhaps, in his humbler capacity, already
attracted her notice and regard) marries the princess.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d271_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Two Slavic tales, a Bosnian and a Russian, come as near as any
to the story of our romance.</p>

<p>A king who has caught a wild man shuts him up, and denounces
death to any one that shall let him out. The king's son's bedroom
is just over the place in which the wild man is confined. The
prince cannot bear to hear the continual wailings which come up,
and he sets the prisoner free. The prince confesses what he has
done; the king is persuaded by his advisers to banish his son
rather than to enforce the penalty which he had decreed; the
prince is sent off to a distant kingdom, attended by a servant.
One day the prince was seized with thirst while travelling, and
wished to get a drink from a well; but there was nothing to draw
water with, and he ordered his servant to let him down to the
surface of the water, holding him the while by the legs. This was
done; but when the prince had drunk to his satisfaction, the
servant refused to draw him up until he had consented to change
places and clothes, and had sworn besides to keep the matter
secret. When they arrived at the court of the king designated by
the father, the sham prince was received with royal honors, and
the true prince had to consort with servants... After a time, the
king, wishing to marry off his daughter, proclaimed a three days'
race, open to all comers, the prize to be a golden apple, and any
competitor who should win the apple each of the three days to
have the princess. Our prince had fallen in love with the young
lady, and was most desirous to contend. The wild man had already
helped him in emergencies here passed over, and did not fail him
now. He provided his deliverer with fine clothes and a fine
horse. The prince carried off the apple at each of the races, but
disappeared as soon as he had the prize in hand. All the efforts
of the king to find out the victor were to no purpose, but one
day the princess met the prince in his serving-man's dress, and
saw the apples shining from his breast. She told her father. The
prince did not feel himself bound to further secrecy; he told
everything; the king gave him the princess, and the servant was
properly disposed of.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d271_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Ivan, the tsar's son, releases from confinement Bulat, a
robber, whom the tsar has kept in prison three and thirty years.
Bulat tells Ivan to call him by name in case of future need, and
he will not fail to appear. Ivan travels in foreign countries
with his servant, and feeling thirsty of a warm day tells his
servant to get him water from a deep well to which they have
come; Ivan will hold him by a rope tied firmly about him, so that
he can go down into the well without danger. The servant
represents that he is the heavier of the two, too heavy for his
master to hold, and that for this reason it would be better for
Ivan himself to go for the water. Ivan is let down into the well,
and having drunk his fill calls to his servant to draw him up.
The servant refuses to draw him up unless Ivan will swear to give
him a certificate in writing that he is master, and Ivan servant.
The paper is given; they change clothes, and proceed on their
journey, and come to Tsar Pantui's kingdom. Here the servant is
received as a tsar's son, and when he tells Tsar Pantui that the
object of his coming is to woo his daughter, the tsar complies
with much pleasure. Ivan, at the servant's suggestion, is put to
low work in the kitchen. Before long the kingdom is invaded, and
the tsar calls upon his prospective son-in-law to drive off the
enemy, for which service he shall receive the princess, but
without it, not. The false Ivan begs the true Ivan to take the
invaders in hand, and he assents without a word. Ivan calls for
Bulat: one attacks the hostile army on the right, the other on
the left, and in an hour they lay a hundred thousand low. Ivan
returns to his kitchen. A second invasion, and a third, on a
larger and larger scale, ensue, and Ivan and Bulat repulse the
enemy with greater and greater loss. Ivan each time goes back to
his kitchen; his servant has all the glory, and after the third
and decisive victory marries the princess. Ivan gets permission
from the cook to be a spectator at the wedding-banquet. The
tsar's daughter, it must now be observed, had overheard the
conference between the pseudo-prince and Ivan, and even that
between Ivan and Bulat, and had hitherto, for inscrutable
reasons, let things take their course. But when she saw Ivan
looking at the feast from behind other people, she knew him at
once, sprang from the table, brought him forward, and said, This
is my real bridegroom and the savior of the kingdom; after which
she entered into a full explanation, with the result that the
servant was shot, and Ivan married to the tsar's
daughter.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d271_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

variation of the color of armor and horses occurs in <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>, an extremely frequent trait in tales and romances; see
Ward, Catalogue of Romances, etc., 734 f., Lengert, XVII, 361.
(Very striking in the matter of the tournaments is the
resemblance of the romance of Ipomedon to Roswall and Lillian.
Ipomedon, like Roswall, professes not to have been accustomed to
such things, and pretends to go a-hunting, is victorious three
successive days in a white, red, black suit, on a white, bay,
black steed, vanishes after the contest, and presently reappears
as huntsman, with venison which a friend had been engaged in
securing for him.) (6) The treacherous attendant is put to death,
<b>A</b>. The hero of course marries the princess in all the
tales.</p>

<p>The points in the romance which are repeated in the ballad are
principally these: The young hero is sent into a foreign country
under the care of his father's steward. The steward, by
threatening to drown him while he is drinking at a water-side,
forces him to consent to an exchange of positions, and strips him
of his money; then passes himself off as his master's son with a
noble personage, who eventually fixes upon the impostor as a
match for his only daughter. The young lord, henceforth known as
Dissawar,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d271_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> is in his extremity kindly received into an humble
house, from which he soon passes into the service of the lady
whose hand the steward aspires to gain. The lady bestows her love
upon Dissawar, and he returns her attachment. In the upshot they
marry, the false steward having been unmasked and put to
death.</p>

<p>What is supplied in the ballad to make up for such passages in
the romance as are omitted is, however, no less strictly
traditional than that which is retained. Indeed, were it not for
the name Dissawar, the romance might have been plausibly treated,
not as the source of the ballad, but simply as a kindred story;
for the exquisite tale of 'The Goose Girl' presents every
important feature of 'The Lord of Lorn,' the only notable
difference being that the young lord in the ballad exchanges
parts with the princess in the tale, an occurrence of which
instances have been, from time to time, already indicated.</p>

<p>In 'Die G&auml;nsemagd,' Grimms, No 89, II, 13, ed. 1857, a
princess is sent by her mother to be wedded to a bridegroom in a
distant kingdom, with no escort but a maid. Distressed with
thirst, the princess orders her maid to get down from her horse
and fetch her a cup of water from a stream which they are
passing. The maid refuses; she will no longer be servant, and the
princess has to lie down and drink from the stream. So a second
and a third time: and then the servant forces her mistress, under
threat of death, to change horses and clothes, and to swear to
keep the matter secret at the court to which they are bound.
There the maid is received as princess, while the princess is put
to tending geese with a boy. The counterfeit princess, fearing
that her mistress's horse, Falada, may tell what he has observed,
induces the young prince to cut off Falada's head. The princess
has the head nailed up on a gate through which she passes when
she takes out the geese, and every morning she addresses Falada
with a sad greeting, and receives a sad return. The goose-boy
tells the old king of this, and the next day the king hides
behind the gate and hears what passes between the goose-girl and
Falada. The king asks an explanation of the goose-girl when she
comes back in the evening, but the only answer he elicits is that
she has taken an oath to say nothing. Then the king says, If you
will not tell me your troubles, tell them to the stove; and the
princess creeps into the oven and pours out all her grief: how
she, a king's daughter, has been made to change places with her
servant, and the servant is to marry the bridegroom, and she
reduced to tend geese. All this the king hears from outside of
the room through the stovepipe, and he loses no time in repeating
it to his son. The false maid is dragged through the streets in a
barrel stuck full with nails, and the princess married to the
prince to whom she had been contracted.</p>

<p>The passage in the ballad in which the Lord of Lorn relates to
the gelding, within hearing of the duke's daughter, the injuries
which he had sworn to conceal has, perhaps, suffered some
corruption, though quibbling as to oaths is not unknown in
ballads. The lady should be believed to be out of earshot, as the
king is thought to be by the goose-girl. Unbosoming one's self to
an oven or stove, is a decidedly popular trait; "the unhappy and
the persecuted betake themselves to the stove, and to it bewail
their sufferings, or confide a secret which they may not disclose
to the world."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d271_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> An entirely similar passage (but without an
oath to secrecy) occurs in Basile's Pentamerone, II, 8, where a
girl who has been shamefully maltreated by her uncle's wife tells
her very miserable story to a doll, and is accidentally overheard
by the uncle. The conclusion of the tale is quite analogous to
that of the goose-girl.</p>
