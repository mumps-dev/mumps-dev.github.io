Catnach's is a better copy than that of Pitts. See

<p>P. 459 a. For a late German ballad on the Moringer story ('von
dem Markgrafen Backenweil') see Bolte, Zeitschrift des Vereins
f&uuml;r Volkskunde, III, 65-7, and for notes of dramas upon the
theme, pp. 62-4. I do not observe that I have anywhere referred
to the admirably comprehensive treatment of the subject by von
Tettau, Ueber einige bis jetzt unbekannte Erfurter Drucke des 15.
Jahrhunderts, Ritter Morgeners Wallfahrt, pp. 75-123. The book
did not come into my hands till two years after my preface was
written.</p>
