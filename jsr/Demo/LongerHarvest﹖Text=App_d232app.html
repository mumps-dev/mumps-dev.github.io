<h3>Richie Story</h3>

<h3>Appendix</h3>

<p>Aytoun, II, 239, says of 'Richie Storie,' The words, recast in
a romantic form and applied to a more interesting subject, have
been set to music by a noble lady, and are now very popular under
the title of 'Huntingtower.' The history of 'Huntingtower' is not
so well known as might be expected. I have not been able to
ascertain the authorship or the date of its first appearance
(which was very probably in society rather than in print).
'Richie Storie' is not carried by our texts further back than
1802-3 (<b>B</b>, <b>H</b>). Kinloch published in 1827 a ballad
from recitation, 'The Duke of Athol,' which is 'Huntingtower'
passed through the popular mouth; for 'Huntingtower' became, and
has continued to be, a favorite with the people. Christie,
Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 166, says that he had often heard
'The Duke of Athol' in his early years, and he gives eight
stanzas which do not differ remarkably from Kinloch's ballad.</p>

<p>The marks of the derivation of 'Huntingtower' are the
terminations of lines 1, 2, 4 of each stanza, and substantial
agreements in the last two stanzas with <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>E</b>, 5, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, 4, and with <b>B</b>
6, <b>C</b> 7, <b>H</b>, respectively. The name Huntingtower
occurs only in <b>B</b> 6 of 'Richie Storie.' The author of
'Huntingtower' was no doubt possessed of a version of 'Richie
Storie' which had its own peculiarities.</p>

<p>'Huntingtower' is too well known to require citing. It has
been often printed; as, for example, in Mr. G.F. Graham's Popular
Songs of Scotland, revised by J. Muir Wood, Balmoral Editiou,
Glas- gow, 1887, p. 152; The Songs of Scotland, the words revised
by Dr. Charles Mackay, p. 5, London, Boosey &amp; Co. (Altered by
the Baroness Nairne, and very little left of it, Life and Songs
of the Baroness Nairne, edited by the Rev. Charles Rogers, 1872,
p. 177.) The pleasing air strongly resembles, says Mr. Wood, one
in D'Urfey's Pills to Purge Melancholy, V, 42, ed. 1719.</p>

<p>'The Duke of Athol' may be given for the interest it has as a
popular <i>rifacimento</i>.</p>

<h3>The Duke of Athol</h3>

<p>"Taken down from the recitation of an idiot boy in Wishaw;"
Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads, p. 170.</p>
