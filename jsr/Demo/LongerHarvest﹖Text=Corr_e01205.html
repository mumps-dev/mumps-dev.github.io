<p>Among C.K. Sharpe's papers, and in his handwriting, is a piece
in dialogue between Mother and Son headed, Death of Lord Rounal,
a Gaelic ballad founded on a tradition of his receiving poison by
treachery at the castle of his mistress' father, and dying on his
return home. This is the familiar Scottish ballad made over in
English and mildly sentimental phraseology. All the Celtic in it
is "dark Dungael, the chief of meikle guile," the father.</p>

<p>P. 153 a. <b>German</b>. Two other copies in B&ouml;hme's Erk,
No 190 b, I, 582.</p>

<p>[154 a; IV, 449 b. <b>Danish</b>. 'Den forgivne Datter,'
Grundtvig-Olrik, No 341, Ridderviser, I, 146 ff., two versions:
<b>A</b> = Kristensen, Jyske Folkeminder, No 92, X, 358;
<b>B</b>, that communicated to Professor Child by Professor
Grundtvig and mentioned in I, 154. Olrik mentions 7
<b>Swedish</b> copies, 5 of them unprinted.]</p>

<p>156 a, III, 499 b, V, 208 b. 'Donna Lombarda.' See Archivio,
X, 380. [See also 'Utro F&aelig;stem&oslash; vil forgive sin
F&aelig;stemand,' in the Grundtvig-Olrik collection, No 345,
Ridderviser I, 165 ff., 3 versions <b>A</b>-<b>C</b> (<b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, from Manuscript sources going back in part to the 16th
century; <b>C</b>, from oral tradition, printed by Kristensen,
Jyske Folkeminder, No 19, 1, 49, No 56, X, 234). Olrik, in an
elaborate introduction, studies the relations of the Danish
ballad (which is found also in Norse, Bugge's Manuscript
collections, No. 221) to 'Donna Lombarda' and to the history of
the sixth century Lombard queen Rosemunda. He opposes the views
of Gaston Paris, Journal des Savants, 1889, pp. 616 ff., and
holds that 'Donna Lombarda,' 'Utro F&aelig;stem&oslash;,' (his No
345), 'Giftblandersken' (his No 344), 'Fru Gundela' (see above
<b>I</b>, 156 b), and the Slavic ballads of the sister who
poisons her brother at the instigation of her lover, are all
derived from the <i>saga</i> of Rosemunda. He even regards 'Old
Robin of Portingale,' No 80, II, 240, as related to the 'Utro
F&aelig;stem&oslash;.' See below, p. 295.]</p>

<p>156 b, 499 a, II, 499 a, III, 499. The ballad of the maid who
poisons her brother and is rejected by the man she expects to win
in Lithuanian, Bartsch, Dainu Balsai, I, 172 ff., No 123 a, b.
More ballads of poisoning, sister poisoning brother at the
instance of her lover, girl poisoning her lover, and at col. 306
one resembling Lord Randal, Herrmann, Ethnologische Mitteilungen
aus Ungarn, I, cols 292-308 (with an extensive bibliography).
Herrmann's collections upon this theme are continued from cols
89-95, 203-11. [Cf. the Danish ballad 'Tule Slet, Ove Knar og Fru
Magnild,' Grundtvig-Olrik, No. 350, Ridderviser, I, 186, where,
however, the murderess uses a knife.]</p>

<p>157. Compare, for dialogue and repetition, the Catalan ballad
'El Conde Arnau,' Mil&aacute;, Romancerillo, No 78, p. 67; where,
however, the first half of the third line is also regularly
repeated in the fourth.</p>
