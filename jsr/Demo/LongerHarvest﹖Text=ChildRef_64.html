<p><b>G</b>, as printed by Finlay, was made up from various
fragments. Of his twenty-seven stanzas fourteen were taken from
<b>C</b>, and these are now omitted. <b>A</b> 13, <b>D</b> 5,
<b>G</b> 4, 5, <b>C</b> 19, are fonnd also in some copies of
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_62.html">Fair Annie</a> of Loch-royal;' <b>C</b> 19 also in 'Sweet Willie and
Fair Annie.' The very inappropriate question in <b>F</b> 4, "O
will ye gang to the cards, Meggie," occurs in Jamieson's 'Clerk
Saunders,' I, 84, st. 5. The inquiry in <b>G</b> 1, "Will you
<i>burn</i> for Sweet Willie?" may probably have been suggested
by the ballad of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_65.html">Lady Maisry</a>.' We have the oath by the thorn,
<b>G</b> 13, in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_67.html">Glasgerion</a>.' For the conclusion of A<b>,</b>
<b>E</b>, see No 7, I, 96 ff.</p>

<p>Fair Janet, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b> [Annet, MaisryJ,
loving Sweet Willie, and on the point of becoming a mother by
him, is destined by her father to marry a French lord, <b>A</b>;
a Southland lord, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>. She implores
Willie to fly with her over sea, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>; to good
green wood, <b>F</b>. They set sail, but her condition obliges her
to return, <b>B</b>; her time comes before they can get away,
<b>C</b>. She bears a child.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d064_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> To avoid discovery, the babe is
taken to Willie's mother, who very readily assumes charge of it.
Scarcely has the child been born, when Janet's father comes with
orders to busk the bride, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>(?),
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>. She begs to be tenderly handled, as not being
in good plight. They attire her gayly, and she selects Willie to
lead her horse, or ride before her on her horse, to church,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>. Her cheek is pale, her color goes
and comes; it is suspected, and even suggested, that she has
borne a bairn, or is near to doing so, <b>A</b> 22, <b>C</b> 14,
<b>D</b> 10, <b>E</b> 11, <b>F</b> 25. She seeks to clear herself
by an ambiguous oath, <b>E</b> 12, <b>G</b> 26, 27; Willie does
this for her, <b>G</b> 11. After dinner, or supper, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, dancing is in order. Janet makes excuses to her
brothers, her father, the bridegroom's man, and declines very
decidedly the bridegroom's own invitation, with marked asperity
in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. But with Willie she will dance though her
heart shuuld break in three. She takes three turns, and falls down
dead. Willie gives the key of his coffer to his man, and bids him
tell his mother that his horse has slain him. He would not
survive Janet in any pure and full form of the story, and does
not in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>.</p>

<p>'Sweet William,' Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 307, borrows some
stanzas at the beginning from 'Fair Janet.'</p>

<p>There are points of resemblance between 'Fair Janet' and a
ballad very popular in Scandinavia and in Germany, which demand
notice, though they may not warrant the assumption of community
of origin.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian ballad is: <b>Danish</b>, 'Kong Valdemar og
hans S&oslash;ster,' Grundtvig, No 126, III, 63 ff, 911 f,
<b>A</b>-<b>I</b>; <b>G</b> from a sixteenth-century manuscript,
<b>A</b>-<b>F</b> from seventeenth-century manuscripts or print,
the two last from recent tradition. <b>Icelandic</b>,
'Soff&iacute;u kv&aelig;&eth;i,' &Iacute;slenzk
Fornkv&aelig;&eth;i, No 52, II, 152, <b>A</b>-<b>F</b>, all of
which, according to Grundtvig, must be put, at latest, in the
seventeenth century, though some are first met with in the
eighteenth. <b>F&auml;r&ouml;e</b>, a single copy, almost Danish,
from the beginning of this century, printed by Grundtvig, III, 67
f. <b>Norwegian</b>, three copies from recent tradition,

<p>According to the Scandinavian story, a king is informed by his
queen, her inexorable enemy, that Kirstin, his sister, has just
borne a child. The king sends for Kirstin, who is at some
distance, to come to him immediately. She is obliged to make the
journey on horseback. Upon her arrival the king puts her to a
variety of tests, among these a long dance. Kirstin comes off so
well that her brother says the queen has belied her. The queen
then bares Kirstin's breast and makes milk flow from it. The king
hereupon sends for heavy whips, and flogs his sister to the point
of death. In the Icelandic and F&auml;r&ouml;e versions Kirstin
dies of the dance, in her brother's arms. In the Swedish versions
and in Danish <b>I</b> the king is Kirstin's father, not her
brother. The Norwegian versions and Swedish <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>
have a false conclusion: Kirstin survives, and is united to her
lover. In Danish <b>A</b> the king had, before he learned the
state of things, promised his sister to the son of the King of
England, and in Danish <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, Swedish
<b>F</b>, and the F&auml;r&ouml;e ballad, Kirstin's lover is an
English prince, who, in Danish <b>H</b>, comes to claim his
mistress, and, finding her dead, kills the king. In Swedish
<b>A</b> Kirstin dances with four, dances with five, dances with
all the men of the court, and in Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>H</b> she
tires out successively all the courtiers, the king, and the
queen.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, far the best preserved of the German versions, makes
a hunter ask a count for his sister Annchristine. Being refused,
as an unequal match, he tells the count that his sister, for all
her nobility, has borne a child. The count maintains Annchristine
to be a maid. The hunter says, Send for her, and see. The young
lady is required to come on horseback. When her brother sees her
approaching, with her long hair flowing, his confidence is
strengthened. The hunter says, Make her dance. She dances seven
hours, and her brother finds reason to continue of the same mind
as before. The hunter says, Let us tighten her lacing, and, when
that is done, milk springs from her breasts. Her brother gives
her the choice between whipping and the sword. She chooses the
former. He beats her till liver and lung; spring from her body.
She then calls on him to stop; Prince Frederick of England is his
brother-in-law. The count is much troubled, and promises
everything if she will live. But Annchristine dies, and presently
Prince Frederick appears. He has heard of what the count has
done, cuts him to bits, and gives him to the crows.</p>

<p>In the other German versions the informant is generally of low
rank, and sometimes professes to be father of the child. In
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>K</b> he is a
kitchey-boy, a personage who plays no insignificant part in
romantic story. The coming on horseback is wanting. The long
dance is found in <b>B</b>-<b>F</b>. The father or the child is
always the English King, who runs the brother through with his
sword, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>. <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>L</b>, or otherwise gives him his due.</p>

<p>The slight resemblance and the great difference of the
Scottish story are apparent. Fair Janet has to go a certain
distance on horseback, at a time when she is peculiarly ill
fitted to do so, like the hapless Kirstin of the Scandinavian
ballads and the German <b>A</b>, and she dies from dancing in her
weak condition, as the lady does in the Icelandic and
F&auml;r&ouml;e ballad. But both the ride and the dance are
incidental to her forced marriage, and neither the ride nor the
dance is employed as a test, as the dance always is in the other
ballad, and as the ride is expressly devised to be in German
<b>A</b> 6. The Scottish Janet is not constrained to dance, nor
does she dance down all the men in the room. She declines every
invitation except Willie's, and this, in some cases she (very
naturally and touchingly) encourages or incites; and her vital
powers give way after three turns. All the unspeakably ferocious
features of the Norse and German ballads are wanting, and the
bound which divides the pathetic from the horrible is never
passed.</p>

<p>A Breton ballad, 'Ar C'homt Gwillou,' 'Prinses ar Gwillou,'
'Le Comte Guillou,' 'La Princesse Le Guillou,' Luzel, II, 6-15,
in three versions, has the probation by dancing. A count or
prince, returning to his mistress after a considerable absence,
happens to hear a shepherdess singing a song, of which he himself
is unfortunately the subject. The lady has had a child. Fearing
to encounter her injured lover, she tries to pass off as a
younger sister for herself, but, as may be imaginged, this
desperate artifice does not succeed. She is told what is said of
her, and hopes she may melt like butter if ever she had daughter
or son. The count calls out, Play up musicians, that we may see
how this damsel will step out. The young woman pleads that she is
suffering from fever, and cannot dance just now, but the count
strikes her on the breast so that milk spurts on her gown,
<b>A</b>. He kills her.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d064_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>There is also a Magyar ballad, in which a jealous or offended
lover makes his mistress dance till her boots are full of blood,
as Kjersti's are in Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>: 'Darvas Kis
Clement,' Aigner, p. 110.</p>

<p>One or two correspodences with the Scandinavian-German ballad
will require to be noted under '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_65.html">Lady Maisry</a>,' which immediately
follows.</p>

<p><b>A</b> is translated by Knorts, Schottische Balladen, No 7;
<b>F</b> by Gerhard, p. 97; a combination of <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>
and others by Grundtvig, No 39.</p>
