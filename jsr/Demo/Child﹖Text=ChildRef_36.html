<h3>The Laily Worm and the Machrel of the Sea</h3>

<a name="Page_I_315"/>
<ol type="A">
<li>Skene Manuscript, p. 30: taken down from recitation in the
north of Scotland, in 1802 or 1803. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d03601.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Somewhat mutilated, and also defaced, though it be, this
ballad has certainly never been retouched by a pen, but is pure
tradition. It has the first stanza in common with '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_34.html">Kemp Owyne</a>,'
and shares more than that with '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_35.html">Allison Gross</a>.' But it is
independent of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_35.html">Allison Gross</a>,' and has a far more original
sound. Maisry's services in washing and combing are more
conceivable when rendered by a maid in her proper shape, as in
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_35.html">Allison Gross</a>,' than when attributed to a machrel of the sea; and
it is likely that the machrel returned to her own figure every
Saturday, and that this is one of the points lost from the story.
It is said, here as in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_35.html">Allison Gross</a>,' that Maisry kames the
laily head on her knee.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d036_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It would be a mere cavil to raise a
difficulty about combing a laily worm's head. The fiery beast in
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_34.html">Kemp Owyne</a>,' <b>A</b>, has long hair, and the laily worm may
have had enough to be better for combing.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d036_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>It is only natural that the transformed maid should not wish
to trust herself again in the hands of the stepmother, but it is
not according to poetical justice that she should remain a
machrel of the sea, and here again we may suppose something to
have dropped out.</p>

<p>We have had a double transformation, of sister and brother, in
the 'Marriage of Gawain' and in the 'Wedding of Gawen and Dame
Ragnell,' and again, with a second sister added, in the story of
&Aacute;ls&oacute;l. Brother and
<a name="Page_I_316"/>
sister are transformed in the
Danish 'Nattergalen,' Grundtvig, No 57. It is an aggravation of
stepmother malice that the victim of enchantment, however amiable
and inoffensive before, should become truculent and destructive;
so with the brother of Gawain's bride, and with the Carl of
Carlile. The stepmother is satisfactorily disposed of, as she is
in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_34.html">Kemp Owyne</a>,' <b>B</b>, and the 'Laidly Worm of Spindleston
Heughs.'</p>
