<p>Three stanzas of this ballad were printed in 1812 (<b>C</b>).
I followed in 1825, a full copy, which would have been a very
good one had it been given as taken down, and not restored "to
something like poetical propriety."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d208_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The editor of the " old
song " observes that it was one of the most popular in the north
of England for a long period after the event which it records,
and a glance at what is here brought together will show that the
ballad was at least equally popular in Scotland. <b>I</b> is
repeated in Richardson's Borderer's Table-Book, VI, 291, and in
Harland and Wilkinson's Ballads and Songs of Lancashire, 1882, p.
265. Mr. J.H. Dixon, in Notes and Queries, 4th Series, XI, 389,
says that the ballad "originally appeared in the Town and Country
Magazine."</p>

<p>'Lord Derwentwater's Goodnight,' Hogg's Jacobite Relics, II,
30, 268, was both communicated and composed by Robert Surtees.
'Derwentwater,' Cromek's Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song,
1810, p. 127, is from the pen of Allan Cunningham. It is repeated
in Hogg's Jacobite Relics, 1821, II, 28, and in Cunningham's
Songs of Scotland, 1825, III, 192, etc.; also in Kinloch
Manuscripts, V, 413, with two lines to fill out an eighth stanza.
(Translated by Lo&egrave;ve-Veimars, p. 375.) 'Young Ratcliffe,'
Sheldon's Minstrelsy of the English Border, p. 400, is another
ballad of the same class.</p>

<p>James Ratcliffe, Earl of Derwentwater, being suspected or
known to be engaged in concerting a rising in the north of
England in behalf of the Pretender, a warrant was issued by the
Secretary of State for his apprehension, towards the end of
September, 1715. Hereupon he took arms, and he was one of the
fifteen hundred English and Scots who were forced to an
inglorious surrender at Preston, November 14. The more
distinguished prisoners were conveyed to London, where they had a
boisterous reception from the mob. Derwentwater was committed to
the Tower, December 9; was impeached of high treason, and pleaded
guilty, in January; was sentenced to death, February 9, at
Westminster Hall, and was executed February 24 (1716). In a paper
which he read from the scaffold he stated that he had regarded
his plea of guilty as a formality consequent upon his "having
submitted to mercy," and declared that he had never had "any
other but King James the Third for his rightful and lawful
sovereign."</p>

<p>Derwentwater had not attained the age of twenty-seven at the
time of his death. We may believe that the character given of him
by the renegade Patten was not overcharged: "The sweetness of his
temper and disposition, in which he had few equals, had so
secured him the affection of all his tenants, neighbors, and
dependants that multitudes would have lived and died with him.
The truth is, he was a man formed by nature to be generally
beloved, for he was of so universal a beneficence that he seemed
to live for others. As he lived among his own people, there he
spent his estate, and continually did offices of kind ness and
good neighborhood to everybody, as opportunity offered. He kept a
house of generous hospitality and noble entertainment, which few
in that country do, and none come up to. He was very charitable
to poor and distressed families on all occasions, whether known
to him or not, and whether Papist or Protestant. His fate will be
sensibly felt by a great many who had no kindness for the cause
he died in."</p>

<p>The king's letter, which, in the ballad, summons Derwentwater
to London (to answer for his head, <b>D</b> 3), suggests the
Secretary of State's warrant of arrest, which his lordship,
unhappily for himself, evaded. But very probably the ballad-maker
supposed Derwentwater to have gone home after his less than six
weeks in arms. As he is setting forth to obey the mandate, his
wife calls to him from child-bed to make his will. This business
does not delay him long: one third of his estate is to be his
wife's, and the rest to go to his children. (He had a son not two
years old at the date of his execution, and a daughter who must
have been born, at the earliest, not much before the rising. His
very large estates first passed to the crown, and were afterwards
bestowed on Greenwich hospital.) Bad omens attend his departure.
As he mounts his horse, his ring drops from his finger, or
breaks, and his nose begins to bleed, <b>B</b> 5, <b>D</b> 6,
<b>E</b> 8, <b>F</b> 9, <b>H</b> 7, <b>I</b> 10; presently his
horse stumbles, <b>A</b> 8, <b>E</b> 9, <b>F</b> 10, <b>I</b> 11;
it begins to rain, <b>H</b> 8. When he comes to London, to
Westminster Hall, <b>B</b> 6, <b>F</b> 11, to Whitehall, <b>D</b>
7, rides up Westminster Street, in sight of the White Hall,
<b>I</b> 12, the lords and knights, the lords and ladies, a mob,
<b>H</b> 9, call him "traitor." How can that be, he answers, with
surprise or indignation, except for keeping five hundred men
(five thousand, seven thousand, eight score), to fight for King
Jamie? <b>A</b> 10, <b>D</b> 8, <b>E</b> 11, <b>F</b> 12,
<b>H</b> 10, <b>I</b> 13. A man with an ax claims his life, which
he ungrudgingly resigns, <b>B</b> 8, <b>D</b> 9, 10, <b>E</b> 12,
13, <b>F</b> 13, 14, <b>H</b> 11, 12, <b>I</b> 14, 15, directing
that a good sum of money which he has in his pockets shall be
given to the poor, <b>A</b> 12, <b>D</b> 11, <b>E</b> 14,
<b>F</b> 15, <b>1</b> 17.</p>

<p>In <b>A</b> 2, <b>D</b> 12, Derwentwater seems to be taken for
a Scot.</p>

<p>Ellis, Brand's Antiquities, 1813, II, 261, note, remarks that
he had heard in Northumberland that when the Earl of Derwentwater
was beheaded, the stream (the Divelswater) that runs past his
seat at Dilston Hall flowed with blood.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d208_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The Northern Lights (perhaps the red-colored ones) were
peculiarly vivid on the night of February 16, 1716, and were long
called Lord Derwentwater's Lights in the north of England, where,
it is said, many of the people know (or knew) them by no other
name. It was even a popular belief that the aurora borealis was
first seen on that night: Notes and Queries, Third Series, IX,
154, 268; Gibson, Dilston Hall, p. 111.</p>

<p>The omen of nose-bleed occurs in the ballad of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_216.html">The Mother's Malison</a>,'
No 216, <b>C</b>; both nose-bleed and horse-stumbling,
as omens, in Webster's Dutchess of Malfi, Act II, Scene 2, Dyce,
1859, p. 70, cited, with other cases, in Ellis's ed. of Brand's
Antiquities, II, 497.</p>

<p>'Brig. Macintosh's Farewell to the Highlands,' or 'Macintosh
was a Soldier Brave,' is one half a Derwentwater ballad: see
Harland's Ballads and Songs of Lancashire, 1865, p. 75, Ritson's
Northumberland Garland, p. 85, Hogg's Jacobite Relics, II, 102,
etc.</p>
