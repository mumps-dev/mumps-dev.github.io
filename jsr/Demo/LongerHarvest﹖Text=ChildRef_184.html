<h3>The Lads of Wamphray</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Glenriddell Manuscripts, XI, 34, 1791. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d18401.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>'Lads of Wamphray, ane old ballad, sometimes called The
Galiard,' is the superscription in the manuscript. Printed in
Scott's Minstrelsy, I, 208, 1802, II, 148, 1833; with the
omission of 4 and 36, the insertion of four verses after 8, two
transpositions, and some changes of language.</p>

<p>"The following song celebrates the skirmish, in 1593, betwixt
the Johnstones and Crichtons, which led to the revival of the
ancient quarrel betwixt Johnstone and Maxwell, and finally to the
battle of Dryffe Sands, in which the latter lost his life.
Wamphray is the name of a parish in Annandale. Lethenhall was the
abode of Johnstone of Wamphray, and continued to be so till of
late years. William Johnstone of Wamphray, called the Galliard,
was a noted freebooter. A place near the head of Teviotdale
retains the name of the Galliard's Faulds (folds), being a
valley, where he used to secrete and divide his spoil with his
Liddesdale and Eskdale associates. His <i>nom de guerre</i> seems to
have been derived from the dance called the galliard. The word is
still used in Scotland to express an active, gay, dissipated
character. Willie of the Kirkhill, nephew to the Galliard, and
his avenger, was also a noted Border robber."</p>

<p>"Leverhay, Stefenbiggen, Girth-head, etc., are all situated in
the parish of Wamphray. The Biddes-burn, where the skirmish took
place betwixt the Johnstones and their pursuers, is a rivulet
which takes its course among the mountains on the confines of
Nithesdale and Annandale. The Wellpath is a pass by which the
Johnstones were retreating to their fastnesses in Annandale.
Ricklaw-holin is a place upon the Evan water, which falls into
the Annan below Moffat. Wamphray-gate was in these days an
alehouse." Scott's Minstrelsy, I, 208 ff., ed. 1802.</p>

<p>This affair is briefly noticed in the Historic of King James
the Sext in the following terms: "Sum unbrydlit men of Johnestons
... hapnit to ryd a steiling in the moneth of Julij this present
yeir of God 1593, in the lands and territoreis pertening to the
Lord Sanquhar and the knyghtis of Drumlanryg, Lag and Closburne,
upon the watter of Nyth; whare, attoure the great reaf and spulye
that thay tuik away with violent hand, thay slew and mutilat a
great nomber of men wha stude for defence of thair a win geir and
to reskew the same from the hands of sik vicious revers."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d184_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> p.
297.</p>

<p>It is hard to determine whether the first eight stanzas of the
ballad are anything more than a prelude, and whether 5, 7 note
the customary practice of the Lads of Wamphray, or anticipate, as
is done in 3, certain points in the story which follows. The gap
after 8 is filled by Scott with verses which describe the
Galliard as incapable of keeping his hands from another man's
horse, and as having gone to Nithsdale to steal Sim Crichton's
dun. The Galliard makes an unlucky selection from the Crichton
stable, and takes a blind horse instead of the coveted dun. Under
the impression that he has the right beast, he calls out to Sim
to come out and see a Johnstone ride. The Crichtons mount for
pursuit; the Galliard sees that they will be up with him, and
tries to hide behind a willow-bush. Resistance is vain, for there
is no other man by but Will of Kirkhill; entreaties and promises
are bootless; the Crichtons hang the Galliard high. Will of
Kirkhill vows to avenge his uncle's death, and to this end goes
back to Wamphray and raises a large band of riders, who proceed
to Nithsdale and drive off the Crichtons' cattle. On the return
the Johnstones are followed or intercepted by the Crichtons; a
fight ensues, and the Crichtons suffer severely. Will of Kirkhill
boasts that he has killed a man for every finger of the Galliard.
The Johnstones drive the Crichtons' nout to Wamphray.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d184_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>There is a story, not sufficiently authenticated, that Lord
Maxwell, while engaged in single combat with Johnstone, at the
battle of Dryf esands, "was slain behind his back by the cowardly
hands of Will of Kirkhill." The New Statistical Account of
Scotland, IV, 148, note *.</p>
