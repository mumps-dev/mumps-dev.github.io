</ol>

<p>We have here again half a ballad, in seven fragments, but the
essentials of the story, which is well known from other versions,
happen to be preserved, or may be inferred.</p>

<p>Arthur, apparently some day after Christmas, had been
encountered at Tarn Wadling,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d031_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in the forest of Inglewood, by
a bold baron armed with a club, who offered him the choice of
fighting, or ransoming himself by coming back on New Year's day
and bringing word what women most desire. Arthur puts this
question in all quarters, and having collected many answers, in
which, possibly, he had little confidence, he rides to keep his
day. On the way he meets a frightfully ugly woman; she intimates
that she could help him. Arthur promises her Gawain in marriage,
if she will,
<a name="Page_I_289"/>
and she imparts to him the right answer. Arthur
finds the baron waiting for him at the tarn, and presents first
the answers which he had collected and written down. These are
contemptuously rejected. Arthur then says that he had met a lady
on a moor, who had told him that a woman would have her will. The
baron says that the misshapen lady on the moor was his sister,
and he will burn her if he can get hold of her. Upon Arthur's
return he tells his knights that he has a wife for one of them,
and they ride with the king to see her, or perhaps for her to
make her choice. When they see the bride, they decline the match
in vehement terms, all but Gawain, who is somehow led to waive "a
little foul sight and misliking." She is bedded in all her
repulsiveness, and turns to a beautiful young woman. To try
Gawain's compliance further, she asks him whether he will have
her in this likeness by night only or only by day. Putting aside
his own preference, Gawain leaves the choice to her, and this is
all that is needed to keep her perpetually beautiful. For a
stepmother had witched her to go on the wild moor in that fiendly
shape until she should meet some knight who would let her have
all her will. Her brother, under a like spell, was to challenge
men either to fight with him at odds or to answer his hard
question.</p>

<p>These incidents, with the variation that Arthur (who does not
show all his customary chivalry in this ballad) waits for
Gawain's consent before he promises him in marriage, are found in
a romance, probably of the fifteenth century, printed in Madden's
Syr Gawayne, and somewhat hastily pronounced by the editor to be
"unquestionably the original of the mutilated poem in the Percy
folio."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d031_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Arthur, while hunting in Ingleswood, stalked and finally shot
a great hart, which fell in a fern-brake. While the king, alone
and far from his men, was engaged in making the assay, there
appeared a groom, bearing the quaint name of Gromer Somer
Joure,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d031_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> who grimly told him that he meant now to requite him
for having taken away his lands_ Arthur represented that it would
be a shame to knighthood for an armed man to kill a man in green,
and offered him any satisfaction. The only terms Gromer would
grant were that Arthur should come back alone to that place that
day twelvemonth, and then tell him what women love best; not
bringing the right answer, he was to lose his head. The king gave
his oath, and they parted. The knights, summoned by the king's
bugle, found him in heavy cheer, and the reason he would at first
tell no man, but after a while took Gawain into confidence.
Gawain advised that they two should ride into strange country in
different directions, put the question to every man and woman
they met, and write the answers in a book. This they did, and
each made a large collection. Gawain thought they could not fail,
but the king was anxious, and considered that it would be prudent
to spend the only month that was left in prosecuting the inquiry
in the region of Ingleswood. Gawain agreed that it was good to be
speering, and bade the king doubt not that some of his saws
should help at need.</p>

<p>Arthur rode to Ingleswood, and met a lady, riding on a
richly-caparisoned palfrey, but herself of a hideousness which
beggars words; nevertheless the items are not spared. She came up
to Arthur and told him that she knew his counsel; none of his
answers would help. If he would grant her one thing, she would
warrant his life; otherwise, he must lose his head. This one
thing was that she should be Gawain's wife. The king said this
lay with Gawain; he would do what he could, but it were a pity to
make Gawain wed so foul a lady. " No matter," she rejoined, "
though I be foul: choice for a mate hath an owl. When thou
<a name="Page_I_290"/>
comest
to thine answer, I shall meet thee; else art thou lost."</p>

<p>The king returned to Carlisle with a heart no lighter, and the
first man he saw was Gawain, who asked how be had sped. Never so
ill: he had met a lady who had offered to save his life, but she
was the foulest he had ever seen, and the condition was that
Gawain should be her husband. "Is that all?" said Gawain. "I will
wed her once and again, though she were the devil; else were I no
friend." Well might the king exclaim, "Of all knights thou
bearest the flower!"</p>

<p>After five or six days more the time came for the answer. The
king had hardly ridden a mile into the forest when he met the
lady, by name Dame Ragnell. He told her Gawain should wed her,
and demanded her answer. "Some say this and some say that, but
above all things women desire to have the sovereignty; tell this
to the knight; he will curse her that told thee, for his labor is
lost." Arthur, thus equipped, rode on as fast as he could go,
through mire and fen. Gromer was waiting, and sternly demanded
the answer. Arthur offered his two books, for Dame Ragnell had
told him to save himself by any of those answers if he could.
"Nay, nay, king," said Gromer, "thou art but a dead man." "Abide,
Sir Gromer, I have an answer shall make all sure. Women desire
sovereignty." "She that told thee that was my sister, Dame
Ragnell; I pray I may see her burn on a fire." And so they
parted.</p>

<p>Dame Ragnell was waiting for Arthur, too, and would hear of
nothing but immediate fulfillment of her bargain. She followed
the king to his court, and required him to produce Gawain
instantly, who came and plighted his troth. The queen begged her
to be married privately, and early in the morning. Dame Ragnell
would consent to no such arrangement. She would not go to church
till high-mass time, and she would dine in the open hall. At her
wedding she was dressed more splendidly than the queen, and she
sat at the head of the table at the dinner afterwards. There her
appetite was all but as horrible as her person: she ate three
capons, three curlews, and great bake meats, all that was set
before her, less and more.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d031_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A leaf is wanting now, but what followed is easily imagined.
She chided Gawain for his offishness, and begged him to kiss her,
at least. "I will do more," said Gawain, and, turning, beheld the
fairest creature he ever saw. But the transformed lady told him
that her beauty would not hold: he must choose whether she should
be fair by night and foul by day, or fair by day and foul by
night.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d031_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Gawain said the choice was hard, and left all to her.
"Gramercy," said the lady, "thou shalt have me fair both day and
night." Then she told him that her step-dame had turned her into
that monstrons shape by necromancy, not to recover her own till
the best knight in England had wedded her and given her
sovereignty in all points.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d031_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A charming little scene follows,
vv 715-99, in which Arthnr visits Gawain in the morning, fearing
lest the fiend may have slain him. Something of this may very
likely have been in that
<a name="Page_I_291"/>
half page of the ballad which is lost
after stanza 48.</p>

<p>Gower and Chancer both have this tale, though with a different
setting, and with the variation, beyond doubt original in the
story, that the man whose life is saved by rightly answering the
question has himself to marry the monstrous woman in return for
her prompting him.</p>

<p>Gower relates, Confessio Amantis, Book First, I, 89-104, ed.
Pauli, that Florent, nephew of the emperor, as Gawain is of
Arthur, slew Branchus, a man of high rank. Branchus's kin
refrained from vengeance, out of fear of the emperor; but a
shrewd lady, grandmother to Branchus, undertook to compass
Florent's death in a way that should bring blame upon nobody. She
sent for Florent, and told him that she would engage that he
should not be molested by the family of Branchus if he could
answer a question she would ask. He was to have a proper
allowance of time to find the answer, but he was also to agree
that his life should be forfeited unless his answer were right.
Florent made oath to this agreement, and sought the opinions of
the wisest people upon the subject, but their opinions were in no
accord. Considering, therefore, that he must default, he took
leave of the emperor, adjuring him to allow no revenge to be
taken if he lost his life, and went to meet his fate. But on his
way through a forest he saw an ugly old woman, who called to him
to stop. This woman told him that he was going to certain death,
and asked what he would give her to save him. He said, anything
she should ask, and she required of him a promise of marriage.
That he would not give. "Ride on to your death, then," said she.
Florent began to reflect that the woman was very old, and might
be hidden away somewhere till she died, and that there was no
other chance of deliverance, and at last pledged his word that he
would marry her if it should turn out that his life could be
saved only through the answer that she should teach him. She was
perfectly willing that he should try all other shifts first, but
if they failed, then let him say that women cared most to be
sovereign in love. Florent kept back this answer as long as he
could. None of his own replies availed, and the lady who presided
in judgment at last told him that he could be allowed but one
more. Then he gave the old woman's answer, and was discharged,
with a curse on her that told.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d031_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The old woman was waiting for Florent, and he now had full
leisure to inspect all her points; but he was a knight, and would
hold his troth. He set her on his horse before him, rode by night
and lay close by day, till he came to his castle. There the
ladies made an attempt to attire her for the wedding, and she was
the fouler for their pains. They were married that night. He
turned away from the bride; she prayed him not to be so
discourteous. He turned toward her, with a great moral effort,
and saw (for the chamber was full of light) a lady of eighteen,
of unequalled beauty. As he would have drawn her to him she
forbade, and said he must make his choice, to have her such by
day or by night. "Choose for us both," was his reply. "Thanks,"
quoth she, "for since you have made me sovereign, I shall be both
night and day as I am now." She explained that, having been
daughter of the king of Sicily, her stepmother had forshapen her,
the spell to hold till she had won the love and the sovereignty
of what knight passed all others in good name.</p>

<p>The scene of Chaucer's tale, The Wife of Bath, returns to
Arthur's court. One of the bachelors of the household, when
returning from hawking, commits a rape, for which he is condemned
to death. But the queen and other ladies intercede for him, and
the king leaves his life at the disposal of the queen. The queen,
like the shrewd lady in Gower, but with no intent to trapan the
young man, says that his life shall depend upon his being able
<a name="Page_I_292"/>
to
tell her what women most desire, and gives him a year and a day
to seek an answer. He makes extensive inquiries, but there is no
region in which two creatures can be found to be of the same
mind, and he turns homeward very downcast.</p>

<p>On his way through a wood he saw a company of ladies dancing,
and moved towards them, in the hope that he might learn something.
But ere he came the dancers had vanished, and all he found was
the ugliest woman conceivable sitting on the green. She asked the
knight what he wanted, and he told her it was to know what women
most desire. "Plight me thy troth to do the next thing I ask of
thee, and I will tell thee." He gave his word, and she whispered
the secret in his ear.</p>

<p>The court assembled, the queen herself sitting as justice, and
the knight was commanded to say what thing women love best. He
made his response triumphantly; there was no dissenting voice.
But as soon as he was declared to have ransomed his life, up
sprang the old woman he had met in the wood. She had taught the
man his answer, he had plighted his word to do the first thing
she asked of him, and now she asked him to make her his wife. The
promise was not disputed, but the poor youth begged her to make
some other request; to take all he had in the world, and let him
go. She would not yield, and they were married the next day. When
they have gone to bed, the old wife, "smiling ever mo," rallies
her husband for his indifference, and lectures him for objecting
to ugliness, age, and vulgar birth, which things, she says, are a
great security for him, and then gives him his election, to have
her ugly and old as she is, but true, or young and fair, with the
possible contingencies. The knight has the grace to leave the
decision to her. "Then I have the sovereignty," she says, "and I
will be both fair and good; throw up the curtain and see." Fair
and young she was, and they lived to their lives' end in perfect
joy.</p>

<p>Chaucer has left out the step-mother and her bewitchment, and
saves, humbles, and rewards the young knight by the agency of a
good fairy; for the ugly old woman is evidently such by her own
will and for her own purposes. She is "smiling ever mo," and has
the power, as she says, to set all right whenever she pleases.
Her fate is not dependent on the knight's compliance, though his
is.</p>

<p>The Wife of Bath's Tale is made into a ballad, or what is
called a sonnet, 'Of a Knight and a Fair Virgin,' in The Crown
Garland of Golden Roses, compiled by Richard Johnson, not far
from 1600: see the Percy Society reprint, edited by W. Chappell,
vol. vi of the series, p. 68. Upon Chaucer's story is founded
Voltaire's tale, admirable in its way, of Ce qui pla&icirc;t aux
Dames, 1762; of which the author writes, 1765, November 4, that
it had had great success at Fontainebleau in the form of a comic
opera, entitled La F&eacute;e Urg&egrave;le.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d031_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The amusing

<p>Tales resembling the Marriage of Gawain must have been widely
spread during the Middle Ages. The ballad of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_32.html">King Henry</a>' has
much in common with the one now under consideration, and Norse
and Gaelic connections, and is probably much earlier. At present
I can add only one parallel out of English, and that from an
Icelandic saga.</p>

<p>Gr&iacute;mr was on the verge of marriage with Lopth&aelig;na,
but a week before the appointed day the bride was gone, and
nobody knew what had become of her. Her father had given her a
step-mother five years before, and the step-mother had been far
from kind; but what then? Gr&iacute;mr was restless and unhappy,
<a name="Page_I_293"/>
and got no tidings. A year of scarcity coming, he left home with
two of his people. After an adventure with four trolls, he had a
fight with twelve men, in which, though they were all slain, he
lost his comrades and was very badly wounded. As he lay on the
ground, looking only for death, a woman passed, if so she might
be called; for she was not taller than a child of seven years, so
stout that Gr&iacute;mr's arms would not go round her, misshapen,
bald, black, ugly, and disgusting in every particular. She came
up to Gr&iacute;mr, and asked him if he would accept his life
from her. "Hardly," said he, "you are so loathsome." But life was
precious, and he presently consented. She took him up and ran
with him, as if he were a babe, till she came to a large cave;
there she set him down, and it seemed to Gr&iacute;mr that she
was uglier than before. "Now pay me for saving your life," she
said, "and kiss me." "I cannot," said Gr&iacute;mr, "you look so
diabolical." "Expect no help, then, from me," said she, "and I
see that it will soon be all over with you." "Since it must be,
loath as I am," said Gr&iacute;mr, and went and kissed her; she
seemed not so bad to kiss as to look at. When night came she made
up a bed, and asked Gr&iacute;mr whether he would lie alone or
with her. "Alone," he answered. "Then," said she, "I shall take
no pains about healing your wounds." Gr&iacute;mr said he would
rather lie with her, if he had no other chance, and she bound up
his wounds, so that he seemed to feel no more of them. No sooner
was Gr&iacute;mr abed than he fell asleep, and when he woke, he
saw lying by him almost the fairest woman he had ever laid eyes
on, and marvellously like his true-love, Lopth&aelig;ma. At the
bedside he saw lying the troll-casing which she had worn; he
jumped up and burned this. The woman was very faint; he sprinkled
her with water, and she came to, and said, It is well for both of
us; I saved thy life first, and thou hast freed me from bondage.
It was indeed Lopth&aelig;ma, whom the step-mother had
transformed into a horrible shape, odious to men and trolls,
which she should never come out of till a man should consent to
three things, &mdash; which no man ever would, &mdash; to accept
his life at her hands, to kiss her, and to share her bed.

<p>Sir Frederic Madden, in his annotations upon this ballad, 'Syr
Gawayne,' p. 359, remarks that Sir Steven, stanza 31, does not
occur in the Round Table romances; that Sir Banier, 32, is
probably a mistake for Beduer, the king's constable; and that Sir
Bore and Sir Garrett, in the same stanza, are Sir Bors de Gauves,
brother of Lionel, and Gareth, or Gaheriet, the younger brother
of Gawain.</p>

<p>'The Marriage of Sir Gawaine,' as filled out by Percy from the
fragments in his manuscript, Reliques, 1765, III, 11, is
translated by Bodmer, I, 110; by Bothe, p. 75; by Knortz, Lieder
u. Romanzen Alt-Englands, p. 135.</p>
