<h3>190. Jamie Telfer of the Fair Dodhead</h3>


<p>P. 4. I am now able to give the unprinted copy, referred to in
the Border Minstrelsy, in which the Elliots take the place
assigned in the other version to the Scotts. This I do by the
assistance of Mr. Macmath, the present possessor of the
manuscript, which was formerly among the papers of Charles
Kirkpatrick Sharpe. The hand "is a good and careful one of about
the beginning of this century, with a slight shake in it, and
probably that of a person advanced in life." Be it observed that
the title, in this case, is 'Jamie Telfer in the Fair Dodhead,'
signifying, according to Scottish usage, that Telfer was tenant
simply, whereas 'of' would make him proprietor.</p>

<p>Hogg, writing to Sir W. Scott (Letters, vol. i, No 44), says
that 'Jamie Telfer,' as printed in the Minstrelsy, differs in
many particulars from his mother's way of giving it. Mrs. Hogg's
version may very likely have been a third copy.</p>

<p>In this version, Telfer, after the loosing of his nolt and the
ranshakling of his house, runs eight miles to Branxholm, to seek
aid of Buccleugh, who refers him to Martin Elliot, to whom, and
not to himself, Buccleugh affirms, Telfer has paid blackmail.
Telfer, as in the other version, runs up the water-gate to
Coultart Cleugh, and invokes the help of Jock Grieve, who sets
him on a bonny black to take the fray to Catlock Hill, as in the
other version again. Catlock Hill Mr. R.B. Armstrong considers to
be probably Catlie Hill, marked in Blaeu's map as near Braidlie.
It was occupied by an Elliot in 1541. At Catlock Hill Martin's
Hab sets Telfer on a bonny black to take the fray to
Prickenhaugh, a place which, Mr. Armstrong observes, is put in
Blaeu's map near Larriston. Auld Martin Elliot is at
Prickenhaugh, and he orders Simmy, his son, to be summoned, and
the water- side to be warned (including the Currers and Willie o
Gorrenberry, who in the other version, st. 27, are warned as
owing fealty to Scott; but an Archibald Eliot is described as "in
Gorrenberrie" in 1541,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_e19005_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and Will Elliot of Gorrombye was
concerned in the rescue of Kinmont Willie in 1596, Sim Elliot
takes the lead in the pursuit of the marauders which Willie Scott
has in the other version, and like him is killed. Martin Elliot
of Braidley had among his sons, in 1580, a Sym, an Arche, and a
Hob,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_e19005_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and was, during a portion of the second half of the
sixteenth century, says Mr. Armstrong, perhaps the most important
person of his name.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_e19005_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This Martin Elliot would fit very well
into our ballad, but that he should be described as of
Prickenhaugh, not of Braidley, raises a difficulty. Braidley, at
the junction of the Braidley burn with the Hermitage water, is
well placed for our purposes; Prickenhaugh, down by the Liddel
water, seems rather remote.</p>
