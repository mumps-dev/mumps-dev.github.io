<p>'Fair Mary of Wallington' was communicated to Bishop Percy,
with other "old Scots Songs," in 1775, by Roger Halt, and
presumably in a copy of the garland from which it is here
printed. A was given by Ritson, from an inferior edition, with
corrections, and the title changed to 'Fair Mabel of Wallington,'
in The Northumberland Garland, 1793, p. 38 of the reprint of
Northern Garlands, 1809. Ritson's copy is repeated in Bell's
Rhymes of Northern Bards, 1812, p. 147, and in Richardson's
Borderer's Table Book, VI, 141.</p>

<p>The story is very well preserved and very well told in
<b>A</b>. All the seven sisters of a family are destined to die
of their first child. Five having so died already, one of the
remaining two expresses a resolution never to marry, since she is
sure that she will go the way of the others. She is told that a
knight has been there, asking for her hand. Then in three
quarters of a year they may come to her burial. When her
husband's mother welcomes her to her castle and bowers, the bride
responds, under the operation of her melancholy conviction, I
think they'll soon be yours. At the end of three quarters of a
year she sends messages to her family: to her mother to come to
her sickening or her wake;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d091_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> to her sister to remain in
maidenhood, and escape the doom of the family. When the mother
arrives the young wife is in extremities.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d091_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> She gives rings to
her mother, who is all to blame, gives rings to her husband, and
with a razor opens her side, and takes out an heir for the house.
In <b>D</b> we are told that five boys had been cut from their
mothers, Mary's sisters, before. In <b>B</b> the remaining sister
declares that no man shall ever lie by her side; but her mother
says she shall marry though she live but three quarters of a
year: so, nearly, in <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>A Breton ballad, 'Pontplancoat,' <b>A</b>, Luzel, I, 382,
<b>B</b>, p. 386, exhibits such correspondences with the English
and Scottish that we cannot hesitate to assume that it has the
same source.</p>

<p>In the first version Pontplancoat marries Marguerite for his
third wife. He is obliged by affairs to leave her, and has a
dream which disturbs him so much that he returns home the same
night. This dream is that his wife has been three days in
travail, and it proves true. A spoon is put in the lady's mouth,
an incision made in her right side, and a son taken out. This is
Pontplancoat's third son, and each of them has been extracted
from his mother's side. He has had three wives of the name of
Marguerite, and they have all died in this way.</p>

<p>Marguerite, in the other version, is told by her mother that
she is to marry Pontplancoat. Marguerite signifies her obedience,
but Pontplancoat has already had four wives of her name, all of
whom "had been opened," and she shall be the fifth. As before,
Pontplancoat is obliged to go away, and during his absence he
receives letters which inform him that his wife is in labor and
that the chances are against a normal delivery. He returns
instantly. The lady has been three days in labor. A silver ball
is put into her mouth, her right side opened with a knife, and a
son extracted. Pontplancoat has four sons besides, all of whom
have been brought into the world in this way.</p>

<p>English <b>A</b> is localized in Northumberland, and Mary made
the wife of a Sir William Fenwick of Wallington. According to
notes of Percy, he had not been able to find a Sir William
Fenwick, lord of Wallington, with a wife of the name of Mary.
Were a Sir William and Lady Mary Fenwick authenticate, a nice
historical question would arise between them and some baron and
baroness of the family Pontplancoat in Finistere, Brittany.</p>

<p>An extensively disseminated Scandinavian ballad has been
assumed to be of kin with 'Mary of Wallington,' and in one
version or another has resemblances which may possibly come from
unity of origin, but the general likeness is certainly not
striking. The published texts are: <b>Norwegian</b>,
'Maalfr&iacute;,' Bugge, Gamle norske Folkeviser, p. 122, No 25,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. <b>Icelandic</b>,
'M&aacute;lfr&iacute;&eth;ar kv&aelig;&eth;i,' &Iacute;slenzk
furnkv&aelig;&eth;i, I, 208, No 24, <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>.
<b>Swedish</b>, 'Herr Peder och Malfred,' Afzelius, I, 70, No 14.
<b>Danish</b>, <b>A</b>, 'Esben og Malfred,' "Tragica, No 26,"
Danske Viser, III, 208, No 133; <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, Kristensen,
I, 232, No 87, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, 'Malfreds
D&oslash;d,' Kristensen, II, 232, No 69, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>;
<b>F</b>, 'Liden Malfreds Vise,' Feilberg, Fra Heden, p. 119;
<b>G</b>, 'Herr Peder og Liden Malfred,' Berggreen's Danske
Folkesange, 3d ed., p. 172, No 88. The Danish ballad is preserved
in ten manuscripts, and Grundtvig possessed not less than
twenty-two traditionary Danish versions and two Swedish, which he
did not live to print.</p>

<p>The Norwegian ballad is most like, or least unlike, the
English. Maalfr&iacute;, a king's only daughter, is married to
Karl, king of England. It was spaed to her when she was yet a
maid that she should die of her twelfth lying in; she has already
born eleven children. The king purposing to leave her for a time,
she reminds him of the prophecy. He defies spaewives and goes,
but after three days dreams that Maalfr&iacute;'s cloak is cut in
two, that her hair is cut to bits, etc.; and this sends him home,
When he learns that two sons have been cut from her side. He
throws himself on his sword. Maalfr&iacute;, Malfred, is, in the
other Norse ballads, also an only daughter, and dies in her
twelfth child-birth, in all but Icelandic <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, where the first is fatal to her. There are no other
important diversities, and the resemblances in the details of the
Norse and the English ballads are these two: the wife being fated
to die of her first child in Icelandic <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, and the C&aelig;sarean operation in the Norwegian
versions.</p>

<p>It is barely worth mentioning that there is also a German
ballad, in which a maid (only eleven years old in most of the
versions) begs her mother not to give her to a husband, because
she will not live more than a year if married, and dies
accordingly in child-birth: 'Hans Markgraf,' "Bothe,
Fr&uuml;hlings-Almanach, 1806, p. 132," reprinted in B&uuml;sching
und von der Hagen's Volkslieder, p. 30, Erlach, II, 136, Mittler,
No 133; "Alle bei Gott die sich lieben," Wunderhorn, 1808, II,
250, Erlach, IV, 127, Mittler, No 128; Hoffmann und Richter,
Schlesische Volkslieder, p. 12, No 5, Mittler, No 132. To these
may be added 'Der Graf und die Bauerntochter,' Ditfurth, II, 8,
No 9; 'Der Mutter Fluch,' Meinert, p. 246. In these last it is
the mother who objects to the marriage, on account of her
daughter's extreme youth.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d091_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
