<h3>17. Hind Horn</h3>


<p>P. 193 (2). 'Hr. Lovmand' in Kristensen's Skattegraveren,
VIII, 49, No 115.</p>

<p>194 ff., 502 f., II, 499 b.</p>

<p>According to a Devonshire tradition given by Mrs. Bray,
Traditions of Devonshire, II, 172 (II, 32, of the new ed. of
1879, which has a fresh title, The Borders of the Tamar and the
Tavy), Sir Francis Drake, having been abroad seven years, was
apprised by one of his devils that his wife was about to marry
again. He immediately discharged one of his great guns up through
the earth. The cannon-ball "fell with a loud explosion between
the lady and her intended bridegroom," who were before the altar.
In another version, known to Southey and communicated by him to
Mrs. Bray (as above, II, 174; new ed., II, 33, 34), the marriage
is broken off by a large stone (no doubt a gun-stone) which falls
on the lady's train as she is on her way to church. Drake, in
this version, returns in disguise, but is recognized by his
smile. See for various stories of the same kind, 'Iouenn
Kerm&eacute;nou,' Luzel, Contes pop. de Basse-Bretagne, I, 416;
'Der todte Schuldner,' Zingerle, Zeitschrift f&uuml;r deutsche
Mythologie, II, 367; 'De witte Sw&acirc;ne,' Woeste, the same,
III, 46, translated from the Markish dialect by Simrock, 'Der
gute Gerhard,' u.s.w., p. 75; Vernaleken, Mythen u. Brauche des
Volkes in Oesterreich, p. 372; Vernaleken, Kinder- u.
Hausm&auml;rchen, No 54, p. 315 f.; J.H. Knowles, Folk-Tales of
Kashmir, p. 184 f.; Prym u. Socin, Syrische Sagen u.
M&auml;rchen, No 20, II, 72. (G.L.K.)</p>

<p>Pp. 198 b, 502 b, II, 499 b. An Italian form of 'Le 
Retour du Mari' is 'Il Ritorno del Soldato,' Nigra, No 
28b, p. 174.</p>

<p>Another Italian ballad has some of the points in the story of
Horn. A man goes off for seven years immediately after marriage;
the woman looking out towards the sea perceives a pilgrim
approaching; he asks for charity, and makes what seems an
impudent suggestion, for which she threatens him with punishment.
But how if I were your husband? Then you would give me some
token. He pulls out his wedding-ring from under his cloak. 'II
finto [falso] Pellegrino,' Bernoni, ix, no 7, Ferraro, C. p.
monferrini, p. 33, Giannini, p. 151 (nearly the same in Archivio,
VI, 361); 'La Moglie fedele,' Wolf, p. 59, No 81, Ive, p. 334;
'Bennardo,' Nerucci, in Archivio, III, 44.</p>

<p>To the Portuguese ballads, I, 502 b, add 'A bella Infanta,'
Bellermann, p. 100.</p>

<p>Add to the Polish ballads, p. 502 b: Roger, p. 13, Nos 25,
26.</p>

<p>With the Slavic ballads belong: Servian, Vuk, III, No 25;
Bulgarian, Miladinof, Nos 65, 66, 111, 573, Ka&#269;anovskiy, Nos
68-73, 112. (W.W.)</p>

<p>202 a. The three singing laverocks in <b>B</b> 3, <b>F</b> 4,
(cf. <b>A</b> 3,) are to be taken as curiosities of art.
Artificial singing-birds are often mentioned in the earlier
times, (by Sir John Mandeville for instance): see Liebrecht,
Volkskunde, p. 89 f., No 5. Such birds, and artificially hissing
snakes, occur in the Great-Russian bylina of Djuk
Stepanovi&#263;; cf. Wollner, Untersuchungen &uuml;. d. grossr.
Volksepik, p. 134 f. (W.W.)</p>

<p>205. <b>G</b> would have been printed as it stands in Kinloch
Manuscripts VII, 117, had the volume been in my possession. The
copy principally used in Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads, p.
138, was derived from the editor's niece, M. Kinnear. Readings of
another copy are written in pencil over the transcript of the
first in places, and as the name "Christy Smith" is also written
at the beginning in pencil, it may be supposed that these
readings were furnished by this Christy Smith. Kinloch adopted
some of these readings into the copy which appears in his book,
and he introduced others which seem to be his own. The readings
of the Kinnear copy not retained by Kinloch will now be given
under <b>a</b>, and those supplied (as may be supposed) by
Christy Smith under <b>b</b>.</p>
