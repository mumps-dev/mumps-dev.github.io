<p>The Protector Somerset, to overcome or to punish the
opposition of the Scots to the marriage of Mary Stuart with
Edward VI, invaded Scotland at the end of the summer of 1547 with
eighteen thousand men, supported by a fleet. The Scots mustered
at Musselburgh, a town on the water five or six miles east of
Edinburgh, under the Earls of Arran, Angus, and Huntly, each of
whom, according to Buchanan, had ten thousand men, and there the
issue was tried on the 10th of September. The northern army
abandoned an impregnable position, and their superior, but
ill-managed, and partly ill-composed, force, after successfully
resisting a cavalry charge, was put to flight by the English, who
had an advantage in cannon and cavalry as well as generalship. A
hideous slaughter followed; Leslie admits that, in the chase and
battle, there were slain above ten thousand of his countrymen.
Patten, a Londoner who saw and described the fight, says that the
one anxiety of the Scots was lest the English should get away,
and that they were so sure of victory that, the night before the
battle, they fell "to playing at dice for certain of our noblemen
and captains of fame" (cf. stanza 3), as the French diced for
prisoners on the eve of Agincourt. The dates are wrong in
1<sup>1,2</sup>, 5<sup>1</sup>; Huntly is rightly said to have
been made prisoner, 7<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>6, 8. When the Scots were once turned, says Patten, "it was a
wonder to see how soon and in how sundry sorts they were
scattered; the place they stood on like a wood of staves, strewed
on the ground as rushes in a chamber, unpassable, they lay so
thick, for either horse or man." Some made their course along the
sands by the Frith, towards Leith; some straight toward
Edinburgh; "and the residue, and (as we noted then) the most, of
them toward Dalkeith, which way, by means of the marsh, our
horsemen were worst able to follow."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d172_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The battle is known also by the name of Pinkie or Pinkie
Clench, appellations of an estate, a burn and a hill ("a hill
called Pinkincleuche," Leslie), near or within the field of
operations.</p>

<p>Percy remarks upon 3<sup>3</sup>: "It should seem from hence
that there was somewhat of a uniform among our soldiers even
then." There are jackets white and red in No 166, 29<sup>3</sup>.
Sir William Stanley has ten thousand red coats at his order in
'Lady Bessy,' vv 593, 809-11, 937 f, Percy Manuscript, III, 344,
352, 358; Sir John Savage has fifteen hundred white hoods in the
same piece, v. 815.</p>
