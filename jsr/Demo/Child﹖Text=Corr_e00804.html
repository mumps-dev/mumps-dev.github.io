<h3>8. Erlinton</h3>


<p>P. 107. The two copies from which (with some editorial garnish
and filling out) <b>A</b> was compounded were: <b>a</b>. "Scotch
Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy," No 20, obtained from
Nelly Laidlaw, and in the handwriting of William Laidlaw;
<b>b</b>. 'Earlington's Daughter,' the same collection, No 11, in
the handwriting of James Hogg. The differences are purely verbal,
and both copies may probably have been derived from the same
reciter; still, since only seven or eight verses in sixty-eight
agree, both will be given entire, instead of a list of the
variations.</p>
