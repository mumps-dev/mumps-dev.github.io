<i>which Motherwell had heard related, and of which he gives
a specimen at p. xv. of his Introduction:</i>
"Well, ye must know that in the Moor's castle there was a
massymore, which is a dark dungeon for keeping prisoners. It was
twenty feet below the ground, and into this hole they closed poor
Beichan. There he stood, night and day, up to his waist in puddle
water; but night or day it was all one to him, for no ae styme of
light ever got in. So he lay there a lang and weary while, and
thinking on his heavy weird, he made a murnfu sang to pass the
time, and this was the sang that he made, and grat when he sang
it, for he never thought of ever escaping from the massymore, or
of seeing his ain country again:<br/>
<br/>
'My hounds they all run masterless,<br/>
My hawks they flee from tree to tree;<br/>
My youngest brother will heir my lands,<br/>
And fair England again I'll never see.<br/>
<br/>
'Oh were I free as I hae been,<br/>
And my ship swimming once more on sea,<br/>
I'd turn my face to fair England,<br/>
And sail no more to a strange countrie.'<br/>
<br/>
"Now the cruel Moor had a beautiful daughter, called Susy Pye,
who was accustomed to take a walk every morning in her garden,
and as she was walking ae day she heard the songh o Beichan's
sang, coming as it were from below the ground," etc.,
