<h3>Robin Hood and Maid Marian</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Wood, 401, leaf 21 b. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d15001.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Ritson, Robin Hood, 1795, II, 157, from Wood's copy. In none
of the garlands.</p>

<p>The Earl of Huntington, alias Robin Hood, is forced by
fortune's spite to part from his love Marian, and take to the
green wood. Marian dresses herself "like a page," and, armed with
bow, sword, and buckler, goes in quest of Robin. Both being
disguised, neither recognizes the other until they have had an
hour at swords, when Robin Hood, who has lost some blood, calls
to his antagonist to give over and join his band. Marian knows
his voice, and discovers herself. A banquet follows, and Marian
remains in the wood.</p>

<p>Though Maid Marian and Robin Hood had perhaps been paired in
popular sports, no one thought of putting more of her than her
name into a ballad, until one S.S. (so the broadside is signed)
composed this foolish ditty. The bare name of Maid Marian occurs
in No 145 A, 9<sup>4</sup> and in No 147, 1<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<p>Even in Barclay's fourth eclogue, written not long after 1500,
where, according to Ritson,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d150_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> the earliest notice of Maid
Marian occurs, and where, he says, "she is evidently connected
with Robin Hood," the two are really kept distinct; for the lusty
Codrus in that eclogue wishes to hear "some mery fit of Maide
Marion, or els of Robin Hood."</p>

<p>In Munday's play of The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntington,
Matilda, otherwise Marian, daughter to Lord Lacy, accompanies
Earl Robert to Sherwood, upon his being outlawed for debt the
very day of their trothplight. There she lives a spotless maiden,
awaiting the time when the outlawry shall be repealed and Robin
may legally take her to wife. Neither the author of the play nor
that of the ballad was, so far as is known, repeating any popular
tradition.</p>

<p>The ordinary partner of Maid Marian is Friar Tuck, not Robin
Hood. There is no ground for supposing that there ever were songs
or tales about the Maid and Friar, notwithstanding what is
cursorily said by one of the characters in Peele's Edward I:</p>
