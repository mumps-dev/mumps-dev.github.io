<h3>Christopher White</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Christopher White,' Percy Manuscript, p. 513;
Hales and Furnivall, III, 494. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d10801.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>A rich merchant, burgess of Edinburgh, overhears a lady making
moan for Christopher White, who is banished from England. He
makes her great offers to abandon Christopher and lay her love on
him. She resists these offers at first, and tells him that if she
is false to Christopher she cannot be true to him. But silver and
gold makes her heart turn and makes her leave good company. After
she has been married two or three months tidings come to
Edinburgh that all the merchants must to sea; it is for service
against Spain, 17<sup>4</sup>. The lady takes advantage of her
husband's absence to write to Christopher; she sends him a
hundred pound and bids him come to Edinburgh. Christopher first
goes to London and obtains pardon of the king of England, then
makes for Edinburgh. The lady tells him that she is a merchant's
wife, and he shall have enough of the merchant's gold.
Christopher, who seems not till then to have known of her
marriage, begins an indignant answer, but the lady cuts him short
with an offer to go to England with him. They pack up silver and
gold and make off to Little England, whatever that may be
(perhaps a Percy Manuscript phrase: see 'Hugh Spencer,' st. 34).
The merchant comes back, and is told that his wife has fled with
Christopher. He does not care for the loss of silver and gold,
but mourns for the lady, who, he frankly owns, had given him due
warning of what he might look for.</p>
