<h3>Dugal Quin</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Dugall Quin,' The Old Lady's Manuscript Collection, No 27. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d29401.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>In this little ballad, which has barely story enough to be so
called, Dugald Quin, a Highlander, who seems to give himself out
as a man in very humble circumstances, induces Lizzie Menzies, a
young lady who appears to have nine maids at her command, to
follow him, regardless of her father's opposition. She cannot
resist his merry winking eyes. After she has cast in her lot with
his, he promises her nine mills (to match the nine maids), and to
make her lady of Garlogie. The old lady minutes at the end of her
copy that "it was the Marquis of Huntly."</p>

<p>One version of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_225.html">Rob Roy</a>,' No 225, I, 8, has 
a stanza like 2.</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>

But and my twinkling een, lady,<br/>
A little bonnet on my head,<br/>
And cocket up aboon, lady?'</td></tr>

<p>I suppose the Farie of 6<sup>2</sup>, 9<sup>2</sup>, to stand
for a locality on the waycaorth to Boggie (Strathbogie); I
cannot, however, identify the place. 'Tempeng chiss of farie,'
6<sup>4</sup>, 9<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup>, may be a tempting
fairy treasure. 'Chis' is Gaelic for tribute, but I am at present
unable, making whatever allowance for the capricious spelling of
the manuscript, to suggest any satisfying explanation of this
important phrase.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott makes this note: "How the devil came Dugald
Gunn [so he chooses to read Quin] to be identified with the
Marquis of Huntly? I never saw the song before; it has some spunk
in it." Sharpe's Ballad Book, ed. 1880, p. 154.</p>
