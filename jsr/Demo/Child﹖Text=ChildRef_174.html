<h3>Earl Bothwell</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Earle Bodwell,' Percy Manuscript, p. 272;
Hales and Furnivall, II, 260. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d17401.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Printed in Percy's Reliques, with changes, 1765, II, 197, 'The
Murder of the King of Scots;' with some restorations of the
original readings, 1794, II, 200.</p>

<p>This ballad represents, 8, 13, that the murder of Darnley was
done in revenge for his complicity in the murder of Riccio; in
which there may be as much truth as this, that the queen's
resentment of Darnley's participation in that horrible
transaction may have been operative in inducing her assent such
assent as she gave to the conspiracy against the life of her
husband.</p>

<p>2. Darnley came to Scotland in February, 1565 (being then but
just turned of nineteen), not sent for, but very possibly with
some hope of pleasing his cousin, 'the queen [dowager] of
France,' to whom he was married in the following July. His
inglorious career was closed in February, 1567.</p>

<p>5. On the fatal evening of the ninth of March, 1566, Riccio
was sitting in the queen's cabinet with his cap on; "and this
sight was perhaps the more offensive that a few Scotsmen of good
rank seem to have been in attendance as domestics."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d174_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>6. The ballad should not be greatly in excess as to the number
of the daggers, since Riccio had fifty-six [fifty-two] wounds.</p>

<p>7. After Riccio had been dragged out of the queen's cabinet,
Darnley fell to charging the queen with change in her ways with
him since "yon fellow Davie fell in credit and familiarity" with
her. In answer to his reproaches and interpellations her Majesty
said to him that he was to blame for all the shame that was done
to her; "for the which I shall never be your wife nor lie with
you, nor shall never like well till I gar you have as sore a
heart as I have presently."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d174_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>9-14. A large quantity of powder was fired in the room below
that in which "the worthy king" slept, but the body of Darnley and
that of his servant were found lying at a considerable distance
from the house, without any marks of having been subject to the
explosion. One theory of the circumstances was that the two had
been strangled in their beds, and removed before the train was
lighted, another account is that Darnley, who would naturally
hear some stir in the house, made his escape with his page, but
"was intercepted and strangled after a desperate resistance, his
cries for mercy being heard by some women in the nearest
house."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d174_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Bothwell, though the author of all these proceedings
and personally superintending the execution of them, did not
openly appear.</p>

<p>It will be observed that King James says that his father
[Manuscript mother] was hanged on a tree, in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_180.html">King James and Brown</a>,'
No 180, 8<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Bothwell and Huntly, who by virtue of their offices had
apartments in the palace, not being in sympathy with the
conspirators, are said in the Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 90, to
have broken through a window, in fear of their lives, and to have
let themselves down by a cord. Bothwell, as the champion of the
queen against the confederate lords, might naturally be supposed
by the minstrel to take a personal interest in revenging
Riccio.</p>

<p>15, 16. The Regent Murray is here described as 'bitterly
banishing' Mary, wherefore she durst not remain in Scotland, but
fled to England. The queen escaped from Lochleven Castle on the
second of May, 1568, and took refuge in England on the sixteenth.
We must suppose the ballad to have been made not long after.</p>

Reliques.</p>
