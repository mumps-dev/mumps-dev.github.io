<h3>Child Owlet</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Childe Owlet,' Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I,
27; Motherwell's Manuscript, p. 572. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d29101.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Lady Erskine invites Child Owlet to be her paramour. Child
Owlet revolts at the suggestion; he is sister's son to Lord
Ronald. The lady cuts herself with a penknife sufficiently to
draw blood; Lord Ronald hears her moaning, comes in, and asks
what blood this is; his wife gives him to understand that Child
Owlet has offered her violence. A council is held upon the case,
and the youth is condemned to be torn by four horses. There was
not a twig or a rush on the moor that was not dropping with his
blood.</p>

<p>The chain of gold in the first stanza and the penknife below
the bed in the fourth have a false ring, and the story is of the
tritest. The ballad seems at best to be a late one, and is
perhaps mere imitation, but, for an imitation, the last two
stanzas are unusually successful.</p>
