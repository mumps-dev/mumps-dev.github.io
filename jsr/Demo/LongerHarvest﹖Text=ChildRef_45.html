printed for P. Brooksby. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d04502.html"><i>Version B</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>The broadside <b>B</b> was printed, with trifling variations,
or corrections, in Pills to purge Melancholy, IV, 29 (1719), and
in Old Ballads, II, 49 (1723). It is found in several of the
collections: Pepys, II, 128, No 112; Roxburghe, III, 883; Ouvry,
No 47; the Bagford; and it was among Heber's ballads. Brooksby
published from 1672 to 1695, and <b>B</b> was "allowed" by Roger
l'Estrange, who was licenser from 1663 to 1685: Chappell, The
Roxburghe Ballads, I, xviii, xxiii. The title of <b>B</b> is A
<i>new</i> ballad of King John and the Abbot of Canterbury, to
the tune of 'The King and the Lord Abbot.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d045_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This older ballad
seems not to have come down.</p>

<p>There are at least two other broadsides
<a name="Page_I_404"/>
extant upon the same
subject, both mentioned by Percy, and both inferior even to
<b>B</b>, and in a far less popular style: 'The King and the
Bishop,' Pepys, I, 472, No 243, Roxburghe, III, 170, Douce, fol.
110; and 'The Old Abbot and King Olfrey,' Douce, II, fol. 169,
Pepys, II, 127, No 111, printed in Old Ballads, II, 55.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d045_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In
both of these the Shepherd is the Bishop's brother, which he is
not in <b>B</b>; in <b>A</b> he is half-brother. Pepys's Penny
Merriments contain, I, 14, 'The pleasant History of King Henry
the Eighth and the Abbot of Reading.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d045_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This last may, without
rashness, be assumed to be a variation of 'King John and the
Abbot.'</p>

<p>Percy admitted 'King John and the Abbot' to his Reliques, II,
302, introducing many lines from <b>A</b> "worth reviving," and
many improvements of his own,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d045_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and thus making undeniably a
very good ballad out of a very poor one.</p>

<p>The story of this ballad was told in Scotland, some fifty years
ago, of the Gudeman of Ballengeigh, James the V, the hero of not
a few other tales. Once on a time, falling in with the priest of
Markinch (near Falkland), and finding him a dullard, he gave the
poor man four questions to think of till they next met, with an
intimation that his benefice would be lost were they not rightly
answered. The questions were those of our ballad, preceded by
Where is the middle of the earth? The parson could make nothing
of them, and was forced to resort to a miller of the
neighborhood, who was reputed a clever fellow. When called to
answer the first question, the miller put out his staff, and
said, There, as your majesty will find by measuring. The others
were dealt with as in the ballad. The king said that the miller
should have the parson's place, but the miller begged off from
this in favor of the incumbent. Small, Interesting Roman
Antiquities recently discovered in Fife, p. 289 ff.</p>

<p>Riddle stories in which a forfeit is to be paid by a vanquished
party have incidentally been referred to under No 1 and No 2.
They are a very extensive class. The oldest exampIe is that of
Samson's riddle, with a stake of thirty sheets (or shirts) and
thirty change of garments: Judges, xiv, 12 ff. Another from
Semitic tradition is what is related of Solomon and Hiram of
Tyre, in Josephus against Apion, i, 17, 18, and Antiquities,
viii, 5. After the manner of Amasis and the &AElig;thiopian king
in Plutarch (see p. 13), they send one another riddles, with a
heavy fine for failure, &mdash; in this case a pecuniary one.
Solomon at first poses Hiram; then Hiram guesses Solomon's
riddles, by the aid of Abdemon (or the son of Abdemon), and in
turn poses Solomon with riddles devised by Abdemon.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d045_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>'P&aacute; gr&ouml;nali&eth;hei&eth;i,' Landstad, p. 369, is a
contest in riddles between two brothers (refreshingly original in
some parts), introduced by three stanzas, in which it is agreed
that the defeated party shall forfeit his share of their
inheritance: and this the editor seems to take quite
seriously.</p>

<p>Death is the penalty attending defeat in many of these
wit-contests. Odin (Vaf&thorn;ru&eth;nism&aacute;l), jealous of
the giant Vaf&thorn;r&uacute;&eth;nir's wisdom, wishes to put it
to test. He enters the giant's hall, assuming the name of
<a name="Page_I_405"/>
Gagnr&aacute;&eth;r, and announces the object of his visit. The
giant tells him he shall never go out again unless he prove the
wiser, asks a few questions to see whether he be worth contending
with, and, finding him so, proposes a decisive trial, with their
heads for the stake. Odin now propounds, first, twelve questions,
mostly in cosmogony, and then five relating to the future of the
universe; and all these the giant is perfectly competent to
answer. The very unfair question is then put, What did Odin say
in his son's ear ere Balder mounted the funeral pile? Upon this
Vaf&thorn;r&ucirc;&eth;nir owns himself vanquished, and we may be
sure he was not spared by his antagonist.</p>

<p>The Hervarar saga contains a story which, in its outlines,
approximates to that of our ballad until we come to the
conclusion, where there is no likeness. King Hei&eth;rekr, after a
long career of blood, gave up war and took to law-making. He
chose his twelve wisest men for judges, and swore, with one hand
on the head and the other on the bristles of a huge hog which he
had reared, that no man should do such things that he should not
get justice from these twelve, while anyone who preferred might
clear himself by giving the king riddles which he could not
guess. There was a man named Gestr, and surnamed the Blind, a
very bad and troublesome fellow, who had withheld from
Hei&eth;rekr tribute that was due. The king sent him word to come
to him and submit to the judgment of the twelve: if he did not,
the case would be tried with arms. Neither of these courses
pleased Gestr, who was conscious of being very guilty: he took
the resolution of making offerings to Odin for help. One night
there was a knock. Gestr went to the door, and saw a man, who
announced his name as Gestr. After mutual inquiries about the
news, the stranger asked whether Gestr the Blind was not in
trouble about something. Gestr the Blind explained his plight
fully, and the stranger said, "I will go to the king and try what
I can effect: we will exchange looks and clothes." The stranger,
in the guise of Gestr, entered the king's hall, and said, Sire, I
am come to make my peace. "Will you abide by the judgment of my
men of law? " asked the king. "Are there not other ways?"
inquired Gestr. "Yes: you shall give me riddles which I cannot
guess, and so purchase your peace." Gestr assented, with feigned
hesitation; chairs were brought, and everybody looked to hear
something fine. Gestr gave, and Hei&eth;rekr promptly answered,
some thirty riddles.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d045_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Then said Gestr: Tell thou me this
only, since thou thinkest to be wiser than all kings: What said
Odin in Balder's ear before he was borne to the pile? "Shame and
cowardice," exclaimed Hei&eth;rekr, "and all manner of
poltroonery, jugglery, goblinry! no one knows those words of
thine save thou thyself, evil and wretched wight!" So saying,
Hei&eth;rekr drew Tyrfing, that never was bared but somebody must
fall, to cut down Gestr. The disguised Odin changed to a hawk,
and made for the window, but did not escape before Hei&eth;rekr's
sword had docked the bird's tail. For breaking his own truce Odin
said Hei&eth;rekr should die by the hand of a slave, which came to
pass. Fornaldar S&ouml;gur, Rafn, I, 462 ff.</p>

<p>The same story has come down in a F&auml;r&ouml;e ba11ad,
'G&aacute;tu r&iacute;ma,' Hammershaimb, F&aelig;r&ouml;iske
Kv&aelig;der, No 4, p. 26 (and previously published in the
Antiquarisk Tidsskrift, 1849-51, pp 75-78), translated by Dr.
Prior, I, 336 ff. Gest promises Odin twelve gold marks to take
his place. The riddles are announced as thirteen in number, but
the ballad is slightly defective, and among others the last
question, What were Odin's words to Balder? is lost. Odin flies
off in the shape of a falcon; Hejdrek and all his men are burned
up.</p>

<p>A tale presenting the essential traits of our ballad is cited
in Vincent of Beauvais's Speculum Morale, i, 4, 10, at the end.
"We read, he says, of a king, who, seeking a handle for wrenching
money out of a wealthy and wise man, put him three questions,
apparently
<a name="Page_I_406"/>
insoluble, intending to make him pay a large sum for
not answering them: 1, Where is the middle point of the earth? 2,
How much water is there in the sea? 3, How great is the mercy of
God? On the appointed day, having been brought from prison into
the presence to ransom himself if he could, the respondent, by
the advice of a certain philosopher, proceeded thus. He planted
his staff where he stood, and said, Here is the centre; disprove
it if you can. If you wish me to measure the sea, stop the
rivers, so that nothing may flow in till I have done; then I will
give you the contents. To answer your third question, I must
borrow your robes and your throne. Then mounting the throne,
clothed with the royal insignia, "Behold," said he, "the height
of the mercy of God: but now I was a slave, now I am a king; but
now poor, and now rich; but now in prison and in chains, and now
at liberty," etc.</p>

<p>Of the same stamp is a story in the English Gesta Romanorum,
Madden, p. 55, No 19. A knight was accused to the emperor by his
enemies, but not so as to give a plausible ground for steps
against him. The emperor could hit upon no way but to put him
questions, on pain of life and death. The questions were seven;
the third and the sixth will suffice: How many gallons of salt
water been in the sea? Answer: Let all the outpassings of fresh
water be stopped, and I shall tell thee. How many days' journey
beth in the circle of the world? Answer: Only the space of one
day.</p>

<p>Much nearer to the ballad, and earlier than either of the
preceding, is the Stricker's tale of &Acirc;m&icirc;s and the
Bishop, in the Pfaffe &Acirc;m&icirc;s, dated at about 1236.
AmIs, a learned and bountiful priest in England, excited the envy
of his bishop, who sent for him, told him that he lived in better
style than his superior, and demanded a subvention. The priest
flatly refused to give the bishop anything but a good dinner.
"Then you shall lose your church," said the bishop in wrath. But
the priest, strong in a good conscience, felt small concern about
that: he said the bishop might test his fitness with any
examination he pleased. That I will do, said the bishop, and gave
him five questions. "How much is there in the sea?" "One tun,"
answered &Acirc;m&icirc;s; "and if you think I am not right, stop
all the rivers that flow in, and I will measure it and convince
you." "Let the rivers run," said the bishop. "How many days from
Adam to our time?" "Seven," said the parson; " for as soon as
seven are gone, they begin again." The bishop, fast losing his
temper, next demanded "What is the exact middle of the earth?
Tell me, or lose your church." "Why, my church stands on it,"
replied &Acirc;m&icirc;s. "Let your men measure, and take the
church if it prove not so." The bishop declined the task, and
asked once more: How far is it from earth to sky? and then: What
is the width of the sky? to which &Acirc;m&icirc;s replied after
the same fashion.</p>

<p>In this tale of the Stricker the parson answers for himself,
and not by deputy, and none of the questions are those of our
ballad. But in a tale of Franco Sacchetti,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d045_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> given in two
forms, Novella iv<sup>a</sup>, we have both the abbot and his
humble representative, and an agreement as to one of the
questions. Bernab&ograve; Visconti (&#8224; 1385) was offended
with a rich abbot, who had neglected some dogs that had been
entrusted to his care, and was minded to make the abbot pay him a
fine; but so far yielded to the abbot's protest as to promise to
release him from all penalties if he could answer four questions:
How far is it from here to heaven? How much water is there in the
sea? What is going on in hell? What is the value of my person? A
day was given to get up the answers. The abbot went home, in the
depths of melancholy, and met on the way one of his millers, who
inquired what was the matter, and, after receiving an
explanation, offered to take the abbot's place, disguising
himself as well as he could. The answers to the two first
questions are not the usual ones: huge numbers are given, and the
seigneur is told to measure for himself, if not willing to accept
them. The answer to the fourth is twenty-nine deniers; for our
Lord was sold for thirty,
<a name="Page_I_407"/>
and you must be worth one less than he.
Messer Bernab&ograve; said the miller should be abbot, and the
abbot miller, from that time forth. Sacchetti says that others
tell the story of a pope and an abbot, adding one question. The
gardener of the monastery presents the abbot, makes the usual
answer to the second question as to the water in the sea, and
prizes Christ's vicar at twenty-eight deniers.</p>

<p>The excellent old farce, "Ein Spil von einem Kaiser und eim
Apt," Fastnachtspiele aus dem 15<sup>n</sup> Jahrhundert, I, 199,
No 22, obliges the abbot to answer three questions, or pay for
all the damages done in the course of a calamitous invasion. The
abbot has a week's grace allowed him. The questions are three:
How much water in the sea? How much is the emperor worth? Whose
luck came quickest? The miller answers for the abbot: Three tubs,
if they are big enough; eight and twenty pence; and he is the man
whose luck came quickest, for just before he was a miller, now he
is an abbot. The emperor says that, since the miller has acted
for the abbot, abbot he shall be.</p>

<p>Very like this, as to the form of the story, is the anecdote in
Pauli's Schimpf und Ernst, LV, p. 46, ed. Oesterley (c. 1522). A
nobleman, who is seeking an occasion to quarrel with an abbot,
tells him that he must answer these questions in three days, or
be deposed: What do you value me at? Where is the middle of the
world? How far apart are good and bad luck? A swineherd answers
for him: Since Christ was sold for thirty pence, I rate the
emperor at twenty-nine and you at twenty-eight; my church is the
mid-point of the world, and, if you will not believe me, measure
for yourself; good and bad luck are but one night apart, for
yesterday I was a swineherd, to-day I am an abbot. Then, says the
nobleman, an abbot shall you stay. With this agrees, say the
Grimms, the tale in Eyring's Proverbiorum Copia (1601), I,
165-168, III, 23-25.</p>

<p>Waldis, Esopus (1548), B. 3, Fabel 92, Kurz, I, 382, agrees in
general with Pauli: but in place of the first two questions has
these three: How far is to heaven? How deep is the sea? How many
tubs will hold all the sea-water? The answers are: A short day's
journey, for Christ ascended in the morning and was in heaven
before night; a stone's cast; one tub, if large enough.</p>

<p>Teofilo Folengo (1491-1544), as pointed out by K&ouml;hler,
has the story in the 8th canto of his Orlandino; and here we find
the third question of our ballad. There are three besides: How far
from earth to heaven? From the east to the west? &mdash; a
modification of the second question in the ballad; How many drops
of water in the seas about Italy? The abbot's cook, Marcolf,
answers to the first, One leap, as proved by Satan's fall; to the
second, One day's journey, if the sun is to be trusted; and
insists that, for a correct count under the third, all the rivers
shall first be stopped. To the fourth he makes the never-stale
reply, You <i>think</i> I am the abbot, but I am the cook.
Rainero says he shall remain abbot, and the abbot the cook.
(Stanzas 38, 39, 64-69, pp 186 f, 195 ff, London edition of
1775.)</p>

<p>A capital Spanish story, 'Gramatica Parda, Trueba, Cuentos
Populares, p. 287, has all three of the questions asked and
answered as in our ballad. There is a curate who sets up to know
everything, and the king, "el rey que rabi&oacute;," has found
him out, and gives him a month to make his three answers, with a
premium and a penalty. The curate is forced to call in a despised
goatherd, who also had all along seen through the shallowness of
the priest. The king makes the goatherd "archip&aacute;mpano " of
Seville, and condemns the curate to wear the herdsman's garb and
tend his goats for a month.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d045_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The first and third questions of the ballad are found in the
thirty-eighth tale of Le Grand Parangon des Nouvelles Nouvelles
of Nicolas de Troyes, 1536 (ed. Mabille, p. 155 ff); in
<a name="Page_I_408"/>
the
Patra&ntilde;uelo of Juan de Timoneda, 1576, Pat. 14, Novelistas
anteriores &aacute; Cervantes, in the Rivadeneyra Biblioteca, p.
154 f; and in the Herzog Heinrich Julius von Braunschweig's
comedy, Von einem Edelman welcher einem Abt drey Fragen
auffgegeben, 1594, ed. Holland, p. 500 ff. The other question is
as to the centre of the earth, and the usual answers are given by
the abbot's miller, cook, servant, except that in Timoneda the
cook is so rational as to say that the centre must be under the
king's feet, seeing that the world is as round as a ball.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d045_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
The question Where is the middle of the earth? is replaced by How
many stars are there in the sky? the other two remaining, in
Balthasar Schupp, Schriften, Franckfurt, 1701, I, 91 f
(K&ouml;hler), and in Gottlieb Cober (&#8224; 1717),
Cabinet-prediger, 2<sup>r</sup> Theil, No 65, p. 323
(Gr&auml;ter, Idunna u. Hermode, 1814, No 33, p. 131, and p. 87).
The abbot's miller gives a huge number, and bids the king (of
France) verify it, if he wishes. This last is no doubt the
version of the story referred to by the Grimms in their note to
K. u. H. m&auml;rchen, No 152.</p>

<p>We encounter a slight variation, not for the better, in
L'&Eacute;lite des Contes du Sieur d'Ouville (&#8224; 1656 or
1(57), Rouen, 1699, I, 241; &agrave; la Haye, 1703, I, 296; ed.
Ristelhuber, 1876, p. 46 (K&ouml;hler); Nouveaux Contes &agrave;
Rire, Cologne, 1709, p. 266; Contes &agrave; Rire, Paris, 1781,
I, 184. An ignorant and violent nobleman threatens a parson, who
plumes himself on a little astrology, that he will expose him as
an impostor if he does not answer four questions: Where is the
middle of the world? What am I worth? What am I thinking? What do
I believe? The village miller answers for the cur&eacute;. The
reply to the third question is, You are thinking more of your own
interest than of mine; the others as before. This story is
retold, after tradition, by C&eacute;nac Moncaut, Contes
populaires de la Gascogne, p. 50, of a marquis,
archipr&ecirc;tre, and miller. The query, What am I thinking of?
with the answer, More of your interest than of mine (which is not
exactly in the popular manner), is replaced by a logical puzzle,
not found elsewhere: Quel est le nombre qui se trouve

<p>The King and the Abbot is preserved, in modern German
tradition, in this form. An emperor, riding by a cloister, reads
the inscription, We are two farthings poorer than the emperor, and
live free of cares. Wait a bit, says the emperor, and I will give
you some cares. He sends for the abbot, and says, Answer these
three questions in three days, or I will depose you. The
questions are, How deep is the sea? How many stars in the sky?
How far from good luck to bad? The shepherd of the monastery
gives the answers, and is told, as in several cases before, If
you are the abbot, abbot you shall be. J.W. Wolf, Hessische
Sagen, p. 166, No 262, II. 'Gustav Adolf und der Abt von
Benediktbeuern,' in Sepp's Altbayerischer Sagenschatz, p. 554, No
153, is another form of the same story, with a substitution of
How far is it to heaven? for the first question, and the answers
are given by a kitchie-boy.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d045_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In 'Hans ohne Sorgen,' Meier,
Deutsche Volksm&auml;rchen aus Schwaben, p. 305, the questions
are, How far is it to heaven? How deep is the sea? How many
leaves has a linden? and the shepherd again undertakes the
answers.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d045_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>

'Der Muller ohne Sorgen,' M&uuml;llenhoff, p. 153,
208, is a mutilated variation of these. The abbot disappears, and
the questions are put to the miller, who answers for himself. The
second question is How much does tbe moon weigh? and the answer,
Four quarters; if you don't believe it, you must weigh for
yourself.</p>

<p>We meet the miller <i>sans souci</i> again in a Danish tale,
which otherwise agrees entirely with our ballad. The questions
are answered by the rich miller's herdsman: Grundtvig, Gamle
danske Minder, 1854, p. 112, No 111.</p>

<p>A Croatian version of the story is given by Valyavets, 'Frater
i turski car,' p. 262. The Turkish tsar is disposed to expel all
monks from his dominions, but determines first to send for an
abbot to try his calibre. The abbot is too much frightened to go,
and his cook, as in Foligno and Timoneda, takes his place. The
questions are, Where is the centre of the world? What is God
doing now? What am I thinking? The first and third are disposed
of in the usual way. When called to answer the second, the cook
said, You can't see through the ceiling: we must go out into the
field. When they came to the field, the cook said again, How can
I see when I am on such a small ass? Let me have your horse. The
sultan consented to exchange beasts, and then the cook said, God
is wondering that a sultan should be sitting on an ass and a monk
on a horse. The sultan was pleased with the answers, and
reasoning, If the cook is so clever, what must the abbot be,
decided to let the monks alone. Afanasief, who cites this story
from Valyavets (Narodnuiya russkiya Skazki, VIII, 460), says that
he heard in the government of Voroneje a story of a soldier who
dressed himself as a monk and presented himself before a tsar who
was in the habit of puzzling people with riddles. The questions
are, How many drops in the sea? How many stars in the sky? What
do I think? And the answer to the last is, Thou thinkest,
gosudar, that I am a monk, but I am merely a soldier.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d045_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A few tales, out of many remaining, may be now briefly
mentioned, on account of variations in the setting.</p>

<p>A prisoner is to be released if he can tell a queen how much
she is worth, the centre of the world, and what she thinks. A
peasant changes clothes with the prisoner, and answers <i>pro
more</i>. Kurtzweiliger Zeitvertreiber durch C.A.M. von W., 1668,
p. 70 f, in K&ouml;hler, Orient u. Occident, I, 43.</p>

<p>A scholar has done learning. His master says he must now answer
three questions, or have his head taken off. The master's
brother, a miller, comes to his aid. The questions are, How many
ladders would reach to the sky? Where is the middle of the world?
What is the world worth? Or, according to another tradition, the
two last are, How long will it take to go round the world? What
is my thought? Campbell, Popular Tales of the West Highlands, II,
391 f.</p>

<p>Eulenspiegel went to Prague, and advertised himself on the
doors of the churches and lecture-rooms as a great master,
capable of answering questions that nobody else could solve. To
put him down, the rector and his colleagues summoned Eulenspiegel
to an examination before the university. Five questions were
given him: How much water is there in tbe sea? How many days from
Adam to now? Where is the middle of the world? How far from earth
to heaven? What is the breadth of the sky? Lappenberg, Dr. Thomas
Murners Ulenspiegel, p. 38, No 28; Howleglas, ed. Ouvry, p.
28.</p>

<p>A herdboy had a great fame for his shrewd answers. The king did
not believe in him, but sent for him, and said, If you can answer
three questions that I shall put, I will regard you as my own
child, and you shall live

in my palace. The questions are, How
many drops of water are there in the ocean? How many stars in the
sky? How many seconds in eternity? The Grimms, K. u. H.
m&auml;rchen, No 152, 'Das Hirtenb&uuml;blein.'</p>

<p>Three questions are put to a counsellor of the king's, of which
the first two are, Where does the sun rise? How far from heaven
to earth? The answers, by a shepherd, are extraordinarily feeble.
J&uuml;disches Maas&auml;buch, cap. 126, cited from Helwigs
J&uuml;dische Historien, No 39, in the Grimms' note to Das
Hirtenb&uuml;blein.</p>

<p>Three monks, who know everything, in the course of their
travels come to a sultan's dominions, and he invites them to turn
Mussulmans. This they agree to do if he will answer their
questions. All the sultan's doctors are convened, but can do
nothing with the monks' questions. The hodja (the court-fool) is
sent for. The first question, Where is the middle of the earth?
is answered as usual. The second monk asks, How many stars are
there in the sky? The answer is, As many as there are hairs on my
ass. Have you counted? ask the monks. Have you counted? rejoins
the fool. Answer me this, says the same monk, and we shall see if
your number is right: How many hairs are there in my beard? "As
many as in my ass's tail" "Prove it." "My dear man, if you don't
believe me, count yourself; or we will pull all the hairs out of
both, count them, and settle the matter." The monks submit, and
become Mussulmans. Les plaisanteries de Nasr-eddin Hodja,
traduites du turc par J.A. Decourdemanche, No 70, p. 59 ff.</p>

<p>The Turkish emperor sends word to Kaiser Leopold that unless the
emperor can answer three questions he shall come down upon him
with all his Turks. The counsellors are summoned, but there is
no help in them. The court-fool offers to get his master out of
the difficulty, if he may have the loan of crown and sceptre.
When the fool comes to Constantinople, there lies the sultan in
the window, and calls out, Are you the emperor, and will you
answer my questions? Where does the world end? " Here, where my
horse is standing." How far is it to heaven? "One day's journey,
and no inn on the road." What is God thinking of now? " He is
thinking that I am one fool and you another." J.W. Wolf,
