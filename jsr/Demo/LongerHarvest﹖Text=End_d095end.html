of which she only recollects three lines:<br/>
<br/>
And I 'm not come to set you free,<br/>
But I am come to see you hanged,<br/>
All under the gallows-tree.<br/>

The last line was repeated, I believe, in 
every verse." <i>William Andrews.</i></td></tr>

<td><i>The verses form part of a Yorkshire story 
called</i> The Golden Ball. <i>A man gives 
a golden ball to each of two lasses, and if 
either loses the ball she is to be hanged. 
The younger, while playing with her ball, 
tosses it over a park-paling; the ball runs 
away over the grass into a house, and is 
seen no more.</i><br/>

"Now t' lass was taken to York to be 
hanged. She was brought out on t' scaffold, and t' hangman said, Now, lass, tha 
must hang by t' neck till tha be'st dead. 
But she cried out, Stop, stop," <i>etc., stanzas</i>
1-3.<br/>

"Then the hangman said. Now, lass, say 
thy prayers, for tha must dee." <i>Stanzas</i>
4-6 <i>follow. The maid thinks she sees her 
brother coming, her sister, uncle, aunt, 
cousin. The Hangman then says,</i> "I 
wee-nt stop no longer, tha 's making gam 
of me. Tha must be hung at once. But 
now she saw her sweetheart coming through 
the crowd, and he had over head i t' air 
her own golden ball. So she said," <i>as in 
stanzas</i> 7-9.</td></tr>

<td><i>Miss Kate Thompson, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, had when
a child frequently been 
told the story of The Golden Ball by a 
woman who was a native of the Borderland. A rich lady possessed a golden 
ball, which she held in high esteem. A 
poor girl, her servant, had to clean this 
ball every day, and it was death to lose 
it. One day when she was cleaning the 
ball near a stream it disappeared. The 
girl was condemned to die, and had 
mounted the scaffold. The story was all 
in prose up to the execution, when the 
narrator broke into rhyme:</i><br/>
<br/>
'Stop the rope! stop the rope!<br/>
For here I see my mother coming.<br/>
'Oh mother, have you brought the golden ball,<br/>
And come to set me free?<br/>
Or are you only here to see me die,<br/>
Upon the high, high gallows-tree?'<br/>
<i>The mother answers that she has only come to see her die.
Other relatives follow, and last of all comes the lover, who
produces the ball, and the execution is stopped. Miss Thompson
adds that two Northumbrian servants in her house remember the
story so.</i></td></tr>
