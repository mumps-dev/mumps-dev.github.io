<h3>Willie and Earl Richard's Daughter</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'The Birth of Robin Hood,' Jamieson's Popular 
Ballads, II, 44. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d10201.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
<li>'The Birth of Robin Hood,' Buchan's Ballads of the 
North of Scotland, II, 1. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d10202.html"><i>Version B</i></a></li>
<li>Kinloch's Manuscripts, V, 330 f, two stanzas. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d10203.html"><i>Version C</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p><b>A</b> was taken down from Mrs. Brown's recitation by
Jamieson in 1800, and published in his collection in 1806,
"without the alteration of a single word." <b>C</b> wrongly forms
the conclusion of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_101.html">Willie o Douglas Dale</a>,' the preceding ballad.
The copy in Christie's Traditional Ballad Airs, I, 128, is an
abridgment of <b>B</b>, with a very few trivial changes.</p>

<p>The first half of the story in <b>A</b>, 1-9, is that of
'Willie of Douglas Dale,' <b>A</b>, 1-24, and there is a partial
verbal correspondence.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d102_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In the latter a shepherd's daughter
is engaged as nurse to the boy born in the wood, and Dame
Oliphant is taken home by her lover and made lady of Douglas
Dale. In the present ballad the lady's father tracks his daughter
to the wood, finds the new-born child, adopts him as his
grandson, and gives him the name Robin Hood, Willie [Archibald]
disappearing from the scene.</p>

<p>The first part of <b>B</b> 4-18 is a variety of the
wide-spread tragic ballad of 'Leesome Brand,' No 15. So, also, is
the larger part of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_101.html">Willie o Douglas Dale</a>,' with the tragic
features dropped.</p>

<p>This ballad certainly does not belong to the cycle of Robin
Hood, and for this reason the title hitherto borne by it could
not be retained. The connection with Robin Hood was in all
probability mediated by the name Brown Robin. Brown Robin plays
the part of Willie [Archibald] in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_103.html">Rose the Red and White Lily</a>,'
<b>A</b> 25-29. Brown Robin's son, in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_90.html">Jellon Grame</a>,' is called
Robin after Robin Hood, <b>B</b> 14, <b>C</b> 7, 17. Brown Robin
carries off his love to the wood in the ballad of the same name.
The Earl of Huntingdon, <b>B</b> 3, 21, has no place in the
ancient traditional ballads of Robin Hood, but is of later
literary invention. <b>A</b> 17, <b>B</b> 1, <b>C</b> 1, may,
however, very well have belonged to some Robin Hood ballad.</p>

<p><b>A</b> is translated by Grundtvig, Engelske og 
skotske Folkeviser, p. 22, No 3.</p>
