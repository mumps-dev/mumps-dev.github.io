<p>'The Queen of the Fairies,' Macmath Manuscript, p. 57. "Taken
down by me 14th October, 1886, from the recitation of Mr.
Alexander Kirk, Inspector of Poor, Dairy, in the Stewartry of
Kirkcudbright, who learned it about fifty years ago from the
singing of David Ray, Barlay, Balmaclellan."</p>

<p>This copy has been considerably made over, and was very likely
learned from print. The cane in the maid's hand, already
sufficiently occupied, either with the Bible or with holy water,
is an imbecility such as only the "makers" of latter days are
capable of. (There is a cane in another ballad which I cannot at
this moment recall.)</p>

<p>A king transformed into a nightingale being plunged three
times into water resumes his shape: Vernaleken, K.- u. H.
M&auml;rchen, No 15, p. 79. In Guillaume de Palerne, ed.
Michelant, v. 7770 ff., pp. 225, 226, the queen who changes the
werewolf back into a man takes care that he shall have a warm
bath as soon as the transformation is over; but this may be
merely the bath preliminary to his being dubbed knight (as in Li
Chevaliers as Deus Espees, ed. F&ouml;rster, vv. 1547-49, p. 50,
and L'Ordene de Chevalerie, vv. 111-124, Barbazan-M&eacute;on, I,
63, 64). A fairy maiden is turned into a wooden statue. This is
burned and the ashes thrown into a pond, whence she immediately
emerges in her proper shape. She is next doomed to take the form
of a snake. Her lover, acting under advice, cuts up a good part
of the snake into little bits, and throws these into a pond. She
emerges again. J.H. Knowles, Folk-Tales of Kashmir, p. 468 ff..

one-eyed woman an eye of crystal, warning her not to speak of
what she may see with it. Disregarding this injunction, the woman
is deprived of the gift. S&eacute;billot, Contes pop. de la
