<p><b>B</b> can be traced in Banffshire, according to Christie,
for more than a hundred years, through the old woman that sang
it, and her forbears. <b>C</b> <b>a</b>, <b>D</b> were originally
published by Allies in the year 1845, in a pamphlet bearing the
title The Jovial Hunter of Bromsgrove, Home the Hunter, and Robin
Hood. No intimation as to the source of his copy, <b>C</b>
<b>b</b>, is given by Bell, i.e., Dixon. Apparently all the
variations from Allies, <b>C</b> <b>a</b>, are of the nature of
editorial improvements. <b>E</b> <b>a</b> is said (1857) to be
current in the north of England as a nursery song.</p>

<p>One half of <b>A</b>, the oldest and fullest copy of this
ballad (the second and fourth quarters), is wanting in the Percy
Manuscript What we can gather of the story is this. A knight
finds a lady sitting in a tree, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>
[under a tree, <b>E</b>] , who tells him that a wild boar has
slain Sir Broning, <b>A</b> [killed her lord and thirty of his
men, <b>C</b>; worried her lord and wounded thirty, <b>B</b>].
The knight kills the boar, <b>B</b>-<b>D</b>, and seems to have
received bad wounds in the process, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; the boar
belonged to a giant, <b>B</b>; or a wild woman, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>. The knight is required to forfeit his hawks and leash,
and the little finger of his right hand, <b>A</b> [his horse, his
hound, and his lady, <b>C</b>]. He refuses to submit to such
disgrace, though in no condition to resist, <b>A</b>; the giant
allows him time to heal his wounds, forty days, <b>A</b>;
thirty-three, <b>B</b>; and he is to leave his lady as security
for his return, <b>A</b>. At the end of this time the knight
comes back sound and well,
<a name="Page_I_209"/>
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and kills the
giant as he had killed the boar, <b>B</b>. <b>C</b> and <b>D</b>
say nothing of the knight having been wounded. The wild woman, to
revenge her "pretty spotted pig," flies fiercely at him, and he
cleaves her in two. The last quarter of the Percy copy would, no
doubt, reveal what became of the lady who was sitting in the
tree, as to which the traditional copies give no light.</p>

<p>Our ballad has much in common with the romance of 'Sir
Eglamour of Artois,' Percy Manuscript, Hales and Furnivall, II,
338; Thornton Romances, Camden Society, ed. Halliwell, p. 121;
Ellis, Metrical Romances, from an early printed copy, Bohn's ed.,
p. 527. Eglamour, simple knight, loving Christabel, an earl's
daughter, is required by the father, who does not wish him well,
to do three deeds of arms, the second being to kill a boar in the
kingdom of Sattin or Sydon, which had been known to slay forty
armed knights in one day (Percy, st. 37). This Eglamour does,
after a very severe fight. The boar belonged to a giant, who had
kept him fifteen years to slay Christian men (Thornton, st. 42,
Percy, 40). This giant had demanded the king of Sy don's
daughter's hand, and comes to carry her off, by force, if
necessary, the day following the boar-fight. Eglamour, who had
been found by the king in the forest, in a state of exhaustion,
after a contest which had lasted to the third or fourth day, and
had been taken home by him and kindly cared for, is now ready for
action again. He goes to the castle walls with a squire, who
carries the boar's head on a spear. The giant, seeing the head,
exclaims,</p>

<p>'Alas, art thou dead.!<br/>
My trust was all in thee!<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now by the law that I lieve in,<br/>
My little speckled hoglin,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dear bought shall thy death be.'<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Percy, st. 44.</p>

<p>Eglamour kills the giant, and returns to Artois with both
heads. The earl has another adventure ready for him, and hopes
the third chance may quit all. Eglamour asks for twelve weeks to
rest his weary body.</p>

<p><b>B</b> comes nearest the romance, and possibly even the wood
of Tore is a reminiscence of Artois. The colloquy with the giant
in <b>B</b> is also, perhaps, suggested by one which had
previously taken place between Eglamour and another giant,
brother of this, after the knight had killed one of his harts
(Percy, st. 25). <b>C</b> 11, <b>D</b> 9 strikingly resemble the
passage of the romance cited above (Percy, 44, Thornton, 47).</p>

<p>The ballad has also taken up something from the romance of
'Eger and Grime,' Percy Manuscript, Hales and Furnivall, I, 341;
Laing, Early Metrical Tales, p. 1; 'Sir Eger, Sir Grahame, and
Sir Gray-Steel,' Ellis's Specimens, p. 546. Sir Egrabell
(Rackabello, Isaac-a-Bell), Lionel's father, recalls Sir Eger,
and Hugh the Graeme in <b>B</b> is of course the Grahame or Grime
of the romance, the Hugh being derived from a later ballad.
Gray-Steel, a man of proof, although not quite a giant, cuts off
the little finger of Eger's right hand, as the giant proposes to
do to Lionel in <b>A</b> 21.</p>

<p>The friar in E 1<sup>3</sup>, 4<sup>1</sup>, may be a
corruption of Ryalas, or some like name, as the first line of the
burden of <b>E</b>, 'Wind well, <i>Lion</i>, good hunter,' seems
to be a perversion of 'Wind well thy horn, good hunter,' in
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d018_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This part of the burden, especially as
it occurs in <b>A</b>, is found, nearly, in a fragment of a song
of the time of Henry VIII, given by Mr. Chappell in his Popular
Music of the Olden Time, I, 58, as copied from "Manuscripts Reg.,
Append. 58."</p>

<p>'Blow thy home, hunter,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cum, blow thy home on hye!<br/>
In yonder wode there lyeth a doo,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fayth she woll not dye.<br/>
Cum, blow thy home, hunter,<br/>
Cum, blow thy borne, joly hunter!'</p>

<p>A terrible swine is a somewhat favorite figure in romantic
tales. A worthy peer of the boar of Sydon is killed by King
Arthur in 'The Avowynge of King Arthur,' etc., Robson, Three
Early English Metrical Romances (see st. xii). But both of these,
and even the Erymanthian, must lower their bristles before
<a name="Page_I_210"/>
the
boar in 'Kilhwch and Olwen,' Mabinogion, Part iv, pp. 309-16.
Compared with any of these, the "felon sow" presented by Ralph
Rokeby to the friars of Richmond (Evans, Old Ballads, II, 270,
ed. 1810, Scott, Appendix to Rokeby, note M) is a tame villatic
pig: the old mettle is bred out.</p>

<p>Professor Grundtvig has communicated to me a curious Danish
ballad of this class, 'Limgrises Vise,' from a manuscript of the
latter part of the 16th century. A very intractable damsel, after
rejecting a multitude of aspirants, at last marries, with the
boast that her progeny shall be fairer than Christ in heaven. She
has a litter of nine pups, a pig, and a boy. The pig grows to be
a monster, and a scourge to the whole region.</p>

<p>He drank up the water from dike and from dam,<br/>
And ate up, besides, both goose, gris and lamb.</p>

<p>The beast is at last disposed of by baiting him with the nine
congenerate dogs, who jump down his throat, rend liver and
lights, and find their death there, too. This ballad smacks of
the broadside, and is assigned to the 16th century. A fragment of
a Swedish swine-ballad, in the popular tone, is given by Dybeck,
Runa, 1845, p. 23; another, very similar, in Axelson's
Vesterdalarne, p. 179, 'Koloregris,' and Professor Sophus Bugge
has recovered some Norwegian verses. The Danish story of the
monstrous birth of the pig has become localized: the Liimfiord is
related to have been made by the grubbing of the Limgris: Thiele,
Danmarks Folkesagn, n. 19, two forms.</p>

<p>There can hardly be anything but the name in common between
the Lionel of this ballad and Lancelot's cousin-german.</p>
