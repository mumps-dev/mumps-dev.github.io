<p>All the Scottish versions were obtained within the first third
of this century, and since then no others have been heard of. It
is interesting to find the ballad still in the mouths of children
in American cities, &mdash; in the mouths of the poorest, whose
heritage these old things are.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d049_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The American versions, though
greatly damaged, preserve the names John and William, which all
the other copies have.</p>

<p><b>B</b> and <b>C</b> are considerably corrupted. It need
hardly be mentioned that the age of the boys in the first two
stanzas of <b>B</b> does not suit the story. According to
<b>C</b> 8, 15, the mother had cursed John, before he left home,
with a wish that he might never return; and in <b>C</b> 9, John
sends word to his true-love that he is in his grave for her dear
sake alone. These points seem to have been taken from some copy
of 'Willie and May Margaret,' or 'The Drowned Lovers.' The
conclusion of both <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> belongs to '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_77.html">Sweet William's Ghost</a>.'
<b>C</b> 18 may be corrected by <b>B</b> 10,
though there is an absurd jumble of pipes and harp in the latter.
The harp, in a deft hand, effects like wonders in many a ballad:
e.g., 'Harpens Kraft,' Grundtvig, II, 65, No 40; even a pipe in
<b>C</b> 14-16 of the same.</p>

<p><b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b> supplement the story
with more or less of the ballad of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_13.html">Edward</a>:' see p. 168.</p>

<p>Jamieson inquires for this ballad in the Scots Magazine for
October, 1803, p. 701, at which time he had only the first stanza
and the first half of the third. He fills out the imperfect
stanza nearly as in the copy which he afterwards printed:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>But out an Willie's taen his knife,<br/>
And did his brother slay.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Of the five other Scottish versions, all except <b>B</b> make
the deadly wound to be the result of accident, and this is, in
Motherwell's view, a point essential. The other reading, he says,
is at variance with the rest of the story, and "sweeps away the
deep impression this simple ballad would otherwise have made upon
the feelings: for it is almost unnecessary to mention that its
touching interest is made to centre in the boundless sorrow and
cureless remorse of him who had been the unintentional cause of
his brother's death, and in the solicitude which that high-minded
and generous spirit expresses, even in the last agonies of
nature, for the safety and fortunes of the truly wretched and
unhappy survivor," But the generosity of the dying man is plainly
greater if his brother has killed him in an outburst of passion;
and what is gained this way
<a name="Page_I_436"/>
will fully offset the loss, if any,
which comes from the fratricide having cause for "cureless
remorse" as well as boundless sorrow. Motherwell's criticism, in
fact, is not quite intelligible. (Minstrelsy, p. 61.)</p>

<p>The variation in the story is the same as that between the
English 'Cruel Brother' and the German 'Graf Friedrich:' in the
former the bride is killed by her offended brother; in the latter
it is the bridegroom's sword slipping from its sheath that
inflicts the mortal hurt.</p>

<p>Motherwell was inclined to believe, and Kirkpatrick Sharpe was
convinced, that this ballad was founded upon an event that
happened near Edinburgh as late as 1589, that of one of the
Somervilles having been killed by his brother's pistol
accidentally going off. Sharpe afterward found a case of a boy of
thirteen killing a young brother in anger at having his hair
pulled. This most melancholy story, the particulars of which are
given in the last edition of the Ballad Book, p. 130, note xix,
dates nearly a hundred years later, 1682. Only the briefest
mention need be made of these unusually gratuitous surmises.</p>

<p>Kirkland, in <b>D</b>, was probably suggested by the kirkyard
of other versions, assisted, possibly, by a reminiscence of the
Kirkley in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_120.html">Robin Hood's Death</a> and Burial;' for it will be
observed that stanzas 8, 9 of <b>D</b> come pretty near to those
in which Robin Hood gives direction for his grave; <b>F</b> 9,
10, <b>B</b> 5, 6 less near.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d049_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Cunningham has entitled a romance of his, upon the theme of
'The Two Brothers' (which, once more, he ventures to print nearly
in the state in which he once had the pleasure of hearing it
sung), '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_62.html">Fair Annie</a> of Kirkland:' Songs of Scotland, II, 16.</p>

<p>The very pathetic passage in which the dying youth directs that
father, mother, and sister shall be kept in ignorance of his
death, and then, feeling how vain the attempt to conceal the fact
from his true-love will be, bids that she be informed that he is
in his grave and will never come back, is too truly a touch of
nature to be found only here. Something similar occurs in
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_173.html">Mary Hamilton</a>,' where, however, the circumstances are
very
different:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'And here's to the jolly sailor lad<br/>
That sails upon the faeme!<br/>
And let not my father nor mother get wit<br/>
But that I shall come again.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>And here's to the jolly sailor lad<br/>
That sails upon the sea!<br/>
But let not my father nor mother get wit<br/>
O the death that I maun dee.'</td></tr>

</table>

<p>In a fine Norse ballad (see '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_57.html">Brown Robyn's Confession</a>,' further
on) a man who is to be thrown overboard to save a ship takes his
leave of the world with these words:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'If any of you should get back to land,<br/>
And my foster-mother ask for me,<br/>
Tell her I 'm serving in the king's court,<br/>
And living right merrily.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'If any of you should get back to land,<br/>
And my true-love ask for me,<br/>
Bid her to marry another man,<br/>
For I am under the sea.'</td></tr>

</table>

<p>A baron, who has been mortally wounded in a duel, gives this
charge to his servant:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'Faites mes compliments &agrave; ma femme,<br/>
Mais ne lui dites pas que j'ai &eacute;t&eacute; tu&eacute;;<br/>
Mais dites lui que je serai all&eacute; &agrave; Paris,<br/>
Pour saluer le roi Louis.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'Dites que je serai all&eacute; &agrave; Paris,<br/>
Pour saluer le roi Louis,<br/>
Et que j'ai achet&eacute; un nouveau cheval,
Le petit c&oelig;ur de mon cheval &eacute;tait trop gai.'<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Le Seigneur de Rosmadec, Luzel,
368/369, 374/375)</td></tr>

</table>

<p>In like manner a dying klepht: "If our comrades ask about me,
tell them not that I have died: say only that I have married in
strange lands; have taken the flat stone for mother-in-law, the
black earth for my wife, the black worms for brothers-in-law."

again, Zambelios, p. 672, No 94, Passow, p. 113, No 146. In the
Danish 'Elveskud,' Grundtvig, II, 115, No 47, <b>B</b> 18, Ole would
simply have the tragic truth kept from his bride:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'Hearken, Sir Ole, of mickle pride,<br/>
How shall I answer thy young bride?'</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'You must say I am gone to the wood,<br/>
To prove horse and hounds, if they be good.'</td></tr>

<p>Such questions and answers as we have in <b>D</b> 20, <b>E</b>
17, <b>F</b> 24, are of the commonest occurrence in popular
poetry, and not unknown to the poetry of art. Ballads of the
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_13.html">Edward</a>' class end generally or always in this way: see p. 168.
We have again the particular question and answer which occur here
in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_51.html">Lizie Wan</a>' and in one version of 'The Trooper and Fair Maid,'
Jamieson's Popular Ballads, II, 158. The question may be: When
will you come back? When shall you cease to love me? When shall
we be married? etc.; and the answer: When apple-trees grow in the
seas; when fishes fly and seas gang dry; when all streams run
together; when all swift streams are still; when it snows roses
and rains wine; when all grass is rue; when the nightingale sings
on the sea and the cuckoo is heard in winter; when poplars bear
cherries and oaks roses; when feathers sink and stones swim; when
sand sown on a stone germinates, etc., etc. See Virgil, Ecl. i,
