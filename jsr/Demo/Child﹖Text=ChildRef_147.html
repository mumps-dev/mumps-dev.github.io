<p>Entered, says Ritson, in the Stationers' book, by Francis
Grove, 2d June, 1656.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d147_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Being directed to be sung to the tune
"R.H. was a tall young man," that is, R.H.'s Progress to
Nottingham, this ballad is the later of the two.</p>

<p>Robin Hood, disguised as a friar, asks charity of two priests.
They pretend to have been robbed, and not to have a penny. Robin
pulls them from their horses, saying, Since you have no money, we
will pray for some, and keeps them at their prayers for an hour.
Now, he says, we will see what heaven has sent us; but the monks
can find nothing in their pockets. We must search one another,
Robin says, and beginning the operation finds five hundred pounds
on the monks. Of this he gives fifty pounds to each of the
priests to pay for their prayers, keeping the remainder. The
priests would now move on, but Robin requires three oaths of
them, of truth, chastity and charity, before he lets them go.</p>

<p>The kernel of the story is an old tale which we find
represented in Pauli's Schimpf und Ernst, 1533, Osterley, p. 397,
Anhang, No 14, 'Wie drey lantzknecht vmb ein zerung batten.'
Three soldiers, out of service, meet the cellarer of a rich
Benedictine cloister, who has a bag hanging at his saddle-bow,
with four hundred ducats in it. They ask for some money, for
God's sake and good fellowship's. The cellarer answers that he
has no money: there is nothing but letters in his bag. Then,
since we all four are without money, they say, we will kneel down
and pray for some. After a brief orison, the three jump up,
search the bag, and find four hundred ducats. The cellarer offers
them a handsome douceur, and says he had the money in the bag
before; but to this they will give no credence. They give the
monk his share of one hundred, and thank God devoutly for his
grace. Retold by Waldis, with a supplement, Esopus, IV, 21, ed.
Kurz, II, 64; and by others, see Oesterley's notes, p. 552,
Kurz's, p. 156.</p>

<p><b>a</b> seems to be signed L.P., and these would most
naturally be the initials of the versifier.</p>
