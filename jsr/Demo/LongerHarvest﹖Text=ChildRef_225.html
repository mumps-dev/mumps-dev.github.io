<p>The hero of this ballad was the youngest of the five sons of
the Rob Roy who has been immortalized by Sir Walter Scott, and
was known as Robert Oig, young, or junior. When a mere boy (only
twelve years old, it is said) he shot a man mortally whom he
considered to have intruded on his mother's land, and for not
appearing to underlie the law for this murder he was outlawed in
1736. He had fled to the continent, and there he enlisted in the
British army, and was wounded and made prisoner at Fontenoy in
1745. He was exchanged, returned to Scotland and obtained a
discharge from service, and, though still under ban, was able to
effect a marriage with a woman of respectable family. She lived
but a few years, and after her death, whether spontaneously or
under the influence of his brother James, a man of extraordinary
hardihood, Rob Oig formed a plan of bettering his own fortune,
and incidentally that of his kin, by a marriage of the Sabine
fashion with a woman of means. The person selected was Jean Key,
who had been two months the widow of John Wright. She was but
nineteen years of age, and was living with her mother at
Edinbelly, in Stirlingshire, and her property is said to have
been, not the twenty thousand pounds of some of the ballads, but
some sixteen or eighteen thousand marks.</p>

<p>On the night of December 8, 1750, Rob Oig, accompanied by his
brothers James and Duncan and others, first placing guards at the
door and windows, to prevent escape from within and help from
without, entered the house of Jean Key, and not finding her,
because she had taken alarm and hidden her self in a closet,
obliged the mother to produce her daughter, under threats " to
murder every person in the family, or to burn the house and every
person in it alive." Jean Key, on being brought out, was told by
James MacGregor that the party had come to marry her to Robert,
his brother. "Upon her desiring to be allowed till next morning,
or some few hours, to deliberate upon the answer she was to give
to so unexpected and sudden a proposal as a marriage betwixt her,
then not two months a widow, and a man with whom she had no
manner of acquaintance," after some little expostulation, they
laid hands upon her, dragged her out of doors, tied her on the
back of a horse, and carried her first to a house at Buchanan,
six miles from Edinbelly, thence to Rowerdennan, "thence, by
water, to some part of the Highlands about the upper part of Loch
Lomond, out of the reach of her friends and relations, where she
was detained in captivity and carried from place to place for
upwards of three months." At Rowerdennan, or further north, a
priest read the marriage-service while the resolute James held up
the young woman before him, and declared Rob Oig and her to be
man and wife.</p>

<p>The rest of the story does not come into the ballad, but it
may be added that both the military and the civil power took the
matter in hand; that the MacGregors found it necessary to release
their captive (who died, but not of the violence she had
undergone, ten months after she was taken away); that James
MacGregor was brought to trial in July, 1752, for hamesucken
(invasion of a private house), forcible abduction of a woman, and
constraining her to a marriage, was convicted of a part of the
charge but not of the last count, and while the court had the
verdict under consideration made his escape from Edinburgh
castle; that Rob Oig was apprehended the following year, tried
and condemned to death, and was executed in February,
1754.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d225_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>We may easily believe that, as Scott says, the imagination of
half-civilized Highlanders was not much shocked at the idea of
winning a wife in a violent way. It had been common, and they may
naturally have wondered why it should seem so particular in their
instance. It is certain that Jean Key did not receive the
sympathy of all of her own sex. A lady of much celebrity has told
us that it is safest in matrimony to begin with a little
aversion, and there were those in Jean Key's day, and after, who
thought it mere silliness to make a coil about a little
compulsion. "It is not a great many years," Sir Walter Scott
testifies, "since a respectable woman, above the lower rank of
life, expressed herself very warmly to the author on his taking
the free dom to censure the behaviour of the MacGregors on the
occasion in question. She said, 'that there was no use in giving
a bride too much choice upon such occasions; that the marriages
were happiest lang syne which had been done off hand.' Finally,
she averred that her 'own mother had never seen her father till
the night he brought her up from the Lennox with ten head of
black cattle, and there had not been a happier couple in the
country.'"</p>

<p>The ballad adheres to fact rather closely; indeed a reasonably
good "dittay" could be made out of it. The halt at Buchanan is
mentioned <b>B</b> 8, <b>C</b> 10, <b>K</b> 14; the road would be
through Drymen, as in <b>C</b> 10, <b>K</b> 13; and Balmaha,
<b>H</b> 2, is a little beyond Buchanan. Ballyshine is
substituted for Buchanan in <b>B</b> 6, <b>J</b> 4. At Buchanan,
or Ballyshine ('as they came in by Drimmen town, and in by
Edingarry,' <b>K</b> 13), a cloak and gown are bought (fetched)
for the young woman to be married in, <b>B</b> 8, <b>C</b> 10,
<b>F</b> 4. It is a cotton gown, <b>B</b> 6, coat and gown,
<b>A</b> 8; in cotton gown she is married, <b>J</b> 4; meaning
probably that she was married in a night-gown, having been roused
from her bed. It is at Buchanan, or Ballyshine, that she is
married. Four held her up to the priest, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>F</b> (two, <b>D</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, three, <b>E</b>,
<b>J</b>, six, <b>B</b>), four laid her in bed, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b> (two,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>).</p>

<p>Rob Roy is said to come from Drunkie (the home of his first
wife), <b>J</b> 1; to come over the Loch of Lynn, <b>G</b> 2.
Jean Key's abode seems to be called White House (Wright?) in
<b>A</b> 2, but Blackhills, <b>C</b> 2, and in <b>K</b> 2 Jean
Key is called Blackhill's daughter. Blackhill is apparently a
corruption of Mitchell, Jean's mother's maiden name. The mother
is called Jean Mitchell in <b>J</b> 2.</p>

<p>In <b>A</b> 8, Rob Roy's party are wrongly said to tarry at
Stirling. In <b>J</b> 2, Glengyle is said to go with him to steal
Jean Mitchell's daughter. Glengyle, Rob Oig's cousin, and chief
of his immediate family was, for a MacGregor, an orderly
man,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d225_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and did not countenance the proceeding. <b>J</b> 6, 7
belong to the ballad of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_223.html">Eppie Morrie</a>,' No 223.</p>

<p>Rob Oig puts Jean Key's fortune at &#163;20,000, <b>A</b> 13,
<b>C</b> 19; 50,000 merks, <b>D</b> 14; 30,000, <b>K</b> 23;
20,000, which was not very far from right, <b>B</b> 10. The
reading in <b>B</b> 15 is a manifest corruption of thirty
thousand merks.</p>

<p>Old Rob Roy is in several copies spoken of as still alive.
Though the time both of his birth and death is not accurately
known, this was certainly not the case.</p>
