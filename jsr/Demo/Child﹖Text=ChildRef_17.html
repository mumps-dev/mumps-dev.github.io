<p>A defective copy of this ballad was printed in Cromek's Select
Scottish Songs, Ancient and Modern, 1810 (<b>D</b>). A fragment,
comprising the first half of the story, was inserted in "Lowran
Castle, or the Wild Boar of Curridoo: with other Tales," etc., by
Robert Trotter, Dumfries, 1822<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> (<b>F</b>). A complete copy
was first given in Kinloch's Ancient Scottish Ballads, 1827
(<b>G</b>); another, described by the editor as made up from
Cromek's fragment and two copies from recitation, in Motherwell's
Minstrelsy, p. 36,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> later in the same year; and a third,
closely resembling Kinloch's, in Buchan's Ballads of the North of
Scotland, in 1828 (<b>H</b>). Three versions complete, or nearly
so, and a fragment of a fourth are now printed for the first
time, all from Motherwell's manuscripts (<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>E</b>).</p>

<p>The stanza about the auger bore [wimble bore], <b>B</b> 1,
<b>F</b> 3, <b>H</b> 4, is manifestly out of place. It is found
in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_27.html">The Whummil Bore</a>' (see further on), and may have slipped into
'Hind Horn' by reason of its following, in its proper place, a
stanza beginning, "Seven lang years I hae served the king:" cf.
<b>F</b> 2, <b>H</b> 3.</p>

<p><b>G</b> 17, 18, 21, 22, which are not intelligible in their
present connection, are perhaps, as well as <b>G</b> 16, <b>H</b>
18-20, borrowed from some Robin Hood ballad, in which a change is
made with a beggar.</p>

<p>The noteworthy points in the story of Hind Horn are these.
Hind Horn has served the king seven years (<b>D</b>, <b>F</b>),
and has fallen in love with his daughter. She gives Hind Horn a
jewelled ring: as long as the stone keeps its color, he may know
that she is faithful; but if it changes hue, he may ken she loves
another man. The king is angry (<b>D</b>), and Hind Horn
<a name="Page_I_188"/>
goes to
sea [is sent, <b>D</b>]. He has been gone seven years, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b> [seven years and a day, <b>B</b>], when, looking on his
ring, he sees that the stone is pale and wan, <b>A</b>-<b>H</b>.
He makes for the land at once, and, meeting an old beggar, asks
him for news. No news but the king's daughter's wedding: it has
lasted nine days [two and forty, <b>A</b>], and she will not go
into the bride-bed till she hears of Hind Horn, <b>E</b>. Hind
Horn changed cloaks and other gear with the beggar, and when he
came to the king's gate asked for a drink in Horn's name,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>. The bride herself came down, and
gave him a drink out of her own hand, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. He drank out the drink and dropped
in the ring.</p>

<p>'O gat ye 't by sea, or gat ye 't by lan,<br/>
Or gat ye 't aff a dead man's han?'</p>

<p>So she asked; and he answered:</p>

<p>'I gat na 't by sea, I gat na 't by lan,<br/>
But I gat it out of your own han.' <b>D</b> 14.</p>

<p>I got na 't by sea, I got na 't by land,<br/>
Nor got I it aff a drownd man's hand;</p>

<p>'But I got it at my wooing,<br/>
And I'll gie it at your wedding.' <b>G</b> 29, 30.</p>

<p>The bride, who had said,</p>

<p>'I'll go through nine fires so hot,<br/>
But I'll give him a drink for Young Hynhorn's
sake,' <b>B</b> 16,</p>

<p>is no less ready now:</p>

<p>'I'll tak the red gowd frae my head,<br/>
And follow you and beg my bread.</p>

<p>I'll tak the red gowd frae my hair,<br/>
And follow you for evermair.' <b>H</b> 31, 32.</p>

<p>But Hind Horn let his cloutie cloak fall, <b>G</b>,
<b>H</b>, and told her,</p>

<p>'Ye need na leave your bridal gown,<br/>
For I'll make ye ladie o many a town.'</p>

<p>The story of Horn, of which this ballad gives
little more than the catastrophe, is related
at full in</p>

<p>I. 'King Horn,' a gest in about 1550 short verses, preserved
in three manuscripts; the oldest regarded as of the second half
of the 13th century, or older; the others put at 1300 and a
little later. All three have been printed: (1.) By Michel, Horn
et Rimenhild, p. 259 ff, Bannatyne Club, 1845; J.R. Lumby, Early
English Text Society, 1866; and in editions founded on Lumby's
text, by M&auml;tzner, Altenglische Sprachproben, p. 270 ff, and
later by Wissmann, Quellen u. Forschungen, No 45. (2.) By
Horstmann, Archiv f&uuml;r das Studium der neueren Sprachen,
1872, L, 39 ff. (3.) By Ritson, A.E. Metrical Romance&euml;s, II,
91 ff.</p>

<p>II. 'Horn et Rymenhild,' a romance in about 5250 heroic
verses, preserved likewise in three manuscripts; the best in the
Public Library of the university of Cambridge, and. of the 14th
century.</p>

<p>III. 'Horn Childe and Maiden Rimnild,' from a manuscript of
the 14th century, in not quite 100 twelve-line stanzas: Ritson,
Metrical Romance&euml;s, III, 282 ff; Michel, p. 341 ff.</p>

<p>Horn, in the old English gest, is son of Murry [Allof], king
of Suddenne. He is a youth of extraordinary beauty, and has twelve
comrades, of whom Athulf and Fikenild are his favorites. One day,
as Murry was out riding, he came upon fifteen ships of Saracens,
just arrived. The pagans slew the king, and insured themselves,
as they thought, against Horn's future revenge by putting him and
his twelve aboard a vessel without sail or rudder; but "the
children" drove to shore, unhurt, on the coast of Westerness. The
king, Ailmar, gave them a kind reception, and committed them to
Athelbrus, his steward, to be properly brought up. Rymenhild, the
king's daughter,
<a name="Page_I_189"/>
fell in love with Horn, and having, with some
difficulty, prevailed upon Athelbrus to bring him to her bower,
offered herself to him as his wife. It were no fair wedding, Horn
told her, between a thrall and a king, &mdash; a speech which
hurt Rymenhild greatly; and Horn was so moved by her grief that
he promised to do all she required, if she would induce the king
to knight him. This was done the next day, and Horn at once
knighted all his comrades. Rymenhild again sent for Horn, and
urged him now to make her his wife. But Horn said he must first
prove his knighthood: if he came back alive, he would then marry
her. upon this Rymenhild gave him a ring, set with stones of such
virtue that he could never be slain if he looked on it and
thought of his leman. The young knight bad the good fortune to
fall in immediately with a ship full of heathen bounds, and by
the aid of his ring killed a hundred of the best of them. The
next day he paid Rymenhild a visit, and found her drowned in
grief on account of a bad dream. She had cast her net in the sea,
and a great fish had broken it: she weened she should lose the
fish that she would choose. Horn strove to comfort her, but could
not conceal his apprehension that trouble was brewing. The fish
proved to be, Fikenild, Horn's much cherished friend. He told
Ailmar of the intimacy with Rymenhild, and asserted that Horn
meant to kill the king as well as marry the princess. Ailmar was
very angry (v. 724, Wissmann), and much grieved, too. He found
the youth in his daughter's bower, and ordered him to quit the
land anon. Horn saddled his horse and armed himself, then went
back to Rymenhild, and told her that he was going to a strange
land for seven years: if, after that, he neither came nor sent
word, she might take a husband. He sailed a good way eastward (v.
799) to Ireland, and, landing, met two princes, who invited him to
take service with their father. The king, Thurston, welcomed him,
and had soon occasion to employ him; for at Christmas came into
court a giant, with a message from pagans newly arrived. They
proposed that one of them should fight three Christians: If your
three slay our one, Let all this land be your own; If our one
oercomes your three, All this land then ours shall be.' Horn
scorned to fight on such terms; he alone would undertake three of
the hounds; and so he did. In the course of a hard fight it came
out that these were the very heathen that had slain King Murry.
Horn looked on his ring and thought on Rymenhild, then fell on
his foes. Not a man of them escaped; but King Thurston lost many
men in the fight, among them his two sons. Having now no heir, he
offered Horn his daughter Reynild and the succession. Horn
replied that he had not earned such a reward yet. He would serve
the king further; and when he asked for his daughter, he hoped
the king would not refuse her.</p>

<p>Seven years Horn stayed with King Thurston, and to Rymenhild
neither sent nor went. A sorry time it was for her, and worst at
the end, for King Modi of Reynis asked her in marriage, and her
father consented. The wedding was to be in a few days. Rymenhild
despatched messengers to every land, but Horn heard nothing, till
one day, when he was going out to shoot, he encountered one of
these, and learned how things stood. He sent word to his love not
to be troubled; he would be there betimes. But, alas, the
messenger was drowned on his way back, and Rymenhild, peering out
of her door for a ray of hope, saw his body washed up by the
waves. Horn now made a clean breast to Thurston, and asked for
help. This was generously accorded, and Horn set sail for
Westerness. He arrived not too early on, the day of the wedding,
&mdash; "ne might he come no later!" &mdash; left his men in a
wood, and set off for Ailmar's conrt alone. He met a palmer, and
asked his news. The palmer had come from a bridal; a wedding of
maid Rymenhild, who wept and would not be married, because she
had a husband, though he was out of the land. Horn changed clothes
with the palmer, put on the sclavin, took scrip and staff,
blackened his skin and twisted his lip, and presented himself at
the king's gate. The porter would not let him in; Horn kicked
<a name="Page_I_190"/>
open the wicket, threw the porter over the bridge, made his way
into the hall, and sat down in the beggars' row. Rymenhild was
weeping as if she were out of her wits, but after meat she rose
to give all the knights and squires drink from a horn which she
bare: such was the custom. Horn called to her:</p>

<p>'Skink us with the first,<br/>
The beggars ben athirst.'</p>

<p>She laid down her horn and filled him a gallon bowl; but Horn
would not drink of that. He said, mysteriously, "Thou thinkest I
am a beggar, but I am a fisher, come far from the East, to fish
at thy feast. My net lies near at hand, and bath full seven year.
I am come to see if it has taken any fish.</p>

<p>'I am come to fish;<br/>
Drink to me from thy dish,<br/>
Drink to Horn from horn'"</p>

<p>Rymenhild looked at him, a chill creeping over her heart. What
he meant by his fishing she did not see. She filled her horn and
drank to him, handed it to the pilgrim, and said, "Drink thy
fill, and tell me if ever thou saw Horn." Horn drank, and threw
the ring into the vessel. When the princess went to bower, she
found the ring she had given Horn. She feared he was dead, and
sent for the palmer. The palmer said Horn had died on the voyage
to Westerness, and had begged him to go with the ring to
Rymenhild. Rymenhild could bear no more. She threw herself on her
bed, where she had hid a knife, to kill both King Modi and
herself if Horn should not come ; she set the knife to her heart,
and there Horn stopped her. He wiped off the black, and cried, "
I am Horn " Great was their bliss, but it was not a time to
indulge themselves fully.</p>

<p>Horn sprang out of hall,<br/>
And let his sclavin fall, (1246)</p>

<p>and went to summon his knights. Rymenhild sent after him the
faithful Athulf, who all the while had been watching for Horn in
the tower. They slew all that were in the castle, except King
Ailmar and Horn's old comrades. Horn spared even Fikenild, taking
an oath of fidelity from him and the rest. Then he made-himself
known to Ailmar, denied what he had been charged with, and would
not marry Rymenhild even now, not till he had won back Suddenne.
This he went immediately about; but while he was engaged in
clearing the land of Saracens and rebuilding churches, the false
Fikenild bribed yonng and old to side with him, built a strong
castle, "married" Rymenhild, carried her into his fortress, and
began a feast. Horn, warned in a dream, again set sail for
Westerness, and came in by Fikenild's new castle. Athulf's cousin
was on the shore, to tell him what had happened; how Fikenild had
wedded Rymenhild that very day; he bad beguiled Horn twice. Force
would not avail now. Horn disguised himself and some of his
knights as harpers and fiddlers, and their music gained them
admittance. Horn began a lay which threw Rymenhild into a swoon.
This smote him to the heart; he looked on his ring and thought of
her. Fikenhild and his men were soon disposed of. Horn was in a
condition to reward all his faithful adherents. He married Athulf
to Thurston's daughter, and made Rymenhild queen of Suddenne.</p>

<p>The French romance contains very nearly the same story,
extended, by expansions of various sorts, to about six times the
length of King Horn. It would be out of place to notice other
variations than those which relate to the story preserved in the
ballads. Rimild offers Horn a ring when she first avows her love.
He will not take it then, but accepts a second tender, after his
first fight. When he is accused to the king, he offers to clear
himself by combat with heavy odds, but will not submit, king's
son as he is, to pnrgation by oath. The king says, then he" may
quit the land and go &mdash; to Norway, if he will. Horn begs
Rimild to maintain her love for him seven years. If he does not
come then, he will send her word to act thereafter at her
pleasure. Rimild exchanges the ring she had previously given him
for one set with a
<a name="Page_I_191"/>
sapphire, wearing which faithfully he need not
fear death by water nor fire, battle nor tourney (vv 2051-8). He
looks at this ring when he fights with the pagan that had killed
his father, and it fires his heart to. extraordinary exploits
(3166 ff). Having learned through a friend, who had long been
seeking him, that Rimild's father is about to marry her to a
young king (Modun), Horn returns to Brittany with a large force.
He leaves his men in a woody place, and goes out alone on
horseback for news; meets a palmer, who tells him that the
marriage is to take place that very day; gives the palmer his
fine clothes in exchange for sclavin, staff and scrip, forces his
way into the city, and is admitted to the banquet hall with the
beggars. After the guests had eaten (4152 ff), Rimild filled a
splendid cup with piment, presented it first a <i>sun dru</i>, and
then, with her maids, served the whole company. As she was making
her fifth round, Horn pulled her by the sleeve, and reproached
her with attending only to the rich. "Your credit would be
greater should you serve us." She set a handsome cup before him,
but he would not drink. "Corn apelent Horn li Engleis," he said.
"If, for the love of him who bore that name, you would give me the
same horn that you offered your <i>ami</i>, I would share it with
you." All but fainting, Rimild gave him the horn. He threw in his
ring, even that which she had given him at parting, drank out
half, and begged her to drink by the love of him whom he had
named. In drinking, she sipped the ring into her mouth, and she
saw at once what it was (4234). "I have found a ring," said she.
"If it is yours, take it. Blest be he to whom I gave it: if you
know aught of him, conceal it not. If you are Horn, it were a
great sin not to reveal yourself." Horn owned that the ring was
his, but denied knowledge of the man she spake of. For himself,
he had been reared in that land, and by service had come into
possession of a hawk, which, before taming it, he had put in a
cage: that was nigh seven years since: he had come now to see
what it amounted to. If it should prove to be as good as when he
left it, he would carry it away with him; but if its feathers
were ruffled and broken, he would have nothing to do with it. At
this, Rimild broke into a laugh, and cried, " Horn, 't is you,
and your hawk has been safely kept!"<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> She would go with him
or kill herself. Horn saw that she had spoken truth, but, to try
her yet further, said he was indeed Horn, whom she had loved, but
he had come back with nothing: why should she follow a poor wretch
who could not give her a gown to her back? "Little do you know
me," was her reply. "I can bear what you bear, and there is no
king in the East for whom I would quit you."</p>

<p>'Horn Childe and Maiden Rimnild,' with many diversities of its
own as to details, is more like the French than the English
<a name="Page_I_192"/>
romance as to the story, and, on the other hand, has one or two
resemblances to the ballads which they both lack. Rimnild's
father, maddened by the traitor Wikel's false information, beats
her till she bleeds, and threatens to slay Horn. Rimnild,
expecting her lover to be at least exiled, assures Horn that she
will marry no other man for seven years. The king, who had shut
himself up till his first wrath was past, tells Horn, when he
next comes into his presence, that if he is found in the land on
the morrow, he shall be drawn with horses and hanged. Rimnild, at
parting, gives him a ring, with these words:</p>

<p>'Loke thou forsake it for no thing,<br/>
It schal ben our tokening;<br/>
The ston it is wele trewe.<br/>
When the ston wexeth wan,<br/>
Than chaungeth the thou&#541;t of thi leman,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take than a newe;<br/>
When the ston wexeth rede,<br/>
Than have Y lorn mi maidenhed,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O&#541;aines the untrewe.' (Michel, st. 48.)</p>

<p>Horn, for his part, bids her every day look into a spring in
her arbor: should she see his shadow, then he is about to marry
another; till then his thought will not have changed (sts 48,
49). Though loved, as before, by another princess, Horn kept his
faith; but when seven years were gone, on looking at the stone he
saw that its hue was changed (st. 71). He immediately gathered a
force, and set sail for Rimnild. On landing he saw a beggar, who
turned out to be one of his old friends, and had been looking for
him a long time. That day Moging the king was to marry Rimnild.
They changed weeds (76); Horn forced his way into the castle.
While Rimnild was serving the guests, Horn, who had tried to pass
for a fool, called to her to attend to God's men. She fetched him
drink, and he said, "For Horn's love, if ever he was dear to
thee, go not ere this be drunk." He threw the ring into the cup:
she brought him another drink (something is wrong here, for
nothing is said of her seeing and recognizing the ring), and
asked if Horn were there. She fainted when she learned that he
was, but on recovering sent Hatherof (= Athulf) to bid the king
make merry, and then to gather periwinkle and ivy, "grasses that
ben of main" (to stain her face with, no doubt), and then to tell
Horn to wait for her under a woodside.</p>

<p>'When al this folk is gon to play,<br/>
He and Y schal steal oway,<br/>
Bituene the day and the ni&#541;t.' (87)</p>

<p>Hatherof did his message. Of trne love Horn was sure. He said
he would come into the field with a hundred knights. A tournament
follows, as in the French romance; the royal bridegroom is
unhorsed, but spared; treachery is punished and forced to
confession.</p>

<p>Now is Rimnild tuiis wedde,<br/>
Horn brou&#541;t hir to his bedde. (94)</p>

<p>That the lay or gest of King Horn is a far more primitive poem
than the French romance, and could not possibly be derived from
it, will probably be plain to any one who will make even a hasty
comparison of the two; and that the contrary opinion should have
been held by such men as .Warton and Tyrwhitt must have been the
result of a general theory, not of a particular examination.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
There is, on the other hand, no sufficient reason for supposing
that the English lay is the source of the other two poems. Nor do
the special approximations of the ballads to the romance of Horn
Child oblige us to conclude that these, or any of them, are
derived from that poem. The particular resemblances are the
discoloration of the ring, the elopement with the bride, in
<b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b> (which is only prepared for, but not
carried out, in Horn Child), and the agreement between the
couplet just cited from Horn Child,</p>

<p>Now is Rimnild tuiis wedde,<br/>
Horn brou&#541;t hir to his bedde,</p>

<p>and the last stanza of <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>:</p>

<p>The bridegroom he had wedded the bride,<br/>
But Young Hind Horn he took her to bed. (<b>A</b>)</p>

<a name="Page_I_193"/>
<p>The bridegroom thought he had the bonnie bride wed,<br/>
But Young Hyn Horn took the bride to bed. (<b>B</b>)</p>

<p>Her ain bridegroom had her first wed,<br/>
But Young Hyn Horn had her first to bed. (<b>C</b>)</p>

<p>The likeness evinces a closer affinity of the oral traditions
with the later English romance than with the earlier English or
the French, but no filiation. And were filiation to be accepted,
there would remain the question of priority. It is often assumed,
without a misgiving, that oral tradition must needs be younger
than anything *that was committed to writing some centuries ago;
but this requires in each case to be made out; there is certainly
no antecedent probability of that kind.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Two Scandinavian ballads, as Dr. Prior has remarked, seem to
have been at least suggested by the romances of Horn. (1.) 'Unge
Hr. Tor og Jomfru Tore,' Grundtvig, No 72, II, 263, translated by
Prior, III, 151. Of this there are two traditional versions:
<b>A</b> from a manuscript of the sixteenth century, <b>B</b>
from one of the seventeenth. They agree in story. In <b>A</b>, Tor
asks S&oslash;lffuermord how long she will wait for him. Nine
years, she answers, if she can do so without angering her
friends. He will be satisfied with eight. Eight have passed: a
family council is held, and it is decided that she shall not have
Young Tor, but a certain rich count. Her father "gives her away"
that same day. The lady goes up to a balcony and looks seaward.
Everybody seems to be coming home but her lover. She begs her
brother to ride down to the shore for her. Tor is just coming in,
hails the horseman, and eagerly asks how are the maids in the
isle. The brother tells him that Ms maid has waited eight years,
and is even now drinking her bridal, but with tears. Tor takes his
harp and chess-board, and plays ontside the bridal hall till the
bride hears and knows him. He then enters the hall, and asks if
there is anybody that can win a game of chess. The father replies,
Nobody but S&oslash;lffuermord, and she sits a bride at the
board. The mother indulgently suggests that the midsummer day is
long, and the bride might well try a game. The bride seeks an
express sanction of her father, who lessons her the livelong day,
being suspicious of Tor, but towards evening consents to her
playing a little while, &mdash; not long. Tor wins the first
game, and must needs unpack his heart in a gibing parable,
ending</p>

<p>'Full hard is gold to win,<br/>
And so is a trothless quean.'</p>

<p>She wins the next game, takes up the parable,
and says</p>

<p>' Many were glad their faith to hold,<br/>
Were their lot to be controlled.'</p>

<p>They are soon at one, and resolve to fly. They slip away, go
aboard Tor's ship, and put off. The bride's parents get
information, and the "mother, who is a professor of the black
art, raises a storm which she means shall sink them both. No one
can steer the ship but the bride. She stands at the helm, with her
gold crown on, while her lover is lying seasick on the deck, and
she brings the craft safe into Norway, where a second wedding is
celebrated.</p>

<p>(2.) The other ballad is 'Herr Lovmand og Herr Thor,' Syv, iv,
No 68, Danske Viser, iv, 180, No 199, translated by Prior, n,
442. Lovmand, having betrothed Ingelil, asks how long she will be
his maid. "Eight years, if I may," she says. This term has
elapsed; her brothers consult, and give her to rich Herr Thor.
They drink the bridal for five days; for nine days; she will not
go to bed. On the evening of the tenth they begin to use
<a name="Page_I_194"/>
force.
She begs that she may first go to the look-out up-stairs. From
there she sees ships, great and small, and the sails which her
own hands have made for her lover. Her brother goes down to the
sea, as in the other ballad, and has a similar interview. Lovmand
has the excuse of having been sick seven years. He borrows the
brother's horse, flies faster than a bird, and the torch is
burning at the door of the bride's house when he arrives. Thor is
reasonable enough to give up the bride, and to accept Lovmand's
sister.</p>

<p>The ballad is extremely common in Sweden, and at least six
versions have been published. <b>A</b>, 'Herr Lagman och Herr
Thor,' from a manuscript of the end of the sixteenth century,
Arwidsson, 1, 165, No 24; <b>B</b>, from a manuscript, ib., p.
168; <b>C</b>, from oral tradition, p. 171; <b>D</b>, 'Lageman
och hans Brud,' Eva Wigstr&ouml;m, Folkdiktning samlad och
upptecknad i Sk&aring;ne, p. 29, No 12; <b>E</b>, 'Stolt Ingrid,'
Folkvisor fr&aring;n Sk&aring;ne, upptecknade af E.
Wigstr&ouml;m, in Hazelius, ur de nordiska Folkens Lif, p. 121,
No 3; <b>F</b>, 'Deielill och Lageman,' Fagerlund, Anteckningar
om Korpo och Houtsk&auml;rs Socknar, p. 192, No 3. In <b>A</b>,
<b>D</b> the bride goes off in her lover's ship; in <b>C</b> he
carries her off on his horse, when the dancing is at its best,
and subsequently, upon the king's requisition, settles matters
with his rival by killing him in single fight. The stolid
bridegroom, in the others, consents to a peaceable
arrangement.</p>

<p>Certain points in the story of Horn &mdash; the long absence,
the sudden return, the appearance under disguise at the wedding
feast, and the dropping of the ring into a cup of wine obtained
from the bride &mdash; repeat themselves in a great number of
romantic tales. More commonly it is a husband who leaves his wife
for seven years, is miraculously informed on the last day that
she is to be remarried on the morrow, and is restored to his home
in the nick of time, also by superhuman means. Horn is warned to
go back, in the ballads and in Horn Child, by the discoloration
of his ring, but gets home as he tan; this part of the story is
slurred over in a way that indicates a purpose to avoid a
supernatural expedient. Very prominent among the stories referred
to is that of Henry of Brunswick [Henry the Lion, Reinfrid of
Brunswick], and this may well be put first, because it is
preserved in Scandinavian popular ballads.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>(1.) The latest of these, a Swedish ballad, from a collection
made at the end of the last century, 'Hertig Henrik,' Arwidsson,
No 168, 422, represents Duke Henry as telling his wife that he is
minded to go off for seven years (he says not whither, but it is
of course to the East); should he stay eight or nine, she may
marry the man she fancies. He cuts a ring in two; gives her one
half and keeps the other. He is made captive, and serves a
heathen lord and lady seven years, drawing half the plough, "like
another horse." His liberation is not accounted for, but he was
probably set free by his mistress, as in the ballad which
follows. He gets possession of an excellent sword, and uses it on
an elephant who is fighting with a lion. The grateful lion
transports the duke to his own country while he is asleep. A
herdsman, of whom he asks food, recommends him to go to the
Brunswick mansion, where there is a wedding, and Duke Henry's
former spouse is the bride. When Henry comes to the house, his
daughter is standing without; be asks food for a poor pilgrim.
She replies that she has never heard of a pilgrim taking a lion
about with him. But they give him drink, and the bride, pro more,
drinks out of the same bowl, and finds the half ring in the
bottom. The bride feels in her pocket and finds her half,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
and the two, when thrown upon a table, run together and make one
ring.</p>

<a name="Page_I_195"/>
<p>(2.) The Danish ballad<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> (Grundtvig, No 114, <b>B</b>, from
a 17th century manuscript), relates that Duke Henry, in
consequence of a dream, took leave of his wife, enjoining her to
wait to the eighth year, and, if then he did not return, marry
whom she liked. In the course of his fights with the heathen,
Henry was made captive, and had to draw the harrow and plough,
like a beast. One day (during his lord's absence, as we learn
from A) the heathen lady whom he served set him free. He had many
adventures, and in one of them killed a panther who was pressing
a lion hard, for which service the lion followed him like a dog.
The duke then happened upon a hermit, who told him that his wife
was to be married the next day, but he was to go to sleep, and
not be concerned. He laid his head on a stone in the heathen
land, and woke in a trice to hear German speech from a herdsman's
mouth. The herdsman confirmed what the hermit had said: the
duchess was to be married on the morrow. The duke went to the
kitchen as a pilgrim, and sent word to the lady that he wished to
drink to her. The duchess, surprised at this freedom, summoned
him into her presence. The verses are lost in which the cup
should be given the pilgrim and returned to the lady. When she
drank off the wine that was left, a half ring lay in the
glass.</p>

<p>Danish <b>A</b>, though of the 16th century, does
not mention the ring.</p>

<p>(3.) A Flemish broadside, which may originally have been of
the 15th century, relates the adventures of the Duke of Brunswick
in sixty-five stanzas of four long lines: reprinted in von der
Hagen's Germania, VIII, 359, and Hoffmann's Niederl&auml;ndische
Volkslieder, No 2, p. 6; Coussemaker, No 47, p. 152; abridged and
made over, in Willems, O. v. L., p. 251, No 107. The duke, going
to war, tells his wife to marry again if he stays away seven
years. She gives him half of her ring. Seven years pass, and the
duke, being then in desperate plight in a wilderness, is taken
off by a ship; by providential direction, no doubt, though at
first it does not so appear. For the fiend is aboard, who tells
him that his wife is to be married to-morrow, and offers, for his
soul, to carry him to his palace in his sleep before day. The
duke, relying on heaven and his lion, professes to accept the
terms: he is to be taken to his palace in his sleep. The lion
rouses his master at the right time, and the fiend is baffled. The
duke goes to the marriage feast, and sends a message to the bride
that he desires a drink from her in memory of her lord. They take
him for a beggar, but the lady orders him wine in a gold cup. The
cup goes back to her with the duke's half ring in it. She cries,
"It is my husband!" joins her half to the one in the cup, and the
two adhere firmly.</p>

<p>(4.) A German poem of the 15th century, by Michel Wyssenhere,
in ninety-eight stanzas of seven lines, first printed by Massmann,
Denkm&aelig;ler deutscher Sprache mid Literatur, p. 122, and
afterwards by Erlach, ii, 290, and elsewhere. The Lord of
Brunswick receives an impression in a dream that he ought to go
to the Holy Sepulchre. He cuts a ring in two, and gives his wife
one half for a souvenir, but fixes no time for his absence, and
so naturally says nothing about her taking another husband. He
has the adventures which are usual in other versions of the
story, and at last finds himself among the Wild Hunt (das
w&ouml;den her), and obliges one of the company, by conjurations,
to tell him how it is with his wife and children. The spirit
informs him that his wife is about to marry another man. He then
constrains the spirit to transport him and his lion to his
castle. This is done on the same terms as in the Flemish poem,
and the lion wakes his master. His wife offers him drink; he lets
his half ring drop in the glass, and, upon the glass being
returned to the lady, she takes out the token, finds it like her
half, and cries out that she has recovered her dear husband and
lord.</p>

and (modernized) by

Simrock in the first volume of Die deutschen
Volksb&uuml;cher. The hero goes out simply in quest of
adventures, and, having lost his ship and all his companions, is
floating on a raft with his lion, when the devil comes to him and
tells him that his wife is to remarry. A compact is made, and the
devil balked, as before. Though we were not so informed at the
beginning, it now turns out that the duke had given a half ring
to the duchess seven years before, and had bidden her take a
second husband if he did not come back in that time. The duke
sends a servant to beg a drink of wine of his wife, and returns
the cup, as in (3), (4).</p>

gives her one half, vv. 14,906-11. If he dies, she is to marry,
for public reasons, vv. 14,398-407; but she is not to believe a
report of his death unless she receives his half of the ring
back, vv. 14,782816, 15,040-049. The latter part of the romance
not being extant, we do not know the conclusion, but a variation
as to the use made of the ring is probable.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The story of Reinfrit is also preserved in a Bohemian prose
chap-book printed before 1565. This prose is clearly a poem
broken up, and it is believed that the original should be placed
in the first half of the 14th century, or possibly at the end of
the 13th. The hero returns, in pilgrim's garb, after seven years'
absence, to find his wife about to be handed over by her father to
another prince. He lets his ring fall into a cup, and goes away;
his wife recognizes the ring, and is reunited to him. The story
has passed from the Bohemian into Russian and Magyar. Feifalik,
Sitzungsberichte der phil.-hist. Classe der Wiener Akademie, XXTX,
83 ff, the ring at p. 92; XXXII, 322 ff.</p>

<p>Similar use is made of the ring in other German romances. (1.)
'Der edle Moringer' (manuscript of 14th century) asks his wife to
wait seven years for him, while he visits the land of St. Thomas.
He is warned by an angel, at the expiration of that period, that
he will lose her if he does not go back, bewails himself to his
patron, and is conveyed home in a sleep. He begs an alms at his
castle-gate in the name of God, St. Thomas, and the noble
Moringer; is admitted to his wife's presence; sings a lay
describing his own case, which moves the lady much; throws into a
beaker of wine, which she sets before him, the ring by which she
was married to him, sends the cup back to her, and is recognized.
B&ouml;hme, No 6, p. 32; Uhland, No 298, p. 773. (2.) In the
older Hildebrandslied, which is of the 14th century, or earlier,

his ring into a cup of wine presented to him by his wife.

drops Ortnit's ring into a cup of wine sent him by Liebgart, who
has been adjudged to the Graf von Biterne in consideration of his
having, as he pretended, slain the dragon. The cup is returned to
the empress, the ring identified, the pretension refuted, and
<a name="Page_I_197"/>
Liebgart given to Ortnit's avenger. Wolfdietrich B, ed.
J&auml;nicke, I,280 ff, stanzas 767785. (4.) King Rother (whose
history has passages of the strongest resemblance to Horn's),
coming to retrieve his wife, who has been kidnapped and carried
back to her father, lands below Constantinople, at a woody and
hilly place, and assumes a pilgrim's disguise. On his way to the
city he meets a man who tells him that Ymelot of Babylon has
invaded Greece, and taken Constantin, his wife's father,
prisoner; and that Constantin, to save his life, has consented to
give his daughter to the heathen king's son. Rother steals into
the hall, and even under the table at which the royal party are
sitting, and contrives to slip his ring into the hand of his
distressed young queen, who, thus assured of his presence,
immediately recovers her spirits. Massmann, Deutsche Gedichte des
zw&oelig;lften Jahrhunderts, Theil ii, p. 213, vv. 3687-3878. One
of the best and oldest stories of the kind we are engaged with is
transmitted by C&aelig;sarius of Heisterbach in his Dialogus
Miraculorum, of the first quarter of the 13th century. Gerard, a
soldier living in Holenbach ("his grandchildren are still alive,
and there is hardly a man in the town who does not know about
this"), being, like Moringer, devoted to St. Thomas of India, was
impelled to visit his shrine. He broke a ring and gave one half
to his wife, saying, Expect me back in five years, and marry whom
you wish if I do not come then. The journey, which would be long
enongh any way, was providentially protracted. He reached the
shrine at last, and said his prayers, and then remembered that
that was the last day of his fifth year. Alas, my wife will marry
again, he thought; and quite right he was, for the wedding was
even then preparing. A devil, acting under the orders of St
Thomas, set Gerard down at his own door. He found his wife
supping with her second partner, and dropped his half ring into
her cup. She took it out, fitted it to the half which had been
given her, rushed into his arms, and bade good-by to the new
bridegroom. Ed. Strange, II, 131.</p>

<p>A tradition closely resembling this has been found in
Switzerland, Gerard and St. Thomas being exchanged for Wernhart
von Str&auml;ttlingen and St. Michael. Menzel's Odin, p. 96.</p>

<p>Another of the most remarkable tales of this class is
exquisitely told by Boccaccio in the Decamerone, <b>G</b>. x,
<b>N</b>. ix. Messer Torello, going to the crusade, begs his wife
to wait a year, a month, and a day before she marries again. The
lady assures him that she will never be another man's wife; but
he replies that a woman young, beautiful, and of high family, as
she is, will not be allowed to have her way. With her parting
embrace she gives. him a ring from her finger, saying, If I die
before I see you again, remember me when you look on this. The
Christians were wasted by an excessive mortality, and those who
escaped the ravages of disease fell into the hands of Saladin,
and were imprisoned by him in various cities, Torello in
Alexandria. Here he was recognized by Saladin, whom he had
entertained with the most delicate and splendid hospitality a few
months before, when the soldan was travelling through Italy in
disguise. Saladin's return for this courtesy was so magnificent
as almost to put Lombardy out of Torello's head,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and besides
he trusted that his wife had been informed of his safety by a
letter which he had sent. This was not so, however, and the death
of another Torello was reported in Italy as his, in consequence
of which his supposed widow was solicited in marriage, and was
obliged to consent to take another husband after the time should
have expired which she had promised to wait. A week before the
last day, Torello learned that the ship which carried his letter
had been wrecked, and the thonght that his wife would now marry
again drove him almost mad. Saladin extracted from him the cause
of his distress, and promised that he should yet be at home
before the time was out, which Torello, who had heard that such
things had often been
<a name="Page_I_198"/>
done, was ready to believe. And in fact, by
means of one of his necromancers, Saladin caused Torello to be
transported to Pavia in one night &mdash; the night before the new
nuptials. Torello appeared at the banquet the next day in the
guise of a Saracen, under the escort of an uncle of his, a
churchman, and at the right moment sent word to the lady that it
was a custom in his country for a bride to send her cup filled
with wine to any stranger who might be present, and for him to
drink half and cover the cnp, and for her to drink the rest. To
this the lady graciously assented. Torello drank out most of the
wine, dropped in the ring which his wife had given him when they
parted, and covered the cup. The lady, upon lifting the cover,
saw the ring, knew her husband, and, upsetting the table in her
ecstasy, threw herself into Torello's arms.</p>

<p>Tales of this description still maintain themselves in popular
tradition. 'Der Ring ehelicher Treue,' Gottschalk, Deutsche
Volksm&auml;rchen, II, 135, relates how Kuno von Falkenstein,
going on a crusade, breaks his ring and gives one half to his
wife, begging her to wait seven years before she marries again.
He has the adventures of Henry of Brunswick, with differences,
and, like Moringer, sings a lay describing his own case. The new
bridegroom hands him a cup; he drops in his half ring, and passes
the cup to the bride. The two halves join of themselves.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_13}','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>

years, and made captive by the Turks, who condemn him to death on
account of his adhesion to Christ; and is transported to his
chateau on the eve of the day of his doom. This very day his wife
is to take another husband, sorely against her will. Cre'qui
appears in the rags of a beggar, and legitimates himself by
producing his half of the ring (which, in a way not explained by
Rathery, has been brought back by a swan).</p>

<p>'Le Retour du Mari,' Puymaigre, Chants populaires messins, p.
20, has also some traits of ballads of this class. A bridegroom
has to go on a campaign the very day of his nuptials. The
campaign lasts seven years, and the day of his return his wife is
about to re-marry. He is invited to the wedding supper, and
towards the close of it proposes to play cards to see who shall
have the bride. The guests are surprised. The soldier says he
will have the bride without winning her at cards or dice, and,
turning to the lady, asks, Where are the rings I gave you at your
wedding seven years ago? She will go for them; and here the story
breaks off.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The same hard fortune is that of Costantino, a young Albanian,
who is called to the
<a name="Page_I_199"/>
service of his king three days after his
marriage. He gives back her ring to his wife, and tells her he
must go to the wars for nine years. Should he not return in nine
years and nine days, he bids her marry. The young wife says
nothing, waits her nine years and nine days, and then, since she
is much sought for, her father wishes her to marry. She says
nothing, again, and they prepare for the bridal. Costantino,
sleeping in the king's palace, has a bad dream, which makes him
heave a sigh that comes to his sovereign's ear. The king summons
all his soldiers, and inquires who heaved that sigh. Costantino
confesses it was he, and says it was because his wife was
marrying. The king orders him to take the swiftest horse and make
for his home. Costantino meets his father, and learns that his
dream is true, presses on to the church, arrives at the door at
the same time as the bridal procession, and offers himself for a
bride's-man. When they come to the exchange of rings, Costantino
contrives that his ring shall remain on the bride's finger. She
knows the ring; her tears burst forth. Costantino declares
himself as having been already crowned with the lady.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>

<p>With this belongs a ballad, very common in Greece, which,
however, has for the most part lost even more of what was in all
probability the original catastrophe.'

the common story than other versions.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_016','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A man who had been
twelve years a slave after being a bridegroom of three days,
dreams that his wife is marrying, runs to the cellar, and begins
to sing dirges. The king hears, and is moved. "If it is one of
the servants, increase his pay; if a slave, set him free." The
slave tells his story (in three lines); the king bids him take a
swift gray. The slave asks the horses, which is a swift gray.
Only one answers, an old steed with forty wounds. "I am a swift
gray; tie two or three handkerchiefs around your head, and tie
yourself to my back!"<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_017','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> He comes upon his father pruning the
vineyard. "Whose sheep are those feeding in the meadows?" "My
lost son's." He comes to his mother. " What bride are they
marrying?" "My lost son's." "Shall I get to them in church while
they are crowning?" "If you have a fast horse, you will find them
crowning; if you have a bad horse, you will find them at table."
He finds them at church, and calls out, A bad way ye have: why do
ye not bring out the bride, so that strangers may give her the
cup? A good way we have, they answer, we who bring out the bride,
and strangers give her the cup. Then he takes out his ring, while
he is about to present the cup to the bride. The bride can read;
she stands and reads (his name), and bids the company be gone,
for her mate has come, the first crowned.</p>

<p>In other cases we find the hero in prison. He was put in for
thirty days; the keys are lost, and he stays thirty years.

Tommaseo, in, 152, on reaching the church, he cries, "Stand
aside, gentlemen, stand aside, my masters; let the bride pour for
me." She pours him one cup and two, and exclaims (the ring which
was dropped into the cup having dropped out of the story), My
John has come back! Then they both "go out like candles." In
Sakellarios they embrace and fall dead, and when laid in the
grave come up as a cypress and a citron tree. In the Cretan
ballad John does not dismount, but takes the bride on to the
horse and is off with her; so in the beautiful ballad in Fauriel,
II, 140, No 11, '&#7977; &#7945;&#961;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#8053;'
"peut-&ecirc;tre la plus distingu&eacute;e de ce recueil," which
belongs with this group, but seems to be later at the beginning
and the end. Even here the bride takes a cup to pour a draught
for the horseman.</p>

<p>In Russia the ring story is told of Dobrynya and Nastasya.
Dobrynya, sent out shortly after his marriage to collect tribute
for Vladimir, requests Nastasya to wait for him twelve years:
then she may wed again, so it be not with Alesha. Twelve years
pass. Alesha avows that he has seen Dobrynya's corpse lying on
the steppe, and sues for her hand. Vladimir supports the suit,
and Nastasya is constrained to accept this prohibited husband.
Dobrynya's horse [two doves, a pilgrim] reveals to his master
what is going on, and carries him home with marvellous speed. Do
brynya gains admittance to the wedding-feast in the guise of a
merry-maker, and so pleases Vladimir with his singing that he is
allowed to sit where he likes. He places himself opposite
Nastasya, drops his ring in a cup, and asks her to drink to him.
She finds the ring in the bottom, falls at his feet and implores
pardon.=<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_019','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Wollner, Volksepik der Grossrussen, p. 122 f; Rambaud,

<p>We have the ring employed somewhat after the fashion of these
western tales in Somadeva's story of Vidushaka. The Vidyudharl
Bbadra, having to part for a while with Vidushaka, for whom she
had conceived a passion, gives him her ring. Subsequently,
Vidushaka obliges a rakshas whom he has subdued to convey him to
the foot of a mountain on which Bhadra had taken refuge. Many
beautiful girls come to fetch water in golden pitchers from a
lake, and, on inquiring, Vidushaka finds that the water is for
Bhadra. One of the girls asks him to lift her pitcher on to her
shoulder, and while doing this he drops into the pitcher Bhadra's
ring. When the water is poured on Bhadra's hands, the ring falls
out. Bhadra asks her maids if they have -seen a stranger. They
say they have seen a mortal, and that he had helped one of them
with her pitcher. They are ordered to go for the youth at once,
for he is Bhadra's consort.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d017_020','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>According to the letter of the ballads, should the ring given
Horn by his lady turn wan or blue, this would signify that she
loved another man: but though accuracy would be very desirable in
such a case, these words are rather loose, since she never
faltered in her love, and submitted to marry another, so far as
she submitted, only under constraint. 'Horn Child,' sts 48, 71,
agrees with the ballads as to this point. We meet a ring of
similar virtue in 'Bonny Bee-Horn,' Jamieson's Popular Ballads,
1, 187, and Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 169.</p>

<p>'But gin this ring should fade or fail,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or the stone should change its hue,<br/>
Be sure your love is dead and gone,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or she has proved untrue.'<br/>

<p>In the Roumanian ballad, 'Ring and Handkerchief,' a prince
going to war gives his wife a ring: if it should rust, he is
dead. She gives him a gold-embroidered handkerchief: if the gold
melts, she is dead. Alecsandri, Poesi&#301; pop. ale
Rom&acirc;nilor, p. 20, No 7; Stanley, Rouman Anthology, p. 16,
p. 193. In Gonzenbach's Sicilianische M&auml;rchen, I, 39, No 7, a
prince, on parting with his sister, gives her a ring, saying, So
long as the stone is clear, I am well: if it is dimmed, that is a
sign that I am dead. So No 5, at p. 23. A young man, in a
Silesian story, receives a ring from his sweetheart, with the
assurance that he can count upon her faith as long as the ring
holds; and after twenty years' detention in the mines of Siberia,
is warned of trouble by the ring's breaking: Goedsche,
Schlesischer Sagen- Historien- u. Legendenschatz, I, 37, No 16.
So in some copies of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_93.html">Lamkin</a>,' the lord has a foreboding that
some ill has happened to his lady from the rings on his fingers
