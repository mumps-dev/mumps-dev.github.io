<p>A copy of this ballad in Dryden's Miscellany, III, 312, 1716,
agrees with the one in Wit and Drollery. That in Ritson's Select
Collection of English Songs, II, 215, 1783, agrees with Dryden's
save in two or three words. The broadside <b>C</b> <b>a</b> was
printed for Henry Gosson, who is said by Chappell to have
published from 1607 to 1641. If the lower limit be correct, this
is the earliest impression known.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d081_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The other broadsides,
<b>C</b> <b>b</b>-<b>e</b>, are later, but all of the seventeenth
century. Percy inserted the ballad in his Reliques, III, 67,
1765, making a broadside in the British Museum his basis, and
correcting as usual.</p>

<p>Percy remarks: This ballad is ancient, and has been popular;
we find it quoted in many old plays. Cases cited by him are:
Beaumont and Fletcher's Knight of the Burning Pestle, V, 3, Dyce
II, 223, of about 1611:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>And some they whistled, and some they sung,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hey down, down<br/>
And some did loudly say,<br/>
Ever as the lord Barnet's horn blew,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Away, Musgrave, away!</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Again, Sir William Davenant's play 'The Wits,' where Sir
Thwack boasts, "I sing Musgrove, and for the Chevy Chase no lark
comes near me," Act III, p. 194, of ed. 1672; and 'The Varietie,'
a comedy, Act IV, 1649. In Beaumont and Fletcher's 'Bonduca,' V,
2, Dyce, V, 88, dating before March, 1619, we find this stanza,
which is perhaps A 26, loosely remembered:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>She set the sword unto her breast,<br/>
Great pity it was to see<br/>
That three drops of her life-warm blood<br/>
Run trickling down her knee.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>And two stanzas in Fletcher's 'Monsieur 
Thomas,' IV, 11, Dyce VII, 375, earlier than 
1639, may well be <b>A</b> 11, 12 parodied:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>If this be true, thou little tiny page,<br/>
This tale that thou tellst me,<br/>
Then on thy back will I presently hang<br/>
A handsome new livery.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>But if this be false, thou little tiny page,<br/>
As false it well may be,<br/>
Then with a cudgel of four foot long<br/>
I'll beat thee from head to toe.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Jamieson says, in a prefatory note to F, that he had heard
'Little Musgrave' repeated, with very little variation, both in
Morayshire and the southern counties of Scotland. All the
Scottish versions are late, and to all seeming derived,
indirectly or immediately, from print,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d081_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> As a recompense we
have a fine ballad upon the same theme, '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_82.html">The Bonny Birdy</a>,' which
is not represented in England.</p>

<p>In the English broadside and most of the northern versions the
lovers try a bribe, a threat, or both, to make the page keep
counsel. In some of these Musgrave, when detected, ejaculates a
craven imprecation of woe to the fair woman that lies in his arms
asleep, <b>G</b> 23, <b>H</b> 16, <b>I</b> 14, <b>J</b> 20,
<b>L</b> 37. In <b>I</b> the men are brothers; in <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b> Musgrave has a wife of his own; in <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>
Lord Barnard kills himself; in <b>B</b> he is hanged! None of
these divergences from the story as we have it in <b>A</b> are
improvements, but it is an improvement that the lady should die
by stroke of steel as in <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>J</b>,
<b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, in exchange for the barbarity of <b>A</b>.
The penance in <b>L</b> is a natural and common way of ending
such a tragedy. The collecting of the lady's heart's blood in a
basin of pure silver, <b>G</b> 28-30, is probably borrowed from
'Lammikin,' where this trait is very effective.</p>

<p>The heathen child, <b>B</b> 13<sup>1</sup>, is a child
unchristened. An unbaptized child seems still to be called so in
Norway, and so is a woman between childbirth and churching. In
modern Icelandic usage a boy or girl before confirmation is
called heathen, from confusion between baptism and confirmation:
Ivar Aasen, at the word heiden; Vigfusson, at the word
hei&eth;inn.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d081_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

And stripped it athwart the straw,</td></tr>

<p>explains a corruption in <b>E</b> 18<sup>2</sup>, where the
manuscript reads, He 's struck <i>her</i> in the straw, and
another in <b>J</b> 9. The sword is wiped or whetted on straw in
