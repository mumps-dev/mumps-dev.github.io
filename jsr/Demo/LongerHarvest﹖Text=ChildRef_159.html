<h3>Durham Field</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Durham ffeilde,' Percy Manuscript, p. 245; Hales and Furnivall,
II, 190. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d15901.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>While Edward Third was absent in France, and for the time
engaged with the siege of Calais, David Bruce, the young king of
Scotland, at the instance of Philip of Valois, but also because
he "yearned to see fighting," invaded England with a large army.
Having taken by storm the Border castle of Liddel, he was advised
by William of Douglas to turn back, which, it was represented by
Douglas, he could do with credit after this success. Other lords
said that Douglas had filled his bags, but theirs were toom, and
that the way lay open to London, for there were no men left in
England but souters, skinners, and traders.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d159_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The Scots moved
on to Durham, and encamped in a park not far from the town, in a
bad position. In the mean while a powerful force had been
collected by the northern nobility and the English churchmen,
without the knowledge of the Scots. William of Douglas, going out
to forage, rode straight to the ground where his foes lay, and in
the attempt to retreat lost five hundred of his men. King David
drew up his army in three divisions: one under his own command,
another under the Earl of Murray and William Douglas, the third
under the Steward of Scotland and the Earl of March. The
operations of the Scots were impeded by the ditches and fences
that traversed the ground on which they stood, and their
situation made them an almost helpless mark for the ten thousand
archers of the English army. Murray's men were completely routed
by a charge of cavalry, and their leader killed. The English then
fell upon the King's division, which, after a desperate fight,
was "vanquished utterly." David, who had received two wounds from
arrows, was taken prisoner by John Copland, "by force, not
yolden," after knocking out two of the Englishman's teeth with a
knife. Wyntoun's Chronykil, ed. Laing, II, 470 ff;
Scotichronicon, ed. Goodall, II, 339 ff. The battle was fought on
the 17th of October, 1346.</p>

<p>According to the English chronicle of Lanercost, John of
Douglas, 'germanus domini Willelmi,' fought with the Earl of
Murray in the first Scottish division, and the Earl of Buchan was
associated with King David in the command of the second. The
English were also in three bodies. The leaders of the first were
the Earl of Angus, 'inter omnes Angli&aelig; nobilis persona,'
Henry Percy, Ralph Neville, and Henry Scrope; the Archbishop of
York led the second; Mowbray, Rokeby, and John of Copland were in
the third. Ed. Stevenson, pp. 349-51.</p>

<p>David, in the ballad, proposes to himself nothing less than
the conquest of England and the distribution of the territory
among his chief men. He is not a youth of twenty-two; William
Douglas has served him four and thirty years. Still he will brook
no advice, and kills his own squire for warning him of the danger
of his enterprise. The Earl of Angus is to lead the van; but
Angus, as we have seen, was engaged on the other side. The title
of Angus might have deceived the minstrel, but it was hardly to
be expected that Neville should be turned into a Scot as he is in
st. 17. Angus, and also 'Vaughan,' that is Baughan, or
Buchan,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d159_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> are to be in the king's coat-armor, sts 11, 13,
imitating Blunt and the rest at Shrewsbury, and the five false
Richmonds at Bosworth. James<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d159_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Douglas offers to lead the van,
14; so does William Douglas in 21. An Englishman who does not
know a Neville would surely not be very precise about a Douglas,
and it must be conceded that the Douglases have not always been
kept perfectly distinct by historians. James Douglas, whoever he
may be supposed to be, "went before;" that is, he plays the part
which belongs historically to the Knight of Liddesdale, loses all
his men, and returns, with an arrow in his thigh, to report that
one Englishman is worth five Scots: 26-33.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d159_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> But the Scots,
even at that rate, have the advantage, for a herald, sent out to
reconnoitre, tells their king that they are ten to one.</p>

<p>The commanders on the English side are the Bishop of Durham,
Earl Percy, the Archbishop of York, the Bishop of Carlisle, and
"Lord Fluwilliams."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d159_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The Bishop of Durham orders that no man
shall fight before he has 'served his God,' and five hundred
priests say mass in the field who afterwards take part in the
fray. (The monks of Durham, Knyghton tells us, had made terms
with the Scots, and were to pay a thousand pounds for
ransom-money the next day; and so, when they saw the Scots
yielding, they raised their voices in a Te Deum, which sounded to
the clouds and quickened the courage of the English.) The king of
Scots is wounded by an arrow through his nose, and, stepping
aside to bleed, is taken prisoner by John of Copland, whom he
first smites angrily. Copland sets the king on a palfrey and
leads him to London. King Edward, newly arrived from France, asks
him how he likes the shepherds, millers, and priests. There 's
not a yeoman in England, says David, but he is worth a Scottish
knight. Aye, says King Edward, laughing, that is because you were
fighting against the right. Shortly after this the Black Prince
brings the king of France captive from the field of Poitiers.
Says David to John, Welcome, brother, but I would I had gone to
Rome! And I, would I had gone to Jerusalem! replies John. Thus
ends the battle of Durham, fought, says the minstrel, on a
morning of May, sts 27, 64, and within the same month as the
battles of Cr&eacute;cy and Poitiers.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d159_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Though Poitiers was
fought ten years after Durham, the king of Scots and the king of
France no doubt met in London, for John was taken thither in
April, 1357, and David was not released from his captivity until
the following November.</p>

<p>Stanza 18 affords us an upper limit for a date. Lord Hambleton
is said to be of the king's kin full nigh. James Hamilton, the
first lord, married the princess Mary, sister of James III, in
1474, and his descendants were the next heirs to the throne after
the Stewarts, whose line was for a time but barely kept up.</p>
