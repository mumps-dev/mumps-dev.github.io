<p><b>A</b> was printed in Percy's Reliques, III, 58, ed. 1765,
with comparatively few changes. <b>B</b> <b>a</b> was published
by Jamieson, from Mrs. Brown's manuscript, in his Popular
Ballads, I, 113, with some slight variation from the text, many
acknowledged interpolations, and the addition of three
sentimental stanzas to make Burd Ellen die just as her enduring
all things is to be rewarded. In this tragic close, Jamieson was
anticipated by Mrs. Hampden Pye, in her 'Earl Walter,' 1771,
Evans's Old Ballads, II, 208, 1777. <b>C</b> is given as it
appears in Kinloch's annotated copy of his Ancient Scottish
Ballads, where ten stanzas are inserted to enlarge and complete
the copy published in 1827. This enlarged copy was communicated
to Chambers, and seven of the supplementary stanzas were
introduced into his compilation, The Scottish Ballads, p. 193.
These supplementary stanzas, some of them certainly, and we may
suppose all, belonged to a copy of which only the concluding
portion, here given as <b>D</b>, is elsewhere preserved.</p>

<p>The variations in the several versions of this charming
ballad, which has perhaps no superior in English, and if not in
English perhaps nowhere,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d063_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> are not material, and the story may
tberefore be given as it runs in <b>A</b>, the oldest copy. Fair
Ellen comes to Child Waters, and tells him that her gown, which
was too wide, is now too narrow. He bids her be content and take
two shires of land; she would rather have one kiss from his mouth
than Cheshire and Lancashire both. He must ride far into the
North the next day; she asks to be his foot-page. This she may be
if she will shorten her gown and clip her locks, so as not to be
known for a woman. He rides hard all day, and she keeps up with
him barefoot. They come to a broad piece of salt water; he lets
her get through as she can, but Our Lady bears up her chin. Then
he points out a splendid ball, where are four and twenty ladies,
and the fairest is his love and wife. God give both good! is all
she says. Arrived there, Ellen takes his horse to the stable. At
bed-time he sends her to the town, to bring him the fairest lady
that can be found, to sleep in his arms, and to bring this lady
in <i>her</i> arms, for filing of her feet. Ellen lies at the
foot of the bed, for want of other place, and before dawn is
roused by Child Waters to feed his horse. The pains of travail
come on her in the stable; Child Waters' mother hears her moans,
and bids him get up. He stands at the stable-door and listens.
Ellen sings:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right">~~ &nbsp;</td>
<td>Lullaby, dear child, dear!<br/>
I would thy father were a king,<br/>
Thy mother laid on a bier!</td></tr>

</table>

<p>This moves even his sturdy heart; he tells Ellen to be of good
cheer, for the bridal and the churching shall both be on one
day.</p>

<p>In <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>
the man relents so far as, when they are in the water, to ask her
to ride. She will not, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>; he takes her
on at a stone which stands in the middle of the stream, <b>B</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>J</b>. The stream is Clyde in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>J</b>; the Tay in <b>I</b>. In <b>C</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b> he tells her after they have passed
the water, that it is three and thirty miles to his house; a
(poetically) superfluous and meddling parrot says it is but
three. In <b>C</b>, <b>G</b> he tells her that she will have a
serving-man for a husband, and in <b>H</b> that he has already
wife and bairns.</p>

<p>One stroke in <b>A</b>, the sending of Ellen to fetch a woman
from the town, is wanting in the other versions, decidedly to
their advantage. This exaggeration of insult, submitting to which
only degrades the woman, is paralleled, though not quite reached,
by the paramour in the forest in the otherwise exquisitely
refined tale of The Nut-Brown Maid. As for the ballad, the
disagreeable passage may be an insertion of some unlucky singer,
and the perfect truth to nature and remarkably high taste of The
Nut-Brown Maid, in every other particular, would almost drive us
to assume an interpolation in this case too.</p>

<p><b>E</b> 1, 2, 16, <b>F</b> 2, 3 show contact with the ballad
of 'Lizzie Lindsay; ' the passing of the water, particularly in
<b>E</b> 8-12, with 'The Knight and Shepherd's Daughter;' and
again, <b>H</b> 21.</p>

<p>An exceedingly popular Scandinavian ballad is manifestly of
the same source, though the story is told in a very different
way, the cruel trials to which the woman's love is put being
entirely lacking: Danish, 'Jomfru og Stalddreng,' Grundtvig, V,
171, No 267, <b>A</b>-<b>A</b>. <b>Swedish</b>, <b>A</b>, 'Liten
Kerstin Stalldr&auml;ng,' Afzelius, II, 15, No 33; <b>B</b>,
'Stolts Botelid Stalldr&auml;ng,' Afzelius, II, 20, No 34;
<b>C</b>-<b>E</b>, 'Liten Kerstin Stalldr&auml;ng,' Arwidsson,
II, 179, No 109, Hofberg's Nerikes gamla Minnen, p. 254.
&Ouml;berg in Aminson, 1,28; <b>F</b>-<b>I</b>, from Cavallius
and Stephens's manuscript collection, Grundtvig, V, 217 f;
<b>J</b>, 'Liten Kerstin och Dane-Peter,' Wigstr&ouml;m,
Folkdiktning, I, 66, No 32. <b>Norwegian</b>, <b>A</b>, 'Liti
Kersti som stalldreng,' Landstad, p. 605, No 78;
<b>B</b>-<b>E</b>, Grundtvig, V, 218-20; <b>F</b>, Landstad, p.
605, note. (Several of these are only a verse or two.) Danish
<b>A</b>-<b>F</b> are from manuscripts of the sixteenth or
seventeenth century; <b>G</b> was printed at the end of the
seventeenth; the other copies are from recent tradition, but
nevertheless point to a higher antiquity than those which were
taken down earlier. There is naturally much variation in details
among so many copies, and it will be sufficient to indicate the
general character of the story. A young woman, who may be called
Kirstin, clips her hair and puts on man's clothes, seeks service
at court, and is taken as stable-boy, at the instance of a man
(often the king's son, or of other high rank) who may be called
Peter, with whom she, in some copies, seems to have had a
previous connection. Peter, as an accommodation, lets the
stable-boy sleep with him. In the course of time Kirstin cannot
do duty any more, cannot buckle on spurs, is ill and requires
woman's assistance, which the queen renders. She gives birth to
twins in the stable (among the horses' legs, as in English,
<b>B</b> 30, <b>F</b> 30). A merry wedding follows.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d063_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Another Scandinavian ballad has a limited resemblance to
'Child Waters:' <b>Danish</b>, 'Den trofaste Jomfru,' Grundtvig,
IV, 494, No 249, <b>A</b>-<b>I</b>; 'Den fredlose,' Kristensen,
II, 191, No 57 (A-C), <b>J</b>-<b>L</b>. <b>Swedish</b>,
<b>A</b>, 'De Sju Gullbergen,' Afzelius, III, 71, No 79;
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, from Cavallius and Stephens's collection,
Grundtvig, IV, 507 f. <b>Norwegian</b>, <b>A</b>, 'Herre Per og
stolt Margit,' Landstad, p. 590, No 74; <b>B</b>, Herr' Nikelus,
Landstad, p. 594, No 75. The ballad begins like Danish 'Ribold og
Guldborg' and 'Kvindemorderen.' A knight carries off a maid,
making her fine promises, among which gold castles commonly
figure. He takes her over a very wide piece of water, an arm of
the sea, on his horse in most versions; in Danish <b>B</b>,
<b>K</b> they swim it. When they come to land, she asks where are
the promised castles? Danish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>J</b>,
<b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. He tells her
that he is a penniless outlaw (wanting in Swedish <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>); she offers the gold she has brought with her to buy
him his peace (wanting in Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, Norwegian
<b>B</b>). He tells her he has another love; she is willing to be
their servant (wanting in Danish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>I</b>, Norwegian <b>B</b>). Here he ceases his trial of her;
he is a royal, or very opulent, person, she is to have a troop of
servants, the castles are not in the air, and all ends
happily.</p>

<p>Percy's edition of <b>A</b> is translated (freely) by
B&uuml;rger, 'Graf Walter,' and B&uuml;rger's version is
revised, to bring it slightly nearer the original, by Bothe,
Volkslieder, p. 199. Percy is translated by Bodmer, I, 41.
<b>I</b> is translated by Gerhard, p. 117, and Aytoun's
compilation, I, 239, by Knortz, Schottische Balladen, p. 11. The
Danish ballad is translated by Prior, III, 25, after Danske
Viser, IV, 116, Syv, Fourth Part, No 31, Grundtvig's <b>G</b>
<b>c</b>.</p>
