<p>An old farmer who is on his way to pay his rent imparts the
fact to a gentlemanlike highwayman who overtakes him. The
highwayman cautions him not to be too communi- cative, since
there are many thieves on the roads. The old man has no fear; his
money is safe in his saddle-bags. At the right time and place the
thief bids him stand and deliver. The farmer throws his saddle
over a hedge; the thief dismounts to fetch it, and gives his
horse to the farmer to hold; the farmer mounts the thief's horse
and rides off. The thief hacks the saddle to pieces to get at the
bags. Arrived at his landlord's, the farmer opens the thief's
portmanteau, and finds in it six hundred pounds. The farmer's
wife is made very happy by her husband's report of his
performances; the thief's money will help to enlarge her
daughter's marriage portion.</p>

<p>This very ordinary ballad has enjoyed great popularity, and is
given for that reason and as a specimen of its class. There is an
entirely similar one, in which a Norfolk (Rygate, Cheshire)
farmer's daughter going to market to sell corn is substituted for
the farmer going to pay his rent: 'The Norfolk Maiden,' in The
Longing Maid's Garland, of the last century, without place or
date;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d283_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> 'The Maid of Rygate,' Logan's Pedlar's Pack, p. 133;
The Highwayman Outwitted,' Leigh's Ballads and Legends of
Cheshire, p. 267. Another variety is of a Yorkshire boy sent to a
fair to sell a cow: 'Yorkshire Bite,' etc., The Turnip-Sack
Garland (like The Longing Maid's Garland, one of a collection of
Heber's);<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d283_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> 'The Yorkshire Bite,' "from a collection of

<p>For certain ballads in which a country girl, beset by an
amorous gentleman, mounts his horse and makes off with his valise
or the like, see II, 483, and the page preceding.</p>

<p>'The Politick Squire, or, The Highwaymen catch'd in their own
play,' is a ballad of a gentleman who, having been robbed by five
highwaymen that then purpose to shoot him, tells them that he is
the Pretender, and is taken by them as such to a justice. The
squire makes explanations, four of the thieves are hanged, and
the fifth, who had shown some mercy, is transported,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d283_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
