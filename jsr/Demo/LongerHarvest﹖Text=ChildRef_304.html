<h3>Young Ronald</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 282;
Motherwell's Manuscript, p. 601, derived from Buchan. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d30401.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Young Ronald, a noble squire, but still school-boy (11, 29),
lays his love on the daughter of the king of Linne, a locality
which, as it occurs several times in ballads, we are glad to
learn is not far from Windsor. In the course of an interview with
the lady in her garden, she tells him that though she entirely
feels the honor he has done her, she must be subject to her
father's will. Ronald's father and mother are greatly concerned
for their son, seeing that the lady lias already rejected many
suitors. He pays his love a second visit, and protests that for
her sake he would fight long and hard. Be not too hasty, she
answers; you must buckle with a more dangerous foe than you wot
of, ere you win me by war. She proceeds to explain that her
father will have to go to war the next day with a giant who has
been very troublesome, and then to make him various offers with
the view of enlisting him in the affair; among which are two
standard rings, one of which will stanch the blood of any of his
men who may be hurt, the other prevent the drawing of his own
blood.</p>

<p>Young Ronald reports to his father the encouragement which he
has received from his love, the impending contest with the giant,
and the gifts which she has made him; and the father, on his
part, promises him a company of a hundred well-armed men.
Supported by these, and invigorated by a third meeting in the
garden, Ronald rides proudly to the field. The giant, who is
handicapped with three heads on his neck, and three more on his
breast, challenges the king of Linne to combat, and the king
offers his daughter and a third of his lands to any champion who
will undertake the giant. Ronald is ready, and, according to the
rule in such cases, disdains the offer of any reward but the
daughter. The thought of her gives him a lion's courage, and such
potency to his arm that he cuts off all the six heads of the
giant at one sweep.</p>

<p>If any lover of ballads should feel his understanding insulted
by the presentation of such a piece as this, I can have no
quarrel with him. There is certainly much in it that is
exasperating, the greeters in the school, the lifting of the hat,
and, most of all, perhaps, the mint in meadows. These are,
however, the writer's own property; the nicking with nay and the
giant are borrowed from romances. In this and not a very few
other cases, I have suppressed disgust, and admitted an actually
worthless and a manifestly at least in part spurious ballad,
because of a remote possibility that it might contain relics, or
be a debased representative, of something genuine and better.
Such was the advice of my lamented friend, Grundtvig, in more
instances than those in which I have brought myself to defer to
his judgment.</p>
