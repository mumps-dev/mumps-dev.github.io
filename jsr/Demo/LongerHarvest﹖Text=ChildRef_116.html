<p>Adam Bell, Clim of the Clough, and William of Cloudesly,
outlawed for breach of the game-laws, swear brotherhood, and
betake themselves to Inglewood, a forest adjacent to Carlisle.
William is a wedded man, and one day tells his brethren that he
means to go to Carlisle to see his wife and children. Adam would
not advise this, lest he should be taken by the justice. William
goes to Carlisle, nevertheless, knocks at his window, and is
admitted by Alice, his wife, who tells him with a sigh that the
place has been beset for him a half year and more. While they
make good cheer, an old woman, whom William had kept seven years
for charity, slips out, and informs the justice that William is
come to town.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The justice and the sheriff come presently
with a great rout to take William. Man and wife defend the house
till it is set on fire. William lets his wife and children down
with sheets, and shoots on till his bowstring is burnt, then runs
into the thick of his foes with sword and buckler, but is felled
by doors and windows thrown on him, and so taken. The sheriff
orders the gates of Carlisle to be shut close, and sets up a
gallows to hang William. A boy, friendly to the family, gets out
at a crevice in the wall, and carries word to Adam and Clim, who
instantly set out for the rescue. </p>

<p>Adam and Clim find the gates shut so fast that there is no
chance of getting in without a stratagem. Adam has a fair written
letter in his pocket: they will make the porter think that they
have the king's seal. They beat on the gate till the porter
comes, and demand to be let in as messengers from the king to the
justice. The porter demurs, but they browbeat him with the king's
seal; he opens the gate; they wring his neck and take his keys.
First bending their bows and looking to the strings, they make
for the market-place, where they find Cloudesly lying in a cart,
on the point to be hanged. William sees them, and takes hope.
Adam makes the sheriff his mark, Clim the justice; both fall,
deadly wounded; the citizens fly; the outlaws loose Cloudesly's
ropes. William wrings an axe from the hand of an officer, and
smites on every side; Adam and Clim shoot till their arrows are
gone, then draw their swords. Horns are blown, and the bells rung
backwards; the mayor of Carlisle comes with a large force, and
the fight is hotter than ever. But all for naught, for the
outlaws get to the gates, and are soon in Inglewood, under their
trysty-tree.</p>

<p>Alice had come to Inglewood to make known to Adam and Clim
what had befallen her husband, but naturally had not found them,
since they were already gone to William's rescue. A woman is
heard weeping, and Cloudesly, taking a turn to see what this may
mean, comes upon his wife and three boys. Very sad she is, but
the sight of her husband makes all well. Three harts are killed
for supper, and William gives Alice the best for standing so
boldly by him. The outlaws determine to go to the king to get a
charter of peace. William takes his eldest son with him, leaving
Alice and the two younger at a nunnery. The three brethren make
their way to the king's presence, without leave of porter or
announcement by usher, kneel down and hold up their hands, and
ask grace for having slain the king's deer. The king inquires
their names, and when he hears who they are says they shall all
be hanged, and orders them into arrest. Adam Bell once more asks
grace, since they have come to the king of their free will, or
else that they may go, with such weapons as they have, when they
will ask no grace in a hundred years. The king replies again that
all three shall be hanged. Hereupon the queen reminds the king
that when she was wedded he had promised to grant the first boon
she should ask; she had hitherto asked nothing, but now begs the
three yeomen's lives. The king must needs consent.</p>

<p>Immediately thereafter comes information that the outlaws had
slain the justice and the sheriff, the mayor of Carlisle, all the
constables and catchpolls, the sergeants of the law, forty
foresters, and many more. This makes the king so sad that he can
eat no more; but he wishes to see these fellows shoot that have
wrought all this woe. The king's archers and the queen's go to
the butts with the three yeomen, and the outlaws hit everything
that is set up. Cloudesly holds the butts too wide for a good
archer, and the three set up two hazel rods, twenty score paces
apart; he is a good archer, says Cloudesly, that cleaves one of
these. The king says no man can do it; but Cloudesly cleaves the
wand. The king declares him the best archer he ever saw. William
says he will do a greater mastery: he will lay an apple on his
son's head (a boy of seven), and split it in two at six score
paces. The king bids him make haste so to do: if he fail, he
shall be hanged; and if he touch the boy, the outlaws shall be
hanged, all three. Cloudesly ties the child to a stake, turning
its face from him, sets an apple on its head, and, begging the
people to remain quiet, cleaves the apple in two. The king gives
Cloudesly eighteen pence a day as his bowman, and makes him chief
rider over the North Country. The queen adds twelve pence, makes
him a gentleman of cloth and fee and his two brothers yeomen of
her chamber, gives the boy a place in her wine-cellar, and
appoints Alice her chief gentlewoman and governess of her
nursery. The yeomen express their thanks, go to Rome [to some
bishop, in the later copy] to be absolved of their sins, live the
rest of their lives with the king, and die good men, all
three.</p>

<p>The rescue of Robin Hood by Little John and Much in No 117,
sts 61-82, has a general resemblance to the rescue of Cloudesly
by Adam and Clim in this ballad, st. 52 ff. The rescue of Will
Stutly has also some slight similarity: cf. No 141, sts 26-33,
and 70, 79-81, of 'Adam Bell.'</p>

<p>The shooting of an apple from a boy's head, sts 151-62, is, as
is well known, a trait in several German and Norse traditions,
and these particular feats, as well as everything resembling
them, have been a subject of eager discussion in connection with
the apocryphal history of William Tell.</p>

<p>The Icelandic saga of Dietrich of Bern, compiled, according to
the prologue, from Low German tales and ballads, narrates that
young Egil, a brother of Weland the Smith, came to Nidung's court
with the fame of being the best bowman in the world. Nidung, to
prove his skill, required Egil [on pain of death] to shoot an
apple from the head of his son, a child of three years, only one
trial being permitted. Egil split the apple in the middle. Though
allowed but one chance, Egil had provided himself with three
arrows. When asked why, he answered the king that the two others
were meant for him, if he had hit the boy with the first. Saga
&ETH;i&eth;riks Konungs af Bern, ed. linger, c. 75, p. 90 f;
Peringski&ouml;ld, Wilkina Saga, c. 27, p. 63 f; Raszmann, Die
Deutsche Heldensage, II, 247 f; the Swedish rifacimento, Sagan om
Didrik af Bern, ed. Hylt&eacute;n-Cavallius, c. 73, p. 54. The
Icelandic saga was composed about 1250.</p>

<p>Saxo, writing about 1200, relates nearly the same incidents of
Toko, a man in the service of King Harold Bluetooth (&#8224; c.
985). Toko, while drinking with comrades, had bragged that he was
good enough bowman to hit the smallest apple on top of a stick at
the first shot. This boast was carried to the king, who exacted a
fulfilment of it on pain of death; but the apple was to be set on
the head of Toko's son. The father exhorted the boy to stand
perfectly still, and, to make this easier, turned the child's
face from the direction of the shot; then, laying out three
arrows from his quiver, executed the required feat. When the king
asked why he had taken three arrows, Toko replied, To wreak the
miss of the first with the points of the others. Saxo
Grammaticus, Gesta Danorum, Book x, ed. Holder, p. 329 f.</p>

<p>The White Book of Obwalden, written about 1470, informs us
that Tell, a good archer, having refused to bow to Gesler's hat,
was ordered by the landvogt to shoot an apple from the head of
one of his children. Unable to resist, Tell laid-by a second
arrow, shot the apple from the child's head, and being asked why
he had reserved the other arrow, replied that if the first had
missed he would have shot Gesler or one of his men with the
second.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>This story is introduced into a piece of verse on the origin
of the Swiss confederacy, of nearly the same date as the prose
document. In this the landvogt says to Tell that if he does not
hit with the first shot, it will cost him his life; the distance
is one hundred and twenty paces, as in the English ballad, and
Tell says simply that he would have shot the landvogt if he had
hit his son.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> (Tell uses a cross-bow, not the long-bow, as
the English.)</p>

<p>Henning Wulf, a considerable person in Holstein, who had
headed an unsuccessful outbreak against Christian the First of
Denmark, was captured and brought before the king. The king,
knowing Henning to be an incomparable archer, ordered him to
shoot an apple from the head of his only son, a child: if he
succeeded, he was to go free. The exploit was happily
accomplished. But Henning had put a second arrow into his mouth,
and the king asked the object. The second arrow was for the king,
had the boy been hit. Henning Wulf was outlawed. The story, which
is put at 1472, is the subject of a painting preserved in a
church.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The Norwegian king, Haraldr Har&eth;r&aacute;&eth;r (&#8224;
1066), who has a grudge against Hemingr, son of
&Aacute;sl&aacute;kr, undertakes to put him to proof in shooting,
swimming, and snow-shoe sliding. They go to a wood, and both
execute extraordinary feats with bow and lance; but Hemingr is
much superior to the king. The king orders Hemingr to shoot a nut
from his brother Bj&ouml;rn's head, on pain of death for missing.
Hemingr would rather die than venture such a shot; but his
brother offers himself freely, and undertakes to stand still.
Then let the king stand by Bj&ouml;rn, says Hemingr, and see
whether I hit. But the king prefers to stand by Hemingr, and
appoints somebody else to the other position. Hemingr crosses
himself, calls God to witness that the king is responsible,
throws his lance, and strikes the nut from his brother's head,
doing him no harm. Hemings &ETH;&aacute;ttr, Flateyjarb&oacute;k,
III, 405 f (1370-80); M&uuml;ller, Sagabibliothek, III, 356 ff.
This story was probably derived from an old song, and is
preserved in Norwegian and F&auml;r&ouml;e ballads: 'Harald
kongin og Hemingen unge,' Landstad, Norske Folkeviser, No 15,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, pp. 177-188; 'Geyti &Aacute;slaksson,'
Hammershaimb, F&aelig;r&ouml;iske Kv&aelig;der,No 17,
<b>A</b>-<b>C</b>, II, 149-163. In Norwegian <b>A</b>, 5-10, the
shot is exacted under pain of imprisonment. Hemingen insists that
the king shall take a place near his brother [son], whom he
exhorts to stand erect and bold; one half of the nut falls, the
other is left on the head; the king asks what was to have been
done with a second arrow which Hemingen had secreted, and is
answered as in the previous cases.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The first and last of
these incidents are wanting in <b>B</b> (19-22). In the
F&auml;r&ouml;e ballad, <b>A</b>, 53-62, the king tells Geyti
(whom he also calls Hemingur) that he must shoot a nut from his
brother's head. Geyti asks the king to go to the wood with him to
see the result, invokes God and St. Olav, hits the nut without
touching his brother. It is not till the next day that the king
asks Geyti why he had two arrows with him in the wood.</p>

<p>The same story, pleasingly varied for the occasion, is found
in the saga of the Norwegian king &Oacute;lafr Tryggvason
(&#8224; 1000). The king hears that Eindri&eth;i, a handsome,
rich, and amiable young man, is unconverted. Eindri&eth;i is a
good swimmer, bowman, and dirk-thrower. &Oacute;lafr, a
proficient in all such exercises, proposes to try masteries with
him in the feats which he has repute for, on the terms that if
Eindri&eth;i is beaten he shall be baptized, but if victor shall
hold such faith as he will. The first trial is in swimming, and
in this &Oacute;lafr shows unequivocal superiority. The next day
they shoot at a target, and the advantage, after two essays, is
rather with Eindri&eth;i. The king compliments Eindri&eth;i; but
the issue between them is not yet decided. This fine young
fellow's salvation is at stake, and expedients which one might
otherwise scruple at are justifiable. &Oacute;lafr knows that
Eindri&eth;i tenderly loves a pretty child, four or five years
old, his sister's son. This boy shall be our target, says the
king. A chessman (the king-piece) on his head shall be the mark,
to be shot off without hurting the boy. Eindri&eth;i must needs
submit, but means to have revenge if the child comes to harm. The
king orders a cloth to be passed round the boy's head, each end
of which is to be held firmly by a man, so as to prevent any
stirring when the whiz of the arrow is heard. &Oacute;lafr signs
both himself and the point of his arrow with the cross, and
shoots; the arrow takes off the chessman, passing between it and
the head, grazing the crown and drawing some little blood. The
king bids Eindri&eth;i take his turn; but Eindri&eth;i's mother
and sister beg him with tears to desist, and he, though ready to
take the risk, yields to their entreaties, and leaves the victory
with &Oacute;lafr. On the third day there is a match at a game
with dirks. For a time no one can say which does the better; but
in the end &Oacute;lafr performs feats so marvellous as in
Eindri&eth;i's conviction to demonstrate the assistance of a
deity: wherefore he consents to be baptized. Saga &Oacute;lafs
Tryggvasonar, Fornmanna S&ouml;gur, II, 259-74, c. 235;
Flateyjarb&oacute;k, I, 456-64, cc. 359-64.</p>

<p>Punker, a warlock of Rorbach (a town not far from Heidelberg),
had obtained from the devil, as the regular recompense for his
having thrice pierced the crucifix, the power of making three
unerring shots daily, and had so been able to pick off in detail
all but one of the garrison of a besieged town. To put his skill
to proof, a certain nobleman ordered him to shoot a piece of
money from his own son's head. Punker wished to be excused, for
he feared that the devil might play him false; but being induced
to make the trial, knocked the coin from the boy's cap, doing him
no damage. Before shooting, he had stuck another arrow into his
collar, and asked why, replied that if the devil had betrayed
him, and he had killed the child, he would have sent the other
bolt through the body of the person who had obliged him to
undertake the performance. Malleus Maleficarum, Pars II,
Qu&aelig;stio I, c. xvi.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The date of the transaction is put
at about 1420.</p>

<p>The last three forms of this tradition have the unimportant
variations of brother and brother, or uncle and nephew, for
father and son, and of nut, chessman, or coin for apple.</p>

<p>The story is German-Scandinavian, and not remarkably
extended.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The seven versions agree in two points: the shot
is compulsory; the archer meditates revenge in case he harms the
person on whose head the mark is placed.{13}} These features are
wanting in the English ballad. William of Cloudesly offers of his
own free motion to shoot an apple from his son's head, and this
after the king had declared him the best archer he had ever seen,
for splitting a hazel-rod at twenty score paces; so that the act
was done purely for glory. To be sure, the king threatens him
with death if he does not achieve what he has undertaken, as
death is also threatened in four of the seven German-Scandinavian
stories for refusal to try the shot or for missing; but the
threats in sts 154 f of the English ballad are a revival of the
vow in sts 119 f. Justice has been balked by the unconditional
boon granted the queen; aggravating and exasperating
circumstances have come to light since this unadvised grace was
conceded, and a hope is presented for a pretext under which the
king may still hang the outlaws, all three. The shooting of the
apple from the boy's head, isolated from any particular
connection, is perhaps all of the German-Scandinavian story that
was known to the English ballad-maker, and all minor resemblances
may well be fortuitous.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>If the shooting of an apple by somebody from somebody's head
is to be regarded as the kernel of the story, its area may then
be considerably extended.</p>

<p>Castr&eacute;n heard the following story among the Finns in
Russian Karelia. Robbers had carried a man off over a lake. The
son of the captive, a boy of twelve, followed along the other
side of the lake, threatening to shoot them if they did not let
his father go. These threats, for a time, only procured worse
treatment for the prisoner; but at last the boy was told that his
father should be released if he could shoot an arrow across the
water and split an apple laid on his father's head. This the boy
did, and his father was liberated. Castr&eacute;n's

<p>A Persian poet introduces into a work composed about 1175 this
anecdote.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A distinguished king was very fond of a beautiful
slave, so much so that he was never easy unless he was in some
way engaged with him. When the king amused himself with shooting,
this slave would tremble with fear, for the king would make his
mark of an apple placed on his favorite's head, split the apple,
and in so doing make the slave sick with alarm.</p>

<p>J. Grimm had seen a manuscript of travels in Turkey, in the
Cassel library, with a picture of an archer aiming at an apple on
a child's head. Deutsche Mythologie, I, 317, note, ed. 1875.</p>

<p>With regard to the Persian story, Benfey observes that it must
be admitted as possible that the shooting of an apple from the
head of a beloved person may have been pitched upon in various
localities, independently, as the mark of supreme skill in
archery, but that this is not likely, and that the history of
tradition requires us rather to presume that the conception was
original in one instance only, and borrowed in the remainder; in
which case the borrowing would be by the West from the East, and
not the other way. We can come to no decision, however, he adds,
until the source of the Persian story, or some older form of it,
shall have been discovered. (G&ouml;ttinger Gelehrte Anzeigen,
1861, p. 680.) The cautiousness of the imperial scholar is worthy
of all imitation. The Persian saga, as it is sometimes called,
is, in the perhaps mutilated form in which we have it, an
inconsistent and inept anecdote; the German-Scandinavian saga is
a complete and rational story. In this story it is fundamental
that the archer executes a successful shot under circumstances
highly agitating to the nerves; he risks the life of a beloved
object, and in the majority of versions his own life is at stake
besides. That the act must be done under compulsion is the
simplest corollary. If the archer is cool enough to volunteer the
shot, then the chief difficulty in making it is removed. This is
a fault in the English ballad, where the father is unconcerned,
and all the feeling is shown by the spectators. Cloudesly had
already split a hazel-rod at twenty score paces; what was it for
him to hit an apple at six score?<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_016','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>But we are still far from covering the range of stories which
have been treated as having some significant relation to that of
Egil. Any shot at an apple, any shot at an object on a child's
person (provided the case be not a fact and recent), has been
thought worth quoting, as a probable sprout from the same root.
For examples: In an Esthonian popular tale, one Sharpeye hits an
apple which a man a long way off is holding by his mouth. In a
Servian poem, the hero, Milosch, sends an arrow through a ring,
and hits a golden apple on the point of a lance. Bellerophon's
sons, Hippolochus and Isandrus, disputing which should be king of
the Lycians, it was proposed that the question should be settled
by seeing which could shoot through a ring placed on the breast
of a child lying on his back. Laodamia, sister of the
competitors, offered her son Sarpedon for the trial, and the
uncles, to show their appreciation of such handsome behavior,
resigned their claims in favor of Sarpedon. The shot, we may
understand, did riot come off.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_017','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>With regard to all this series of stories, and others which
have been advanced as allied, more will be required to make out a
substantial relationship than their having in common a shot at
some object in contiguity with a living human body, be the object
an apple, or whatever else. The idea of thus enhancing the merit
or interest of a shot is not so ingenious that one instance must
be held to be original, and all others derivative. The archer
Alcon, according to Servius,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_018','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> was wont to shoot through
rings placed on men's heads. Sir John Malcolm (Kaye's Life, II,
400) was told that at Mocha, when the dates were ripe, a stone,
standing up some three inches, would be put on the head of a
child, at which two or three of the best marksmen would fire,
with ball, at thirty-one yards distance. A case was reported,
about fifty years ago, of a man in Pennsylvania shooting a very
small apple from the head of another man.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_019','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A linen-weaver
was judicially punished at Spires, some thirty years ago, for
shooting a sheet of paper from his son's hand, and afterwards a
potato ("also einen Erdapfel," Rochholz I) from the boy's
head.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_020','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The keel-boat men of the Mississippi, in their
playfulness, would cut the pipe out of a companion's hat-band at
a long distance. "If they quarreled among themselves, and then
made friends, their test that they bore no malice was to shoot
some small object from each other's heads," such as an apple.
Such feats have of late been common on the American stage.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of the linen-weaver at Spires, it will
scarcely be maintained that the Mississippi keel-boat men shot at
apples in imitation of William Tell. As to the selection of an
apple, it seems enough to say that an apple makes a convenient
mark, is familiar to temperate climates, and at hand at almost
any part of the year.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_021','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> But the chief point of all to be
borne in mind is, that whether the Mississippi boatmen took their
cue, directly or indirectly, from William Tell, they do not
become mythical personages by virtue of their repeating his shot.
None the more does William of Cloudesly. A story long current in
Europe, a mythical story if you please, could certainly be taken
up by an English ballad-maker without prejudice to the
substantial and simply romantic character of his hero.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_022','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The late Mr. Joseph Hunter unhesitatingly declared Adam Bell
"a genuine personage of history," and considered that he had had
"the good fortune to recover from a very authentic source of
information some particulars of this hero of our popular
minstrelsy which show distinctly the time at which he lived."</p>

<p>"King Henry the Fourth, by letters enrolled in the Exchequer,
in Trinity Term, in the seventh year of his reign [1406], and
bearing date the 14th day of April, granted to one Adam Bell an
annuity of 4<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. issuing out of the fee-farm of
Clipston, in the forest of Sherwood, together with the profits
and advantages of the vesture and herbage of the garden called
the Halgarth, in which the manor-house of Clipston is
situated.</p>

<p>"Now, as Sherwood is noted for its connection with archery,
and may be regarded also as the patria of much of the ballad
poetry of England, and the name of Adam Bell is a peculiar one,
this might be almost of itself sufficient to show that the ballad
had a foundation in veritable history. But we further find that
this Adam Bell violated his allegiance by adhering to the Scots,
the king's enemies; whereupon this grant was virtually resumed,
and the sheriff of Nottinghamshire accounted for the rents which
would have been his. In the third year of King Henry the Fifth
[1416], the account was rendered by Thomas Hercy, and in the
fourth year by Simon Leak. The mention of his adhesion to the
Scots leads us to the Scottish border, and will not leave a doubt
in the mind of the most sceptical that we have here one of the
persons, some of whose deeds (with some poetical license,
perhaps) are come down to us in the words of one of our popular
ballads." (New Illustrations of the Life, Studies, and Writings
of Shakespeare, I, 245 f, 1845.)</p>

<p>Mr. Hunter's points are, that an Adam Bell had a grant from
the proceeds of a farm in the forest of Sherwood, that Adam Bell
is a peculiar name, and that his Adam Bell adhered to the king's
enemies. To be sure, Adam Bell's retreat in the ballad is not
Sherwood, in Nottinghamshire, but Englishwood, or Inglewood, in
Cumberland (an old hunting-ground of King Arthur's, according to
several romances), a forest sixteen miles in length, reaching
from Carlisle to Penrith.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_023','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> But it would be captious to
insist upon this. Robin Hood has no connection in extant ballads
with the Cumberland forest, but Wyntoun's Scottish Chronicle, c.
1420, makes him to have frequented Inglewood as well as
Barnsdale,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_024','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The historical Adam Bell was granted an annuity,
and forfeited it for adhering to the king's enemies, the Scots;
the Adam Bell of the ballad was outlawed for breaking the
game-laws, and in consequence came into conflict with the king's
officers, but never adhered to the king's enemies, first or last,
received the king's pardon, was made yeoman of the queen's
chamber, dwelt with the king, and died a good man. Neither is
there anything peculiar in the name Adam Bell. Bell was as well
known a name on the borders<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d116_025','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> as Armstrong or Graham. There
is record of an Adam Armstrong and an Adam Graham; there is a
Yorkshire Adam Bell mentioned in the Parliamentary Writs (II,
508, 8 and 17 Edward II,) a hundred years before Hunter's
annuitant; a contemporary Adam Bell, of Dunbar, is named in the
Exchequer Rolls of Scotland under the years 1414, 1420 (IV, 198,
325); and the name occurs repeatedly at a later date in the
Registers of the Great Seal of Scotland.</p>

<p>The placability of the king in this ballad is repeated in the
Gest of Robin Hood, and is also exhibited in the Tale of Gamelyn,
where Gamelyn is made justice of all the free forest, as William
is here made chief rider over all the North Country. The king,
besides, forgives all Gamelyn's eight young men, and puts them in
good office. The king of the outlaws, in the tale, had previously
made his peace without any difficulty. Vv 888-94, 687-89.</p>
