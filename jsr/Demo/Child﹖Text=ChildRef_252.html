<p>A lady of birth falls in love with her father's kitchen-boy
(foot-boy, <b>C</b>). She makes her passion known to him. He begs
for secrecy, for her father would hang him; this is quite too
likely, and she would be sent to a nunnery. The danger quickens
her wits: she will send him off in a fine ship, and he can come
back 'like some earl or baron's son' and marry her (<b>C</b>).
Being well provided with gold, her mother's legacy, she has no
difficulty in carrying out her plan; a very noble ship is
provided, and she gives Willie (<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>) a
ring to mind him of her. She warns him, <b>C</b> 8, <b>E</b> 13,
that there are pressing reasons why he should not stay away very
long. After a voyage of from three weeks to twelve months, Willie
lands at London, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; in Spain, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. A lady, looking over her castle-wall, sees
the ship coming in, and goes down to the shore with her maries to
invite the master to dine. The master excuses himself; she asks
him if he can fancy her; the woman he loves is far over the sea;
the fairest woman in Scotland would break her heart if he should
not return to her. The Spanish (or English) lady offers him a
rich ring, to wear for her sake; he has a ring on his finger
which is far dearer than any she could give him. He sails
homeward; the lady's father sees the ship coming in, and is as
much impressed as his daughter could desire; he thinks some man
of mark must be aboard, and tells his daughter to busk herself,
for he means to ask the squire or lord to dine; he would give all
his rents to have this same marry his daughter. Willie blackens
or paints or masks or veils his face, and goes with the father to
the castle. He asks the lady if she can fancy him; her father
asks her if she will marry this lord, <b>C</b>. The man is far
over sea that shall have her love, she replies. Willie hands her
the ring which she had given him. Gat ye that by sea? or gat ye
that by land? or gat ye it on the Spanish coast upon a dead man's
hand? He gat it on a drowned man's hand. Alas! she cries, my
true-love Willie! Upon this, Willie reveals himself. The father
calls for a priest, little knowing that this lord was his own
kitchen-boy.</p>

<p>The ballad is a modern "adaptation" of 'King Horn,' No 17,
from which <b>A</b> 33, 34, <b>B</b> 47, <b>D</b> 7, 8, are taken
outright. In the particular of the hero's having his choice of
two women it is more like the gest of 'King Horn,' or 'Horn
Childe and Maiden Rimnild;' but an independent invention of the
Spanish lady is not beyond the humble ability of the composer of
'The Kitchie-Boy.'</p>
