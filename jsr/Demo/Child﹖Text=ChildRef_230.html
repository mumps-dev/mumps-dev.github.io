<h3>The Slaughter of the Laird of Mellerstain</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>In a folio volume with the title "Miscellanies,"
the last piece in the volume, Abbotsford. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d23001.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Birrel's Diary has this entry under date of January 3, 1603:
"The 3 of Januar Johne Hai[t]lie of Millstanes slaine at the Salt
Tron be Williame Home hes guidfather. This William of Ball[int]a
wes of the hous of Cowdenknowis." P. 57. In a proclamation of the
Privy Council against reset of criminals, 20th January, 1603, the
list of cases begins with "the reset of the persons who lately
most shamefully and barbarously slew the Laird of Mellestanes."
Register, VI, 525 f. There is nothing to show that these persons
were ever brought to justice, and the efforts made by the public
authorities to stop hostilities between the families concerned
were, as usual, not readily successful. April 28, 1608, the
parties to the "feud between James Haitlie, now of Mellirstanes
[son of John], and Mr. James Home of Eccles, on account of the
slaughter of John Haitlie of Mellirstanes," are ordered to appear
before the Council on the 12th of May following, to be reconciled
and to chop hands together. Register, VIII, 81 f.</p>

<p>An entry of the 4th of December, 1599, censures Sir George
Home, sheriff of Berwick, for not proceeding against "William
Home, younger, called of Coldenknowis and now of Ballinta, who
slew within the said shire Mr. Alexander Dicksoun," and was
denounced therefor 29th December, 1596. This William we may
presume to have been the undegenerate son of the William whom
Birrel calls Mellerstain's "guidfather." Register, VI, 57.</p>

<p>The lady of st. 1 was Marion Lumsden (otherwise Mariot,
Margaret), "Lady Mellirstanes," "relicta Joannis Haitlie de
Mellerstanes." Register P. C., VIII, 101, 366, Register of the
Great Seal, VI, 722. Mellerstain stands on a rising ground near
the right bank of the Eden, 1<sup>2</sup>. Cowdenknows in
3<sup>1</sup> may have been Sir John Home of Cowdenknows, named
as one of the curators of James Haitlie (a minor in 1607).
Earlstoun is not determinate. Bemerside is an alternative reading
for Earlstoun. The laird of Bemerside at the date of the
slaughter was the turbulent James Haig. The lady in st. 4 is
looking in several directions for the arrival of her husband's
body. (I have not found Fieldiesha and Yirdandstane.) The Salt
Tron is a locality of much note in the history of Edinburgh: see
Wilson's Memorials, p. 249.</p>

<p>This fragment appears to have come into Sir Walter Scott's
hands through Mr. W. Yellowlees, who filled out two of the
defective stanzas, and appended some remarks under the date of
29th October, 1828.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d230_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
