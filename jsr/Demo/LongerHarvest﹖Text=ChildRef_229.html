<p><b>A</b>. One of seven handsome sisters makes a great match
with the Earl of Crawford. In a fit of jealousy at the fondness
which he shows his young son, Ladie Lillie addresses to her
husband a quip on that head, to which the earl replies in the
same tone. But the matter does not end there. The earl sets his
wife on a horse, with her son, and sends her home to her father
at Stobhall, never to enter his gates again. Her father is
surprised that she should come without notice or attendants; she
tells him that a word from her merry mouth has parted her and her
lord. The father offers to make a better match for her; she would
not give a kiss of Crawford's for all her father's gold. She
sends a messenger to the earl to see whether he retains affection
for her; word is brought back that she is to stay with her father
and never enter Crawford's gates again. Her heart breaks. Her
father puts on black, rides to Crawford's, and finds the earl
just setting forth with a party to bring Lady Lillie home. Upon
learning that his wife is dead, the earl declares that the sun
shall nevermore shine on him.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. Lady Crawford rides to her husband's castle in
person to see if the earl will pity her. He shuts his gates and
steeks his doors, and will neither come down to speak with her
himself nor send his man. She retires weeping. The earl in turn
now goes to the castle where his lady is lying, to see if she
will pity him. She shuts the gates and steeks the doors, and will
neither come down to speak with him nor send her waiting-maid.
Not the less she takes to her bed, both she and Crawford die
before morning, and both are buried in one tomb.</p>

<p>The late Earl of Crawford recognized an agreement with fact in
some of the details of this story: Christie, I, 289. David,
eleventh earl of Crawford, who succeeded his father in 1574,
married Lilias Drummond, daughter of David, second Lord Drummond,
the Laird of Stobhall. This was considered so great a match for
the lady that a tocher was given with her "far beyond what was
customary in those times, to wit, ten thousand merks." Although
the peerages mention no children by this marriage, there is
evidence that Earl David had by Lilias "an only child, David, who
died in infancy." "These collateral verities" seemed to Earl
Crawford "to found a presumption in favor of the truth of the
main incident of the ballad." Crawford did not live at Crawford
Castle, as the ballad has it. "That place had ceased to be the
family residence for a long while. Earl David lived at Finhaven
Castle, in Angus; not too far from Stobhall to be in keeping with
the riding to and fro recorded in the ballad."</p>

<p>The first lines of the ballad are probably borrowed from
