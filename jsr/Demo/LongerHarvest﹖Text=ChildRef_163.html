<p>The copy of this ballad which was printed by Aytoun, 1858, I,
75, was derived by Lady John Scott from a friend of Mr.
Dalrymple's, and when it left Mr. Dalrymple's hands was in the
precise form of <b>A</b> <b>a</b>. Some changes were made in the
text published by Aytoun, and four stanzas, 14-16, 18, were
dropped, the first three to the advantage of the ballad, and
quite in accordance with the editor's plan. Mr. Dalrymple informs
me that in his younger days he had essayed to improve the last
two lines of stanza 7 by the change,</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>We 'd best cry in our merry men<br/>
And turn our horses' head,</td></tr>

</table>

<p>and had rearranged stanzas 18, 19, "which were absolutely
chaotic," adhering, however, closely to the sense. <b>A</b>
<b>b</b>, given in Notes and Queries, from a manuscript, as "the
original version of this ballad," exhibits the changes made by
Mr. Dalrymple, and was therefore, one would suppose, founded upon
his copy. Half a century ago the ballad was familiar to the
people, and the variations of <b>b</b>, which are not few, may be
traditional, and not arbitrary; for this reason it has been
thought best not to pass them over. The Great North of Scotland
Railway, A Guide, by W. Ferguson, Edinburgh, 1881, contains, p. 8
f, a copy which is evidently compounded from A b and Aytoun. It
adds this variation of the last stanza:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Gin ony body spier at ye<br/>
For the men ye took awa,<br/>
They 're sleepin soun and in their sheen<br/>
I the howe aneath Harlaw.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>The editor of The Thistle of Scotland treats the ballad as a
burlesque, and "not worth the attention of the public," on which
ground he refrains from printing more than three stanzas, one of
these being 15; and certainly both this and that which follows it
have a dash of the unheroic and even of the absurd. Possibly
there were others in the same strain in the version known to
Laing, but all such may fairly be regarded as wanton
depravations, of a sort which other and highly esteemed ballads
have not escaped.</p>

<p>The battle of Harlaw was fought on the 24th July, 1411. Donald
of the Isles, to maintain his claim to the Earldom of Ross,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d163_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
invaded the country south of the mountains with ten thousand
islanders and men of Ross (ravaging everywhere as he advanced) in
the hope of sacking Aberdeen, and reducing to his power the
country as far as the Tay. There was universal alarm in those
parts. He was met at Harlaw, eighteen miles northwest of
Aberdeen, by Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, and Alexander
Ogilby, sheriff of Angus, with the forces of Mar, Garioch, Angus,
and The Mearns, and his further progress was stayed. The Celts
lost more than nine hundred, the Lowlanders five hundred,
including nearly all the gentry of Buchan. (Scotichronicon, II,
444 f.) This defeat was in the interest of civilization against
savagery, and was felt, says Burton, "as a more memorable
deliverance even than that of Bannockburn." (History of Scotland,
1883, II, 394.)</p>

<p>As might be expected, the Lowlanders made a ballad about this
hard fight. 'The battel of the Hayrlau' is noted among other
popular songs, in immediate connection with 'The Hunttis of
Chevet,' by the author of The Complaint of Scotland, 1549
(Murray's edition, p. 65), but most unfortunately this ancient
song, unlike Chevy Chase, has been lost. There is a well-known
poem upon the battle, in thirty-one eight-line stanzas, printed
by Ramsay, in his Ever Green, 1724, I, 78.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d163_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> David Laing
believed that it had been printed long before. "An edition," he
says, "printed in the year 1668, was in the curious library of
old Robert Myln" (Early Metrical Tales, p. xlv.) In the catalogue
of Myln's books there is entered, apparently as one of a bundle
of pamphlets, "Harlaw, The Battle yrof, An. 1411 ... 1668,"<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d163_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
and the entry may reasonably be taken to refer to the poem
printed by Ramsay. This piece is not in the least of a popular
character. It has the same artificial rhyme as The Raid of the
Reid Swyre and The Battle of Balrinnes, but in every other
respect is prose. Mr. Norval Clyne, Ballads from Scottish
Histoiy, p. 244 ff, has satisfactorily shown that the author used
Boece's History, and even, in a way, translated some of Boece's
phrases.</p>

<p>The story of the traditional ballad is, at the start, put into
the mouth of a Highlander, who meets Sir James the Rose and Sir
John the Gryme, and is asked for information about Macdonell; but
after stanza 8, these gentlemen having gone to the field, the
narrator describes what he saw as he went on and further on. It
is somewhat surprising that John Highlandman should be strolling
about in this idle way when he should have been with Macdonell.
The narrator<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d163_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in the Ever Green poem reports at second hand:
as he is walking, he meets a man who, upon request, tells him the
beginning and the end.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d163_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Both pieces have nearly the same first
line. The borrowing was more probably on the part of the ballad,
for a popular ballad would be likely to % tell its tale without
preliminaries.</p>

<p>A ballad taken down some four hundred years after the event
will be apt to retain very little of sober history. It is almost
a matter of course that Macdonell should fall, though in fact he
was not even routed, but only forced to retire. It was vulgarly
said in Major's time that the Highlanders were beaten: they
turned and ran awa, says the ballad. Donaldum non fugarunt, says
Major, and even the ballad, inconsistently, 'Ye'd scarce known
who had won.' We are not disconcerted at the Highland force being
quintupled, or the battle's lasting from Monday morning till
Saturday gloaming: diuturna erat pugna, says Major. But the
ignoring of so marked a personage as Mar, and of other men of
high local distinction that fell in the battle,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d163_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in favor of
the Forbeses, who, though already of consequence in
Aberdeenshire, are not recorded to have taken any part in the
fight, is perhaps more than might have been looked for, and must
dispose us to believe that this particular ballad had its rise in
comparatively recent times.</p>

<p>Dunidier is a conspicuous hill on the old road to Aberdeen,
and Netherha is within two miles of it. (Overha and Netherha are
only a mile apart, and the one reading is as good as the other.)
Harlaw is a mile north from Balquhain (pronounced Bawhyne), and
precisely at a right angle to John Highlandman's route from the
West. Drumminor (to which Brave Forbes sends for his mail-coat in
stanza 15) was above twenty miles away, and the messenger would
have to pass right through the Highland army. The fact that
Drumminor ceased to be the head-castle of that powerful name in
the middle of the last century tells in some degree in favor of
the age of the ballad. (Notes of Mr. Dalrymple.)</p>

<p>"The tune to which the ballad is sung, a particularly wild and
simple one, I venture to believe," says Mr. Dairymple, "is of the
highest antiquity." A tune of The Battle of Harlaw, as Motherwell
pointed out, Minstrelsy lxii, is referred to in Polemo
Middiana;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d163_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and a "march, or rather pibroch," held to be this
same air, is given in the Lute Book of Sir William Mure of
Rowallan, p. 30, and is reproduced in Dauney's Ancient Scotish
Melodies, p. 349 (see the same work, p. 138 f, note b.) Sir
William Mure is said to have died in 1657. The Ever Green Harlaw
is adapted to an air in Johnson's Museum, No 512, and "The Battle
of Hardlaw, a pibroch," is given in Stenhouse's Illustrations,
IV, 447, 1853, "from a folio Manuscript of Scots tunes, of
considerable antiquity." This last air occurs, says Maidment, in
the rare Collection of Ancient Scots Music (c. 1776) by Daniel
Dow, "The Battle of Hara Law," p. 28: Scotish Ballads, etc., I,
200.</p>
