<p>P. 102 f. (Breton ballad), III (497 b, No 5), 508 b, IV, 464
a, V, 222 a. Add to the French ballads a copy from
Basse-Normandie obtained by M. Couraye du Parc, &Eacute;tudes
romanes d&eacute;di&eacute;es a Gaston Paris, 1891, p. 49;
'L'infidele punie,' Beauquier, Chansons p. recueillies en
Franche-Comt&eacute;, p. 254. [On the similarity of the beginning
of 'La Fidanzata Infedele' to that of the Danish ballad 'Hyrde og
Ridderfrue,' see Olrik, Ridderviser, I, 181, No 349.]</p>

<p>P. 109. Something similar to what is narrated in <b>F</b> 7-10
is, I am assured by high authorities, familiar to practising
physicians. An eminent professor in the Harvard Medical School
informs me that in the case of two families under his care the
husband has been regularly troubled with "morning sickness"
during the first three or four months of the wife's pregnancy
(the husband in neither case being of a nervous or hysterical
disposition). Mr. E.E. Griffith, late of Harvard College, tells
me that a respectable and intelligent man of his acquaintance in
Indiana maintained that he always shared the pains of his wife
during parturition, and that his labors were as intense in degree
and as long in time as hers. A distinguished physician of
Indiana, while testifying to the frequency of cases of the like
sympathy, insists that such experiences occur only to husbands
who have witnessed the pains in question, or who have learned
about them by reading or conversation on the matter, and that
"suggestion" affords an explanation of the phenomenon.</p>
