<p>42 f. A robber has his hand cut off by a girl. Later he
marries her. The day after the marriage they go on horseback to
see his relations. On coming to a wood he says, Do you remember
the night when you cut off my hand? It is now my turn. He orders
her to strip, threatening her with his dagger. When she is in her
shift, she begs him to turn away his eyes, seizes the dagger, and
cuts his throat. 'Le Voleur des Cr&ecirc;pes,' S&eacute;billot,
