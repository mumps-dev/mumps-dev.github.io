<p>The copy in Pinkerton's Tragic Ballads, 1781, p. 50, is made
up of eight stanzas of <b>D</b> and six of <b>B</b>, slightly
retouched by the editor; that in Gilchrist's collection, 1815, I,
210, is eight stanzas of <b>D</b> and nine of <b>A</b>; that in
Stenhouse's edition of Johnson's Museum, IV, 500, "communicated
by an intelligent antiquarian correspondent," is compounded from
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b> and Pinkerton, with a
little chaff of its own; that printed by W.C. Atkinson, of Brigg,
Lincolnshire, in the London Athenaeum, 1867, p. 96, is
Pinkerton's, with two trifling changes. Allen, History of the
County of Lincoln, 1834, p. 171 (repeating Wilde, Lincoln
Cathedral, 1819, p. 27, as appears from Notes and Queries, 4th
Series, II, 60), says that a complete manuscript of the ballad
was once in the library of the cathedral, and cites the first
stanza, which differs from Pinkerton's only in having "Mary
Lincoln" for "merry Lincoln."</p>

<p>The several versions agree in the outline of the story, and in
many of the details. According to <b>A</b>, boys who are playing
football are joined by Sir Hugh, who kicks the ball through the
Jew's window. Sir Hugh sees the Jew's daughter looking out of the
window, and asks her to throw down the ball. She tells him to
come and get it; this he is afraid to do, for fear she may do to
him "as she did to his father." The Jew's daughter entices him in
with an apple, leads him through nine dark doors, lays him on a
table, and sticks him like a swine; then rolls him in a cake of
lead, and throws him into a draw-well fifty fathoms deep, Our
Lady's draw-well. The boy not returning at eve, his mother sets
forth to seek him; goes to the Jew's castle, the Jew's garden,
and to the draw-well, entreating in each case Sir Hugh to speak.
He answers from the well, bidding his mother go make his
winding-sheet, and he will meet her at the back of merry Lincoln
the next morning. His mother makes his winding-sheet, and the
dead corpse meets her at the back of merry Lincoln: all the bells
of Lincoln are rung without men's hands, and all the books of
Lincoln are read without man's tongue.</p>

<p>The boy's name is Sir Hugh in <b>A</b>-<b>F</b>, etc.; in
<b>K</b> the name is corrupted to Saluter, and in the singular
and interesting copy obtained in New York, <b>N</b>, to Harry
Hughes, the Jew's Daughter in this becoming the Duke's Daughter.

<p>The story of Hugh of Lincoln is told in the Annals of
Waverley, under the year 1255, by a contemporary writer, to this
effect,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A boy in Lincoln, named Hugh, was crucified by the
Jews in contempt of Christ, with various preliminary tortures. To
conceal the act from Christians, the body, when taken from the
cross, was thrown into a running stream; but the water would not
endure the wrong done its maker, and immediately ejected it upon
dry land. The body was then buried in the earth, but was found
above ground the next day. The guilty parties were now very much
frightened and quite at their wit's end; as a last resort they
threw the corpse into a drinking-well. Thereupon the whole place
was filled with so brilliant a light and so sweet an odor that it
was clear to everybody that there must be something holy and
prodigious in the well. The body was seen floating on the water,
and, upon its being drawn up, the hands and feet were found to be
pierced, the head had, as it were, a crown of bloody points, and
there were various other wounds: from all which it was plain that
this was the work of the abominable Jews. A blind woman, touching
the bier on which the blessed martyr's corpse was carrying to the
church, received her sight, and many other miracles followed.
Eighteen Jews, convicted of the crime, and confessing it with
their own mouth, were hanged.</p>

<p>Matthew Paris, also writing contemporaneously, supplies
additional circumstances, one of which, the mother's finding of
the child, is prominent in the ballad.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The Jews of Lincoln
stole the boy Hugh, who was some eight years old, near Peter and
Paul's day, June 29, and fed him properly for ten days, while
they were sending to all parts of England to convoke their
co-believers to a crucifixion of him in contempt of Jesus. When
they were assembled, one of the Lincoln Jews was appointed judge,
a Pilate, as it were, and the boy was sentenced to various
torments; he was scourged till the blood ran, crowned with
thorns, spit upon, pricked with knives, made to drink gall,
mocked and scoffed at, hailed as false prophet; finally he was
crucified, and a lance thrust into his heart. He was then taken
down and disembowelled; for what reason is not known, but, as it
was said, for magical purposes. The mother (whose name, not given
by this chronicler, is known to have been Beatrice) made diligent
search for her lost child for several days, and was told by her
neighbors that they had seen the boy playing with Jewish
children, and going into a Jew's house. This house the mother
entered, and saw the boy's body, which had been thrown into a
well. The town officers were sent for, and drew up the corpse.
The mother's shrieks drew a great concourse to the place, among
whom was Sir John of Lexington, a long-headed and scholarly man
(a priest of the cathedral), who declared that he had heard of
the Jews doing such things before. Laying hands on the Jew into
whose house the boy had been known to go, John of Lexington told
him that all the gold in England would not buy him off;
nevertheless, life and limb should be safe if he would tell
everything. The Jew, Copin by name, encouraged and urged by Sir
John, made a full confession: all that the Christians had said
was true; the Jews crucified a boy every year, if they could get
hold of one, and had crucified this Hugh; they had wished to bury
the body, after they had come to the conclusion that an
innocent's bowels were of no use for divination, but the earth
would not hold it; so they had thrown it into a well, but with no
better success, for the mother had found it, and reported the
fact to the officers. The canons of Lincoln Cathedral begged the
child's body, and buried it in their church with the honors due
to so precious a martyr, The king, who had been absent in the
North, being made acquainted with these circumstances, blamed Sir
John for the promise which he had so improperly made the wretch
Copin. But Copin was still in custody, and, seeing he had no
chance for life, he volunteered to complete his testi- mony!
almost all the Jews in England had been accessory to the child's
death, and almost every city of England where Jews lived had sent
delegates to the ceremony of his immolation, as to a Paschal
sacrifice. Copin was then tied, to a horse, and dragged to the
gallows, and ninety-one other Jews carried to London and
imprisoned. The inquisition made by the king's justices showed
that the crime had been virtually the common act of the Jews of
England, and the mother's appeal to the king, which was pressed
unremittingly, had such effect that on St. Clement's day eighteen
of the richer and more considerable Jews of Lincoln were hanged
on gallows specially constructed for the purpose, more than sixty
being reserved for a like sentence in the tower of
London.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The Annals of Burton give a long report of this case, which is
perhaps contemporary, though the Manuscript is mostly of the next
century. On the last day of July, at a time when all the
principal Jews of England were collected at Lincoln, Hugh, a
school-boy (scholaris) of nine, the only son of a poor woman, was
kidnapped towards sunset, while playing with his comrades, by
Jopin, a Jew of that place. He was concealed in Jopin's house six
and twenty days, getting so little to eat and drink that he had
hardly the strength to speak. Then, at a council of all the Jews,
resident and other, it was determined that he should be put to
death. They stripped him, flogged him, spat in his face, cut off
the cartilage of the nose and the upper lip, and broke the main
upper teeth; then crucified him. The boy, fortified by divine
grace, maintained himself with cheerfulness, and uttered neither
complaint nor groan. They ran sharp points into him from the sole
of his foot to the crown of his head, till the body was covered
with the blood from these wounds, then pierced his side with a
lance, and he gave up the ghost. The boy not coming home as
usual, his mother made search for him. As he was not found, the
information given by his playmates as to when and where they had
last seen him roused a strong suspicion among the Christians that
he had been carried off and killed by the Jews; all the more
because there were so many of them present in the town at that
time, and from all parts of the kingdom, though the Jews
pretended that the occasion for this unusual congregation was a
grand wedding. The truth becoming every day clearer, the mother
set off for Scotland, where the king then chanced to be, and laid
the complaint at his feet. The Jews, meanwhile, knowing that the
business would be looked into, were in great consternation; they
took away the body in the night, and threw it into a well. In the
well it was found in the course of an inquisition ordered by the
king, and, when it was drawn out, a woman, blind for fifteen
years, who had been very fond of the boy, laid her hand on the
body in faith, exclaiming, Alas, sweet little Hugh, that it so
happened! and then rubbed her eyes with the moisture of the body,
and at once recovered her sight. The miracle drew crowds of
people to the spot, and every sick or infirm person that could
get near the body went home well and happy: heaving whereof, the
dean and canons of the cathedral went out in procession to the
body of the holy martyr, and carried it to the minster with all
possible ceremony, where they buried it very honorably
(disregarding the passionate protests of a brother canon, of the
parish to which the boy belonged, who would fain have retained so
precious, and also valuable, an object within his own bounds).
The king stopped at Lincoln, on his way down from Scotland,
looked into the matter, found the charges against the Jews to be
substantiated, and ordered an arrest of the whole pack. They shut
themselves up in their houses, but their houses were stormed. In
the course of the examination which followed, John of Lessington
promised Jopin, the head of the Jews, and their priest (who was
believed to be at the bottom of the whole transaction), that he
would do all he could to save his life, if Jopin would give up
the facts. Jopin, delighted at this assurance, and expecting to
be able to save the other Jews by the use of money, confessed
everything. But considering what a disgrace it would be to the
king's majesty if the deviser and perpetrator of such a felony
escaped scot-free, Jopin was, by sentence of court, tied to the
tail of a horse, dragged a long way through the streets, over
sticks and stones, and hanged. Such other Jews as had been taken
into custody were sent to London, and a good many more, who were
implicated but had escaped, were arrested in the provinces.
Eighteen suffered the same fate as Jopin. The Dominicans exerted
themselves to save the lives of the others, bribed so to do, as
some thought; but they lost favor by it, and their efforts
availed nothing. It was ordered by the government that all the
Jews in the land who had consented to the murder, and especially
those who had been present, namely, seventy-one who were in
prison in London, should die the death of Jopin. But Richard of
Cornwall, the king's brother, to whom the king had pledged all
the Jews in England as security for a loan, stimulated also by a
huge bribe, withstood this violation of vested rights, and
further execution was stayed.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>An Anglo - French ballad of ninety-two stanzas, which also
appears to be contemporary with the event, agrees in many
particulars with the account given in the Annals of Burton,
adding several which are found in none of the foregoing
narratives.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Hugh of Lincoln was kidnapped one evening

mother at once missed him, and searched for him, crying, I have
lost my child! till curfew. She slept little and prayed much, and
immediately after her prayer the suspicion arose in her mind that
her child had been abducted by the Jews. So, with the break of
day, the woman went weeping through the Jewry, calling at the
Jews' doors, Where is my child? Impelled by the suspicion which,
as it pleased God, she had of the Jews, she kept on till she came
to the court. When she came before King Henry (whom God
preserve!), she fell at his feet and begged his grace: 'Sire, my
son was carried off by the Lincoln Jews one evening; see to it,
for charity!" The king swore by God's pity, If it be so as thou
hast told, the Jews shall die; if thou hast lied on the Jews, by
St. Edward, doubt not thou shalt have the same judgment. Soon
after the child was carried off, the Jews of Lincoln made a great
gathering of all the richest of their sect in England. The child
was brought before them, tied with a cord, by the Jew Jopin. They
stripped him, as erst they did Jesus. Then said Jopin, thinking
he spoke to much profit, The child must be sold for thirty pence,
as Jesus was. Agim, the Jew, answered, Give me the child for
thirty pence; but I wish that he should be sentenced to death,
since I have bought him. The Jews said, Let Agim have him, but
let him be put to death forthwith: worse than this, they all
cried with one voice, Let him be put on the cross! The child was
unbound and hanged on the cross, vilely, as Jesus was. His arms
were stretched to the cross, and his feet and hands pierced with
sharp nails, and he was cru- cified alive. Agim took his knife
and pierced the innocent's side, and split his heart in two. As
the ghost left the body, the child called to his mother, Pray
Jesus Christ for me! The Jews buried the body, so that no one
might know of their privity, but some of them, passing the place
the next morning, found it lying above ground. When they heard of
this marvel, they determined in council that the corpse should be
thrown into a jakes; but the morning after it was again above
ground. While they were in agonies of terror, one of their number
came and told them that a woman, who had been his nurse, had
agreed for money to take the body out of the city; but he
recommended that all the wounds should first be filled with
boiling wax. The body was taken off by this nurse and thrown into
a well behind the castle.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A woman coming for water the next
day discovered it lying on the ground, so filthy that she scarce
durst touch it. This woman bethought herself of the child which
had been stolen. She went back to Lincoln, and gave information
to Hugh's stepfather, who found her tale probable by reason of
the suspicion which he already had of the Jews. The woman went
through the city proclaiming that she had found the child, and
everybody flocked to the well. The coroners were sent for, and
came with good will to make their inspection. The body was taken
back to Lincoln. A woman came up, who had long before lost her
sight, and calling out, Alas, pretty Hugh, why are you lying
here! applied her hands to the corpse and then to her eyes, and
regained her sight. All who were present were witnesses of the
miracle, and gave thanks to God. A converted<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Jew presented
himself, and suggested that if they wished to know how the child
came by its death they should wash the body in warm water; and
this being done, the examination which he made enabled him to
show that this treason had been done by the Jews, for the very
wounds of Jesus were found upon the child. They of the cathedral,
hearing of the miracle, came out and carried the body to the
church, and buried it among other saints with great joy: mult ben
firent, cum m'est avis. Soon after, the mother arrived from the
court, very unhappy because she had not been able to find her
child. The Lincoln Jews were apprehended and thrown into prison;
they said, We have been betrayed by Falsim. The next day King
Henry came to Lincoln, and ordered the Jews before him for an
inquest. A wise man who was there took it upon him to say that
the Jew who would tell the truth to the king should fare the
better for it. Jopin, in whose house the treason had been done,
told the whole story as already related. King Henry, when all had
been told, cried, Right ill did he that killed him! The
justices<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> went to council, and condemned Jopin to death: his
body was to be drawn through the city "de chivals forts et ben
ferr&eacute;[s]" till life was extinct, and then to be hanged.
And this was done. I know well where, says the singer: by
Canewic, on the high hill.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Of the other Jews it is only
said that they had much shame.</p>

<p>The English ballads, the oldest of which were recovered about
the middle of the last century, must, in the course of five
hundred years of tradition, have departed considerably from the
early form; in all of them the boy comes to his death for
breaking a Jew's window, and at the hands of the Jew's daughter.
The occurrence of Our Lady's draw-well, in <b>A</b>, is due to a
mixing, to this extent, of the story of Hugh with that of the
young devotee of the Virgin who is celebrated in Chaucer's
Prioresses Tale. In Chaucer's legend, which somewhat strangely
removes the scene to a city in Asia, a little "clergeon" (cf. the
scholaris of the Annals of Burton) excites, not very unnaturally,
the wrath of the Jews by singing the hymn "Alma redemptoris
mater" twice a day, as he passes, schoolward and homeward,
through the Jewry. For this they cut his throat and throw him
into a privy. The Virgin comes to him, and bids him sing the
anthem still, till a grain which she lays upon his tongue shall
be removed. The mother, in the course of her search for her boy,
goes to the pit, under divine direction, and hears him
singing.</p>

<p>Another version of this legend occurs in a collection of the
Miracles of Our Lady in the Vernon Manuscript, c. 1375, leaf
cxxiii, back; printed by Dr. Horstmann in Herrig's Archiv, 1876,
LVI, 224, and again in the Chaucer Society's Originals and
Analogues, p. 281. The boy, in this, contributes to the support
of his family by singing and begging in the streets of Paris. His
song is again Alma redemptoris mater, and he sings it one
Saturday as he goes through the Jewry. He is killed, disposed of,
and discovered as in Chaucer's tale, and the bishop, who "was
come to see that wonder," finds in the child's throat a lily,
inscribed all over with Alma redemptoris mater, which being taken
out the song ceases. But when the child's body is carried to the
minster, and a requiem mass is begun, the corpse rises up, and
sings Salve, sancta parens.</p>

<p>Another variety of the legend is furnished by the Spanish
Franciscan Espina, Fortalicium Fidei, 1459, in the edition of
Lyons, 1500, fol. ccviii, reprinted by the Chaucer Society,
Originals and Analogues, p. 108.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The boy is here called
Alfonsus of Lincoln. The Jews, having got him into their
possession, deliberate what shall be done to him, and decide that
the tongue with which he had sung Alma redemptoris shall be torn
out, likewise the heart in which he had meditated the song, and
the body be thrown into a jakes. The Virgin comes to him, and
puts a precious stone in his mouth, to supply the place of his
tongue, and the boy at once begins to sing the anthem, and keeps
on incessantly for four days; at the end of which time the
discovery is made by the mother, as before. The body is taken to
the cathedral, where the bishop delivers a sermon, concluding
with an injunction upon all present to pour out their
supplications to heaven that this mystery may be cleared up. The
boy rises to his feet, takes the jewel from his mouth, explains
everything that has passed, hands the jewel to the bishop, to be
preserved with other reliques, and expires.</p>

<p>A miracle versified from an earlier source by Gautier de
Coincy, some thirty or forty years before the affair of Hugh of
Lincoln, is obviously of the same ultimate origin as the
Prioresses Tale. A poor woman in England had an only son with a
beautiful voice, who did a good deal for the support of his
mother by his singing. The Virgin took a particular interest in
this clerconcel, among whose songs was Gaude Maria, which he used
to give in a style that moved many to tears. One day, when he was
playing in the streets with his comrades, they came to the Jews'
street, where some entertainment was going on which had collected
a great many people, who recognized the boy, and asked him to
give them a song about Our Lady. He sang with his usual pathos
and applause. Jews were listening with the rest, and one of them
was so exasperated by a passage in the hymn that he would have
knocked the singer on the head then and there, had he dared. When
the crowd was dispersed, this Jew enticed the child into his
house by flattery and promises, struck him dead with an axe, and
buried him. His mother went in search of him, and learned the
second day that the boy had been singing in the Jewry the day
before, and it was intimated that the Jews might have laid hands
on him and killed him. The woman gave the Virgin to understand
that if she lost her child she should never more have confidence
in her power; nevertheless, more than twenty days passed before
any light was thrown on his disappearance. At the end of that
time, being one day in the Jews' street, and her wild
exclamations having collected a couple of thousand people, she
gave vent to her conviction that the Jews had killed her son.
Then the Virgin made the child, dead and buried as he was, sing
out Gaude Maria in a loud and clear voice. An assault was made on
the Jews and the Jews' houses, including that of the murderer;
and here, after much searching, guided by the singing, they found
the boy buried under the door, perfectly well, and his face as
red as a fresh cherry. The boy related how he had been decoyed
into the house and struck with an axe; the Virgin had come to him
in what seemed a sleep, and told him that he was remiss in not
singing her response as he had been wont, upon which he began to
sing. Bells were rung, the Virgin was glorified, some Jews were
converted, the rest massacred. (G. de Coincy, ed. Poquet, col.
557 ff; Chaucer Society, Originals and Analogues, p. 253 ff.) The
same miracle, with considerable variations, occurs in Mariu Saga,
ed. Unger, p. 203, No 62, 'Af klerk ok gy&eth;ingum;' also in
Collin de Plancy, L&eacute;gendes des Saintes Images, p. 218,
'L'Enfant de Choeur de Notre-Dame du Puy,' under the date
1325.</p>

<p>Murders like that of Hugh of Lincoln have been imputed to the
Jews for at least seven hundred and fifty years,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and the
charge, which there is reason to suppose may still from time to
time be renewed, has brought upon the accused every calamity that
the hand of man can inflict, pillage, confiscation, banishment,
torture, and death, and this in huge proportions. The process of
these murders has often been described as a parody of the
crucifixion of Jesus. The motive most commonly alleged, in
addition to the expression of contempt for Christianity, has been
the obtaining of blood for use in the Paschal rites, a most
unhappily devised slander, in stark contradiction with Jewish
precept and practice. That no Christian child was ever killed by
a Jew, that there never even was so much truth as that (setting
aside the object) in a single case of these particular
criminations, is what no Christian or Jew would undertake to
assert; but of these charges in the mass it may safely be said,
as it has been said, that they are as credible as the miracles
which, in a great number of cases, are asserted to have been
worked by the reliques of the young saints, and as well
substantiated as the absurd sacrilege of stabbing, baking, or
boiling the Host,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_016','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> or the enormity of poisoning springs,

pretended child-murders, with their horrible consequences, are

human race.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_018','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Cases in England, besides that of Hugh of Lincoln, are William
of Norwich, 1137, the Saxon Chronicle, Earle, p. 263, Acta
Sanctorum, March (25), III, 588; a boy at Gloucester, 1160,
Brompton, in Twysden, col. 1050, Knyghton, col. 2394; Robert of
St. Edmondsbury, 1181, Gervasius Dorobornensis, Twysden, col.
1458; a boy at Norwich, stolen, circumcised, and kept for
crucifixion, 1235, Matthew Paris, Chronica Majora, Luard, III,
305 (see also III, 543, 1239, IV, 30, 1240); a boy at London,
1244, Matthew Paris, IV, 377 (doubtful, but solemnly buried in
St. Paul's); a boy at Northampton, 1279, crucified, but not quite
killed, the continuator of Florence of Worcester, Thorpe, II,
222.</p>

<p>It would be tedious and useless to attempt to make a
collection of the great number of similar instances which have
been mentioned by chroniclers and ecclesiastical writers; enough
come readily to hand without much research.</p>

<p>A boy was crucified and thrown into the Loire by the Jews of
Blois in 1171: Sigiberti Gemblacensis Chronica, auctarium Roberti
de Monte, in Pertz, Mon. Germ. Hist. Script., VI, 520, Gratz,
Geschichte der Juden, VI, 217-19. Philip Augustus had heard in
his early years from playmates that the Jews sacrificed a
Christian annually (and, according to some, partook of his
heart), and this is represented as having been his reason for
expelling the Jews from France. Richard of Pontoise was one of
these victims, in 1179: Rigordus, Gesta Philippi Augusti, p. 14
f., 6, and Guillelmus Armoricus, p. 179, &#167; 17, in the
edition of 1882; Acta Sanctorum, March (25), III, 591. France had
such a martyr as late as 1670: see the case of Raphael
L&eacute;vy in Eisenmenger, Entdecktes Judenthum, 2<sup>r</sup>
Theil, 224; Drumont, La France Juive, II, 402-09.</p>

<p>Alfonso the Wise has recorded in the Siete Partidas, 1255,
that he had heard that the Jews were wont to crucify on Good
Friday children that they had stolen (or waxen images, when
children were not to be had), Partida VII, Tit. XXIV, Ley
ii<sup>a</sup>, III, 670, ed. 1807, and this was one of the most
effective grounds offered in justification of the expulsion of
the Jews under Ferdinand and Isabella: Amador de los Rios,
Historia de los Judios de Espa&ntilde;a, I, 483 f. San Dominguito
de Val, a choir-boy of seven, Chaucer's clergeon over again, was
said to have been stolen and crucified at Saragossa in 1250:
Basnage, Histoire des Juifs, 1726, vol. ix, 2d part, pp. 484-86;
Acta SS., Aug. (31), VI, 777. Several children were crucified at
Valladolid in 1452, and like outrages occurred near Zamora in
1454, and at Sepulveda in 1468: Gr&auml;tz, VIII, 238. Juan
Passamonte, "el ni&ntilde;o de Guardia," was kidnapped in 1489,
and crucified in 1490: Llorente (Pellier), Histoire de
l'Inquisition, ed. 1818, I, 258 f.</p>

<p>Switzerland affords several stories of the sort: a boy at
Frisingen in 1287, Ulrich, Sammlung j&uuml;discher Geschichten,
p. 149; Rudolf of Bern, 1288 or 1294, Ulrich, pp. 143-49, Acta

<p>The charge against the Jews of murdering children for their
blood is by no means as yet a thing of the past. The accusation
has been not infrequently made in Russia during the present
century. Although the entertaining of such an inculpation was
forbidden by an imperial ukase in 1817, a criminal process on
this ground, involving forty-three persons, was instituted in
1823, and was brought to a close only in 1835, when the
defendants were acquitted on account of the entire failure of
proof: Stobbe, p. 186. The murder of a child of six in Neuhoven,
in the district of D&uuml;sseldorf, in 1834, occasioned the
demolition of two Jewish houses and a synagogue: Illgen, in
Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die historische Theologie, 1837, Heft 3, 40,
note. In February, 1840, a Greek boy of ten disappeared in
Rhodes. The Jews were believed to have killed him for his blood.
Torture was freely used to extort confessions. The case was
removed to Constantinople, and in July, upon the report of the
supreme court, the Divan pronounced the innocence of the
defendants: Illgen, Z. f. d. Hist. Theol., 1841, Heft 4, p. 172,
note, Hume, Sir Hugh of Lincoln, p. 30.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d155_021','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In 1881, the Jews
were in suspicion on account of a boy at Alexandria, and of a
girl at Calarasi, Wallachia: Civilt&auml; Cattolica, VIII, 225,
737. The Moniteur de Rome, June 15, 1883, affords several more of
these too familiar tales. A Greek child was stolen at Smyrna, a
few years before the date last mentioned, towards the time of the
Passover, and its body found four days after, punctured with pins
in a thousand places. The mother, like Beatrice in 1255,
denounced the Jews as the culprits; the Christian population rose
in a mass, rushed to the Jews' quarter, and massacred more than
six hundred. An affair of the same nature took place at Balata,
the Ghetto of Constantinople, in 1842, of which the consequences
to the Jews are not mentioned; and again at Galata, "where the
Jews escaped by bribing the Turkish police to suppress testimony"
(Dru- mont, II, 412). A young girl disappeared at
Tisza-Eszl&aacute;r, in Hungary, in April, 1882, and the Jews
were suspected of having made away with her. The prelim inary
judicial inquiry was marked by the intimidation and torture of
several persons examined for evidence. Fifteen who were held for
trial were absolutely acquitted in August, 1883, after more than
a year of imprisonment. The shops of Jews in Budapest were
plundered by Christians disappointed in the verdict! (Der
Blut-Prozess von Tisza-Eszl&aacute;r, New York, 1883.)</p>
