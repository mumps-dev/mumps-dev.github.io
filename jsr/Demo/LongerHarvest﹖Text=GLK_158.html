<h3>158. Hugh Spencer's Feats in France</h3>

<p>Of the many Hugh Spensers if we select the younger of the
favorites of Edward II, his exploits, had they any foundation in
reality, would necessarily fall between 1322, when Charles IV
came to the French throne, and 1326, when the Spensers, father
and son, ended their career. The French king says in B 8 that
Spenser had sunk his ships and slain his men. Hugh Spenser the
younger was engaged in piracy in 1321. The quarrel between Edward
II and Charles IV, touching the English possessions in France,
was temporarily arranged in 1325, hut not through the mediation
of the younger Spenser, who never was sent on an emhassy to
France. Another Sir Hugh Spenser was a commander in the Earl of
Arundel's fleet in the operations against the French in Charles
VI's time, 1387, and was taken prisoner in consequence of his
ship grounding.</p>

<p>This ballad is after the fashion of Russian bylinas, and
especially the bylina of Dobrynja and Vasilij Kaziruirovic. In
this very fine ballad, Vladimir is in arrears with his tribute to
a Saracen king, and appoints Vasilij his envoy, to make payment.
Vasilij asks that he may have Dobrynja go with him, and Dobrynja
asks for Ivanuska's company. Dobrynja beats the king at chess and
at the bow (which corresponds to the justing in the English
ballad); then follows a great fight, the result of which is that
the Saracen king is fain to pay tribute himself. See Wollner,
Volksepik der Grossrussen, pp. 123-5.</p>
