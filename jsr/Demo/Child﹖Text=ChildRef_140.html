<p><b>B</b> is given by Ritson, Robin Hood, 1795, II, 151, "from
the York edition of Robin Hood's garland;" <b>C</b>, the same,
II, 216, from an Aldermary Churchyard garland, and by Evans, Old
Ballads, 1777, 1784, I, 215.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. Robin Hood, while on his way to Nottingham, meets an
old woman who is weeping for three squires condemned to die that
day, not for recognized crimes, but for killing the king's deer.
These seem to be his own men: st. 6. Pursuing his way, he meets
an old "palmer," really a beggar, who confirms the bad news. He
changes clothes with the palmer (who at first thinks the proposal
a mock), and at Nottingham comes upon the sheriff, and asks what
he will give an old fellow to be his hangman. The sheriff offers
suits and pence; Robin says, hangmen be cursed, he will never
take to that business. He has a horn in his pocket which would
blow the sheriff little good; the sheriff bids him blow his fill.
The first blast brings a hundred and fifty of Robin's men; the
second brings three score more. They free their own men and hang
the sheriff.</p>

<p>In <b>C</b> the three squires are expressly said to be the
woman's sons;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d140_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> for the palmer we have a beggar; Robin asks it
as a boon that he may be hangman, and will have nothing for his
service but three blasts on his horn, 'that their souls to heaven
may flee.' The horn brings a hundred and ten men, and the sheriff
surrenders the three squires.</p>

<p>In the fragment <b>A</b>, Robin changes clothes with an old
man, who appears by stanza 11 to be a beggar. His men are with
him meanwhile, and he orders them to conceal themselves in a wood
until they hear his horn. A blast brings three hundred of them;
Robin casts off his beggar's gear and stands in his red velvet
doublet;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d140_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> his men bend their bows and beset the gallows. The
sheriff throws up his hands and begs for terms; Robin demands the
three squires. The sheriff objects, for they are the king's
felons; Robin will have them, or the sheriff shall be the first
man to flower the tree.</p>

<p>'Robin Hood and the Beggar,' No 133. from stanza 16, is
another version of this ballad. Robin changes clothes with a
beggar, after a hard fight in which he has had the worse, goes to
Nottingham, and hears that three brothers are condemned to die.
He hies to the sheriff to plead for them; a gentleman at the door
tells him they must be hanged for deer-stealing clearly proved.
At the gallows Robin blows his horn; a hundred archers present
themselves, and ask his will. He commands them to shoot east and
west and spare no man. The sheriff and his men, all that are not
laid low, fly, and the three brothers, who have already shown
their quality, are added to Robin's company.</p>

<p>A Scottish version of <b>B</b>, derived from the English, is
given in an appendix. It occurs in Kinloch Manuscripts, V, 288,
and may be as old as the York garland used by Ritson, or
older.</p>

<p>Ritson was informed by his friend Edward Williams, the Welsh
bard, that <b>C</b> and its tune were well known in South Wales
by the name of Marchog Glas, or Green Knight. As to the tune,
says Dr. Riinbault, it is not to be found in the collections of
Welsh airs, nor was his friend John Parry, then representing the
Welsh bards, able to give any account of it. Nothing further is
said by Rimbault, either way, of the ballad.</p>

<p><b>B</b> 6, in which Robin reminds the old woman that she had
once given him to sup and dine, implicitly as a reason for his
exerting himself in behalf of the three squires (who, according
to the title of the ballad, but not the text, are her three
sons), looks like a reminiscence of st. 9 of R.H. and the Bishop,
No 143, where an old woman shows her gratitude to Robin Hood for
having given her shoes and hose, and may not originally have
belonged here.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d140_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>B</b> 1, <b>A</b> 9<sup>1,2</sup>, 11<sup>3,4</sup>,
<b>B</b> 25, 28<sup>1,2</sup> are almost repetitions of Robin
Hood and the Curtal Friar, <b>A</b> 1, <b>A</b> 4<sup>3,4</sup>,
12<sup>3,4</sup>, <b>B</b> 26, 28 1,2 .<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d140_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The rescue in the ballad is introduced into Anthony Munday's
play of The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntington, Act II, Scene
2. Scarlet and Scathlock, sons of Widow Scarlet, are to be
hanged. Friar Tuck attends them as confessor. Robin Hood,
disguised as an old man, pretends that they have killed his son,
and asks the sheriff that they may be delivered to him for
revenge. The sheriff allows them to be unbound. Robin, for a
feigned reason, blows his horn; Little John and Much come in and
begin a fight; Friar Tuck, pretending to help the sheriff, knocks
down his men; the sheriff and his men run away. (Dodsley's Old
Plays, ed. Hazlitt, VIII, 134-41.)</p>

<p>Ritson, Robin Hood, 1832, II, 155, suggests that the
circumstance of Robin's changing clothes with the palmer may
possibly be taken from "the noble history of Ponthus of Galyce,"
printed by Wynkyn de Worde, 1511, and cites this passage, which
resembles the narrative in <b>B</b> 8, 10, 11: "And as he
[Ponthus] rode, he met with a poore palmer, beggynge his brede,
the whiche had his gowne all to-clouted and an olde pylled hatte:
so he alyght, and sayd to the palmer, frende, we shall make a
chaunge of all our garmentes, for ye shall have my gowne and I
shall have yours and your hatte. A, syr, sayd the palmer, ye
bourde you with me. In good fayth, sayd Ponthus, I do not; so he
dyspoyled hym and cladde hym with all his rayment, and he put
vpon hym the poore mannes gowne, his gyrdell, his hosyn, his
shone, his hatte and his bourden."</p>

<p>This noble history is taken from one in French which is merely
the romance of Horn turned into prose, and it is also possible
that the passage in the English ballad may be derived from some
version of Hind Horn: see No 17.</p>

<p>Wallace changes clothes with a beggar in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_157.html">Gude Wallace</a>,' No
157, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, where there is a general likeness to
this ballad of Robin Hood. It may be noted that Wulric the Heron,
one of the comrades of Hereward, rescues four brothers who were
about to be hanged, killing some of their common enemies: Michel,
Chroniques Anglo-Normandes, II, 51.</p>

<p><b>B</b> is translated by Anastasius Gr&uuml;n, p. 135,
Doenniges, p. 135, Knortz L. u. R. Altenglands, No 19; combined
with <b>C</b>, by Talvj, Charakteristik, p. 489.</p>
