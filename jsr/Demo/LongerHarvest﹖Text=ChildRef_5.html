<p>Eight copies of this ballad are extant, four of them hitherto
unpublished. <b>A a</b>, No 16 in the Jaraieson-Brown Manuscript, is one
of twenty ballads written down from 'the recitation of Mrs. Brown
of Falkland, by her nephew, Robert Scott, in 1783, or shortly
before. From these twenty thirteen were selected, and, having
first been revised by Mrs. Brown, were sent, with two others, to
William Tytler in the year just mentioned. William Tytler's manuscript
has disappeared, but a list of the ballads which it contained,
with the first stanza of each, is given by Dr. Anderson, in
Nichols's Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth
Century, vii, 176. <b>B</b> is the 'Cospatrick' of the Border
Minstrelsy, described by Scott as taken down from the recitation
of a lady (known to be Miss Christian Rutherford, his mother's
sister) "with some stanzas transferred from Herd's copy, and some
readings adopted from a copy in Mrs. Brown's manuscript under the
title of Child Brenton," that is, from <b>A b</b>. <b>C</b>
purports to be one of a considerable number of pieces, "copied
from the recital of a peasant-woman of Galloway, upwards of
ninety years of age." Though overlaid with verses of Cunningham's
making (of which forty or fifty may be excided in one mass) and
though retouched almost everywhere, both the ground work of the
story and some genuine lines remain unimpaired. The omission of
most of the passage referred to, and the restoration of the
stanza form, will give us, perhaps, a thing of shreds and
patches, but still a ballad as near to genuine as some in Percy's
Reliques or even Scott's Minstrelsy. <b>D</b> and <b>F</b> are
(the former presumably, the second certainly) from recitation of
the first quarter of this
<a name="Page_I_63"/>
century. <b>E</b> is one of the few
ballads in Elizabeth Cochrane's song-book, and probably of the
first half of the last century. <b>G</b>, the earliest printed
form of the ballad, appeared in Herd's first collection, in the
year 1769. <b>H</b> was taken down from recitation by the late 
Dr. Hill Burton in his youth.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and C agree in these points: A bride, not
being a maid, looks forward with alarm to her wedding night, and
induces her bower-woman to take her place for the nonce. The
imposture is detected by the bridegroom, through the agency of
magical blankets, sheets, and pillows, <b>A</b>; or of blankets,
bed, sheet, and sword, <b>B</b>; or simply of the Billie Blin,
<b>C</b>. (The sword is probably an editorial insertion; and
Jamieson, Illustrations of Northern Antiquities, p. 343, doubts,
but without sufficient reason, the Billie Blin.) The bridegroom
has recourse to his mother, who demands an explanation of the
bride, and elicits a confession that she had once upon a time
encountered a young man in a wood, who subjected her to violence.
Before they parted, he gave her certain tokens, which he enjoined
her to be very careful of, a lock of his hair, a string of beads,
a gold ring, and a knife. <b>B</b> omits the knife, and <b>C</b>
the beads. The mother goes back to her son, and asks what he had
done with the tokens she had charged him never to part with. He
owns that he had presented them to a lady, one whom he would now
give all his possessions to have for his wife. The lady of the
greenwood is identified by the tokens.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, and <b>D</b> make the mother set a golden
chair for the bride, in which none but a maid can sit, <b>D</b>
[no leal maid will sit till bidden, <b>C</b>]. In <b>D</b> the
chair is declined; in <b>C</b>, taken without bidding; in
<b>A</b> the significance of the chair has been lost. <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>, <b>G</b> employ no kind of test of maidenhood, the
bride frankly avows that she is with child to another man; and
<b>D</b>, as well as <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, omits the
substitution of the chambermaid. The tokens in <b>D</b> are a
chain, a ring, and three locks of hair; in <b>E</b>, gloves and a
ring; in <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, green gloves, a ring, and three
locks [plaits] of hair. Only the ring reinains in <b>H</b>.</p>

<p>"This "ballad," says Motherwell (1827), "is very popular, and
is known to reciters under a variety of names. I have heard it
called Lord Bangwell, Bengwill, Dingwall, Brengwill, etc., and
The Seven Sisters, or the Leaves of Lind." He adds: "There is an
unedited ballad in Scotland, which is a nearer approximation to
the Danish song, inasmuch as the substitution of the maiden
sister for the real bride constitutes a prominent feature of the
tale." <a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d005_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> (Minstrelsy, Introduction, lxix 21 and xc.)</p>

Earl of Dunbar, in the days of Wallace and Bruce." Mr. Macmath
informs me that it 'is in use at the present day in the families

others, claim descent from the ancient earls of Dunbar and March.

<p><b>Swedish</b>. Three Swedish versions of this ballad were
given by Afzelius: <b>A</b>, 'Riddar Olle' in 50 two-line
stanzas, II, 217; <b>B</b>, 19 two-line stanzas, II, 59; <b>C</b>,
19 two-line stanzas, II, 56: No 33, I, 175-182 of Bergstr&ouml;m's
edition. Besides these, there are two fragments in Cavallius and
Stephens's unprinted collection: <b>D</b>, 6 stanzas; <b>E</b>, 7
stanzas, the latter printed in Grundtvig, V, 307.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d005_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> All
<a name="Page_I_64"/>
these
were obtained from recitation in the present century. <b>A</b>
comes nearest to our <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. Like Scottish <b>B</b>,
it seems to have been compounded from several copies. Sir Olof
betrothed Ingalilla, and carried her home for the spousal,
wearing a red gold crown and a wan cheek. Ingalilla gave birth to
twin-boys. Olof had a maid who resembled Ingalilla completely,
and who, upon Ingalilla's entreaty, consented to play the part of
bride on the morrow. Dressed in Ingalilla's clothes, blue kirtle,
green jacket, etc., and wearing five gold rings and a gold crown,
the maid rode to church, with Ingalilla at her back, and her
beauty was admired by all as she came and went. But outside of
the church were a good many musicians; and one of these piped
out, "God-a-mercy, Ingalilla, no maid art thou!" Ingalilla threw
into the piper's hand some thing which made him change his tune.
He was an old drunken fellow, and no one need mind what he sang.
After five days of drinking, they took the bride to her chamber,
not without force. Ingalilla 1aore the light before her, and
helped put her to bed; then lay down herself. Olof had over him a
fur rug, which could talk as well as he, and it called out,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Hear me, Sir Olof, hear what I say;<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou hast taken a strumpet, and missed a may.'<br/>
And Olof, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Hear, little Inga, sweetheart,' he said;<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'What didst thou get for thy maidenhead?'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d005_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a><br/>
Inga explained. Her father was a strange sort of man, and built
her bower by the sea-strand, where all the king's courtiers took
ship. Nine had broken in, and one had robbed her of her honor. He
had given her an embroidered sark, a blue kirtle, green jacket,
black mantle, gloves, five gold rings, a red gold crown, a golden
harp, and a silver-mounted knife, which she now wishes in the
youngster's body. The conclusion is abruptly told in two stanzas.
Olof bids Inga not to talk so, for he is father of her children.
He embraces her and gives her a queen's crown and name. <b>B</b>
has the same story, omitting the incident of the musician.
<b>C</b> has preserved this circumstance, but has lost both the
substitution of the waiting-woman for the bride and the magical
coverlet. <b>D</b> has also lost these important features of the
original story; <b>B</b> has retained them.</p>

<p><b>Danish</b>. 'Brud ikke M&oslash;,' Grundtvig, No 274, v, 304.
There are two old versions (more properly only one, so close is
the agreement), and a third from recent tradition. This last,
Grundtvig's <b>C</b>, from Jutland, 1856, seems to be of Swedish
origin, and, like Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, wants the talking
coverlet, though it has kept the other material feature, that of
the substitution. <b>A</b> is found in two manuscripts, one of
the sixteenth and the other of the seventeenth century. <b>B</b>
is the well-known 'Ingefred og Gudrune,' or 'Herr Samsings
Nattergale,' Syv, iv, No 62, Danske Viser, No 194, translated in
Jamieson's Illustrations, p. 340, and by Prior, in, 347. A later
form of B, from recent recitation, 1868, is given in Kristensen's
Jydske Folkeviser, I, No 53.</p>

<p>The story in <b>A</b> runs thus: S&oslash;lverlad and
Vendelrod [Ingefred and Gudrune] were sitting together, and
Vendelrod wept sorely. S&oslash;lverlad asked her sister the
reason, and was told there was cause. Would she be bride one
night? Vendelrod would give her wedding clothes and all her
outfit. But S&oslash;lverlad asked for bridegroom too, and
Vendelrod would not give up her bridegroom, happen what might.
She went to church and was married to Samsing. On the way from
church they met a spaeman [<b>B</b>, shepherd], who warned
Vendelrod that Samsing had some nightin gales that could tell
him. whether he had married a maid or no. The sisters turned
aside
<a name="Page_I_65"/>
and changed clothes, but could not change cheeks!
S&oslash;lverlad was conducted to Samsing's house and placed on
the bride bench. An unlucky jester called out, "Methinks this is
not Vendelrod!" but a gold ring adroitly thrown into his bosom
opened his eyes still wider, and made him pretend he had meant
nothing. The supposed bride is put to bed. Samsing invokes his
nightingales: "Have I a maid or no?" They reply, it is a maid
that lies in the bed, but Vendelrod stands on the floor. Samsing
asks Vendelrod why she avoided her bed, and she answers: her
father lived on the strand; her bower was broken into by a large
company of men, and one of them robbed her of her honor. In this
case there are no tokens for evidence. Samsing owns immediately
that he and his men had broken into the bower, and Vendelrod's
agony is over.</p>

<p>Some of the usual tokens, gold harp, sark, shoes, and
silver-mounted knife, are found in the later <b>C</b>. Danish
<b>D</b> is but a single initial stanza.</p>

<p>Besides S&oslash;lverlad and Vendelrod, there is a
considerable number of Danish ballads characterized by the
feature that a bride is not a maid, and most or all of these have
similarities to 'Gil Brenton.' 'Hr. Find og Vendelrod,'
Grundtvig, No 275, has even the talking blanket (sometimes
misunderstood to be a bed-<i>board</i>). In this piece there is no
substitution. Vendelrod gives birth to children, and the news
makes Find jump over the table. Still he puts the question
mildly, who is the father, and recognizes that he is the man,
upon hearing the story of the bower on the strand, and seeing
half a gold ring which Vendelrod had received "for her
honor."</p>

<p>In 'Ingelilles Bryllup,' Grundtvig, No 276, Blidelild is
induced to take Ingelild's place by the promise that she shall
marry Ingelild's brother. Hr. Magnus asks her why she is so sad,
and says he knows she is not a maid. Blidelild says, "Since you
know so much, I will tell you more," and relates Ingelild's
adventure, how she had gone out to the river, and nine knights
came riding by, etc. [so <b>A</b>; in <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> we
have the bower on the strand, as before]. Hr. Magnus avows that
he was the ninth, who stayed when eight rode away. Blidelild begs
that he will allow her to go and look for some lost rings, and
uses the opportunity to send back Ingelild in her stead.</p>

<p>Various other Scandinavian ballads have more or less of the
story of those which have been mentioned. In the Danish 'Brud i
Vaande,' Grundtvig, No 277, a bride is taken with untimely pains
while being "brought home." The question asked in several of the
Scottish ballads, whether the saddle is uncomfortable, occurs in
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>; the bower that was forced by eight swains and
a knight in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>; the gifts in
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>; and an express acknowledgment of
the act of violence by the bridegroom in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>D</b>. We find all of these traits except the first in the
corresponding Swedish ballad 'Herr &Auml;ster och Fr&ouml;ken
Sissa,' Afzelius, No 38, new ed., No 32, 1; the saddle and broken
bower in Swedish <b>D</b>, Grundtvig, No 277, Bilag 1; only the
saddle in Swedish <b>F</b>, Grundtvig, No. 277, Bilag 3, and
<b>C</b>, Arwidsson, No 132; the saddle and gifts in Ice landic
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, Grundtvig, No
277, Bilag 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>

<p>'Peder og Malfred,' Grundtvig, No 278, in four versions, the
oldest from a manuscript of 1630, represents Sir Peter as riding
away from home about a month after his marriage, and meeting a
woman who informs him that there is a birth in his house. He
returns, and asks who is the father. Sir Peter satisfies himself
that he is the man by identifying the gifts, in <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>; and in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> we have
also the bower by the strand.</p>

<p>In 'Oluf og Ellinsborg,' Grundtvig, No 279, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, one of the queen's ladies is habitually sad,
and is pressed by her lover to account for this. She endeavors to
put him off with fictitious reasons, but finally nerves her self
to tell the truth: she was walking by her self in her orchard,
when five knights came riding by, and one was the cause of her
grief. Oluf owns it was all his doing. A Swedish ballad,
remarkably close to the Danish, from a manuscript of the date
1572 (the oldest Danish version is also from a manuscript of
<a name="Page_I_66"/>
the
16th century), is 'Riddar Lage och Stolts Elensborg,' Arwidsson,
No 56.</p>

<p>'Iver Hr. Jons&oslash;n,' Grundtvig, No 280, in five versions,
the oldest of the 16th century, exhibits a lady as fearing the
arrival of her lover's ship, and sending her mother to meet him,
while she takes to her bed. Immediately upon her betrothed's
entering her chamber, she abruptly discloses the cause of her
trouble. Eight men had broken into her bower on the strand, and
the ninth deprived her of her honor. Iver Hr. Jons0n, with as
little delay, confesses that he was the culprit, and makes prompt
arrangements for the wedding.</p>

<p>There is another series of ballads, represented by 'Leesome
Brand' in English, and by 'Redselille og Medelvold' in Danish,
which describe a young woman, who is on the point of becoming a
mother, as compelled to go off on horseback with her lover, and
suffering from the ride. We find the question, whether the saddle
is too narrow or the way too long, in the Danish 'Bolde Hr.
Nilaus' L&oslash;n,' Grundtvig, 270, Redselille og Medelvold,'
Grundt vig, 271 <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>,
<b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>Y</b>, and
the Norwegian versions, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>,
of 'S&oslash;nnens Sorg,' Grundtvig, 272, Bilag 1, 4, 5, 6.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d005_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
The gifts also occur in Grundtvig's 271 <b>A</b>, <b>Z</b>, and
Norwegian <b>D</b>, Bilag 9.</p>

<p>Perhaps no set of incidents is repeated so often in northern
ballads as the forcing of the bower on the strand, the giving of
keepsakes, the self-identification of the ravisher through these,
and his full and hearty reparation. All or some of these traits
are found in many ballads besides those belonging to the groups
here spoken of: as 'Hildebrand og Hilde,' <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>,
Grundtvig, No 83, and Norwegian <b>A</b>, III, 857; 4 Guldsmedens
Datter,' Grundtvig, 245, and its Swedish counterpart at p. 481 of
the preface to the same, and in Eva Wigstr&ouml;m's Folkdiktning,
p. 37, No 18; 'Liden Kirstins Dans,' Grundtvig, 263 (translated
by Prior, 112), and Norwegian <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, Bilag 2, 3;
'Jomfruens Harpeslaet,' Grundtvig, 265 (translated by Jamieson, '
Illustrations,' p. 382, Prior, 123, Buchanan, p. 6), and Swedish
D, Bilag 2, Swedish <b>A</b>, Afzelius, 81. So Landstad, 42, 45;

<p>A very pretty Norwegian tale has for the talisman a
stepping-stone at the side of the bed: Asbj&oslash;rnsen og Moe,
No 29, 'Vesle Aase Gaasepige,' Dasent, 2d ed., p. 478. An English
prince had pictures taken of all the handsomest princesses, to
pick his bride by. When the chosen one arrived, Aase the
goose-girl informed her that the stone at the bedside knew
everything and told the prince; so if she felt uneasy on any
account, she must not step on it. The princess begged Aase to
take her place till the prince was fast asleep, and then they
would change. When Aase came and put her foot on the stone, the
prince asked, "Who is it that is stepping into my bed?" "A maid
clean and pure," answered the stone. By and by the princess came
and took Aase's place. When they were getting up in the morning,
the prince asked again, "Who is it stepping out of my bed?"
"One that has had three children," said the stone. The prince sent
his first choice away, and tried a second. Aase faithfully warned
her, and she had cause for heeding the advice. When Aase stepped
in, the stone said it was a maid clean and pure; when the
princess stepped out, the stone said it was one that had had six
children. The prince was longer in hitting on a third choice.
Aase took the bride's place once more, but this time the prince
put a ring on her finger, which was so tight that she could not
get it off, for he saw that all was not right. In the morning,
when he asked, "Who is stepping out of my bed?" the stone
answered, "One that has had nine children." Then the prince
asked the stone to clear up the mystery, and it revealed how the
princesses had put little Aase in their place. The prince went
straight to Aase to see if she had the ring. She had tied a rag
over her finger, pretending she had cut it; but the prince soon
had the rag off, recognized his ring, and Aase got the prince,
for the good reason that so it was to be.</p>

<p>The artifice of substituting waiting-woman
<a name="Page_I_67"/>
for bride has been
thought to be derived from the romance of Tristan, in which
Brangwain [Brengain, Brangaene] sacrifices herself for Isold:
Scott's 'Sir Tristrem,' ii, 54; Gottfried v. Strassburg, xviii,
ed. Bechstein. Grundtvig truly remarks that a borrowing by the
romance from the popular ballad is as probable a supposition as
the converse; and that, even should we grant the name of the hero
of the ballad to be a reminiscence of that of Isold's attendant
(e. g. Brangwill of Brangwain), nothing follows as to the
priority of the romance in respect to this passage. A similar
artifice is employed in the ballad of 'Torkild Trundeson,'
Danske Viser, 200 (translated by Prior, 100); Afzelius, II, 86,
from the Danish; Arwidsson, 36. The resemblance is close to
'Ingelilles Bryllup,' C, Grundtvig, 276. See also, further on,

<p>The Billie Blin presents himself in at least four Scottish
ballads: 'Gil Brenton,' <b>C</b>; '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_6.html">Willie's Lady</a>;' one version of
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_53.html">Young Beichan</a>;' two of 'The Knight and Shepherd's Daughter;' and
also in the English ballad of 'King Arthur and the King of
Cornwall,' here under the slightly disfigured name of Burlow
Beanie.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d005_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In all he is a serviceable household demon; of a
decidedly benignant disposition in the first four, and, though a
loathly fiend with seven heads in the last, very obedient and
useful when once thoroughly subdued. He is clearly of the same
nature as the Dutch <i>belewitte</i> and German bilwiz,
characterized by Grimm as a friendly domestic genius, <i>penas,
guote holde</i>; and the names are actually associated in a
passage cited by Grimm from Voet: "De illis quos nostrates
appellant <i>beeldwit et blinde belien</i>, a quibus nocturna
visa videri atque ex iis arcana revelari putant."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d005_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Though the
etymology of these words is not unencumbered with difficulty, bit
seems to point to a just and kindly-tempered being. Bilvis, in
the seventh book of Saxo Grammaticus, is an aged counsellor whose
bent is to make peace, while his brother B&ouml;lv&iacute;s, a
blind man, is a strife-breeder and mischief-maker.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d005_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The same
opposition of Bil and B&ouml;l apparently occurs in the Edda,
Gr&iacute;mnism&aacute;l, 47<sup>4</sup>, where Bil-eygr and
B&ouml;l-eygr (Bal-eygr) are appellatives of Odin, which may
signify mild-eyed and evil-eyed. B&ouml;lv&iacute;s is found
again in the Hr&ocirc;mund's saga, under the description of
'Blind the Bad,' and 'the Carl Blind whose name was
Bav&iacute;s.' But much of this saga is taken from the story of
Helgi Hundingslayer; and Blind the Bad in the saga is only
S&aelig;mund's Blindr inn b&ouml;lv&iacute;si, the blind man
whose baleful wit sees through the disguise of Helgi, and all but
betrays the rash hero to his enemies; that is, Odin in his
malicious mood (B&ouml;lverkr), who will presently be seen in the
ballad of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_7.html">Earl Brand</a>' masking as Old Carl Hood, "aye for ill
and never for good." Originally and properly, perhaps, only tne
bad member of this" mythical pair is blind; but it would not be
at all strange that later tradition, which confuses and degrades
so much in the old mythology, should transfer blindness to the
good-natured one, and give rise to the anomalous Billie Blind.
