<h3>14. Babylon,<br/>
or,<br/>
The Bonnie Banks o Fordie</h3>

<p>P. 172 b. F&auml;r&ouml;e. Four versions are known; Lyngbye's
is repeated in Hammershaimb's F&aelig;r&oslash;sk Anthologi, No
13, p. 45, 'Torkils d&oslash;tur.'</p>

<p>173. 'La Fille d'un Cabaretier,' Guillon, Chansons pop. de
l'Ain, p. 165, has some of the circumstances of No 14. A girl is
stopped by three "libertins" in a wood. She gives them her ring
and her chain, to ransom her person. They say they will have that
too, and kill her when she resists. They then go for breakfast to
her father's tavern, and while they are paying their scot the
ring falls and is recognized by her mother. The youngest
confesses, and they are taken to the forest and burned.</p>

<p>In a Russian ballad the only sister of nine [seven] brothers
is given in marriage to a rich merchant, who lives at a distance
from her home. After three years the married pair undertake a
journey to her native place. On their way they are attacked by
nine robbers, who kill her husband, throw her child into the sea,
and act their pleasure with her. One of the nine, entering into
talk with the woman, discovers that she is his sister. Sakharof,
translated in Kalston's Songs of the Russian People, p. 49 f;
Ruibnikof, Part III, p. 340, No 62, Part IV, p. 99, No 19;
Hilferding, col. 149, No 28, col. 844, No 167, col. 1154, No 248,
col. 1265, No 294; Trudy, V, 910, No 479, <b>A</b>-<b>H</b>.</p>
