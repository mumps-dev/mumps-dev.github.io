<h3>Advertisement to part X</h3>

<p>For texts, information, or correction of errors, I have the
pleasure of expressing my indebtedness to the following gentlemen
in Europe: Mr. Andrew Lang; Mr. J.K. Hudson of Manchester;
Professsor J. Estlin Carpenter of Oxford; Messrs. W. Macmath and
David MacRitchie of Edinburgh; Mr. W. Walker of Aberdeen; Dr.
Axel Olrik of Copenhagen; and in America to the following ladies
and gentlemen: Miss Mary C. Burleigh of Massachusetts; Miss
Louise Porter Haskell of South Carolina; Professor Kittredge, Dr.
W.H. Schofield, Dr. W.P. Few and Mr. E.E. Griffith of Harvard
College; Professor W.U. Richardson of the Harvard Medical
School; Dr. F.A. Morrison of Indiana, and Mr. W.W. Newell,
editor of the Journal of American Folk-Lore. The services of Mr.
Leo Wiener of Harvard College have been at my full command in
Slavic matters, and had time been at my disposal would have been
employed for a much wider examination of the very numerous
collections of Slavic popular songs. Mr. G.F. Arnold, late of
Harvard College Library, obligingly undertook the general
bibliographical index at the end of this volume; but the labor
proving too great for his delicate health, this index was
completed by my friend Miss Catharine Innes Ireland, who besides
has generously devoted a great deal of time to the compilation or
correction of all the other indexes and the preparation of them
for the press. Still further favors are acknowledged elsewhere.
In conclusion I would recognize with thanks and admiration the
patience, liberality and consideration shown me by my publishers
from beginning to end.</p>

<p>[The manuscript of this Tenth and final Part of the English
and Scottish Ballads (including the Advertisement), was left by
Professor Child substantially complete, with the exception of the
Bibliography, and nearly ready for the press. The Bibliography,
which Miss Ireland had in hand at the time of Professor Child's
death, has been completed by her, with some assistance. In
accordance with Professor Child's desire, and at the request of
his family, I have seen the present Part through the press. My
own notes, except in the Indexes and Bibliography, are enclosed
within brackets, and have been confined, in the main, to entries
in the Additions and Corrections. Acknowledgments are due to Mr.
Macmath, Professor Lanman, and Dr. F.N. Robinson for various
contributions, and to Mr. W.R. Spalding for reading the
proof-sheets of the music. Mr. Leo Wiener, Instructor in Slavic
Languages in Harvard University, has had the great kindness to
revise the Slavic titles in the List of Ballads, the List of
Collections of Ballads, and the Bibliography. To Miss Ireland I
am especially indebted for material assistance of various kinds,
especially in the proof reading.</p>
