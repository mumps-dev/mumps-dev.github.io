<p>This is only a pseudo-chivalrous romance, tagged to Robin Hood
Newly Revived as a Second Part, with eight introductory stanzas.
Both parts are as vapid as possible, and no piquancy is
communicated by the matter of the two being as alien as oil and
water. The Prince of Aragon, a Turk and an infidel, has
beleaguered London, and will have the princess to his spouse,
unless three champions can vanquish him and his two giants. Robin
Hood, Scadlock, and John undertake the case, and disguise
themselves as pilgrims, so as not to be stopped on their way.
Robin kills the prince, and John and Scadlock each a giant. The
king demands to know who his deliverers are, and Robin Hood
avails himself of the opportunity to get the king's pardon for
himself and his men. The princess was to be the victor's prize,
but cannot marry all three, as might perhaps have been foreseen.
She is allowed to pick, and chooses Will Scadlock. The Earl of
Maxfield is present, and weeps bitterly at the sight of Scadlock,
because, he says, he had a son like Will, of the name of Young
Gamwell. Scadlock, whom we know from the First Part to be
Gamwell, falls at his father's feet, and the wedding follows.</p>
