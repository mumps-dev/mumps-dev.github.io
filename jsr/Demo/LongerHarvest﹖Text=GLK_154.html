<h3>154. A True Tale of Robin Hood</h3>

<p>Martin Parker's True Tale of Robin Hood was entered to Francis
Grove in the Stationers' Registers on the 29th of February, 1632.
A copy in the British Museum, which is here reprinted, is thought
to be of this first edition. The title of this copy is: 'A True
Tale of Robbin [Hood], or, A brief e touch of the life and death
o[f that] Renowned Outlaw, Robert. Earle of Huntin[gton] vulgarly
called Robbin Hood, who lived and died in [a.d.] 119S, being the
9. yeare of the reigne of King Ric[lrard] the first, commonly
called Richard Cuer de Lyon. Carefully collected out of the
truest Writers of our English C[hroni]cles. And published for the
satisfaction of those who desire to s[ee] Truth purged from
falsehood. By Martin Parker. Printed at London for T. Cotes, and
are to be sold by F. Grove dwellin[g] upon Snow-hill, neare the
Saracen [s head].'</p>

<p>Martin Parker professes in st. 117 to follow chronicles, not
"fained tales." Perhaps he regards broadside-ballads with
historical names in them as chronicles: at any rate, though he
reports some things which are found in Grafton, and in Major as
cited by Grafton, much the larger part of his True Tale is now to
be found only in ballads. When he does not agree with ballads
which have come down to us, he may have used earlier copies, or
he may have invented. The story of the abbot in sts. 23-26 is at
least from the same source as 'Robin Hood and the Bishop' (No,
143); the plundering of King Richard's receivers in st. 33 is
evidently the same event as that referred to in the second stanza
of 'Robin Hood and Queen Katheriue' (No, 145); Robin Hood is said
to have built eight almshouses in 71, and one in the last stanza
of 'The Noble Fisherman' (No, 148). The Gest could hardly have
been unknown to Parker. Sts. 3-9, concerning Robin's rank,
prodigality, and outlawry, may have been based upon Munday's
play; but. nothing is said of Maid Marian. Sts. 44-50 and 56-65
may report the substance of some lost broadside. Perhaps Parker
calls his compilation a True Tale because a tale of Robin Hood
was a proverb for an incredible story: "Tales of Robin Hood are
good for fools."</p>
