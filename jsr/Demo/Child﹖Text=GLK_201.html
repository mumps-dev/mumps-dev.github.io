<h3>201. Bessy Bell and Mary Gray</h3>

<p>This little ballad, or song, was very well known in the last
years of the seventeenth centnry. The first stanza was made by
Ramsay the beginning of a song of his own (Poems, Edinburgh,
1721, p. 80). The most important document relating to Bessy Bell
and Mary Gray is a letter written June, 1781, by Major Barry,
then proprietor of Lednock, and printed in the Transactions of
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, 11, 108, 1822. "When I
came first to Lednock," says Major Barry, "I was shewn in a part
of my ground (called the Dranoch-haugh) an heap of stones almost
covered with briers, thorns and fern, which they assured me was
the burial place of Bessie Bell and Mary Gray. The tradition of
the country relating to these ladys is, that Mary Gray's father
was laird of Lednock and Bessie Bell's of Kinvaid, a place in
this neighbourhood; that they were both very handsome, and an
intimate friendship subsisted between them; that while Miss Bell
was on a visit to Miss Gray, the plague broke out, in the year
1660; in order to avoid which they built themselves a bower about
three quarters of a mile west from Lednock House, in a very
retired and romantic place called Burn-braes, on the side of
Beauchieburn. Here they lived for some time; but the plague
raging with great fury, they caught the infection, it is said,
from a young gentleman who was in love with them both. He used to
bring them their provision. They died in this bower, and were
buried in the Dranoch-haugh, at the foot of a brae of the same
name, and near to the bank of the river Almond. The burial-place
lies about half a mile west from the present house of
Lednock."</p>

<p>Major Barry's date of 1666 should be put back twenty years.
Perth and the neighborhood (Lednock is seven miles distant) were
fearfully ravaged by the plague in 1645 and a year or two
following. Three thousand people are said to have perished.
Scotland escaped the pestilence of 1665-66.</p>

<p>Bessy Bell was made into a nursery-rhyme in England (see
Halliwell's Nursery Rhymes, 1874, No, 484).</p>
