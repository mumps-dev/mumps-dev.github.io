<h3>77. Sweet William's Ghost</h3>

<p>The story of this ballad seems to have become disordered in
most of the versions. <b>A</b> alone, the first published, has
perhaps retained the original form. The principal idea is,
however, preserved in all the full versions: the dead lover
returns to ask back his unfulfilled troth-plight. His grave is
wrongly said in <b>A</b> to be far beyond the sea. <b>B</b>
constitutes, in Herd's Manuscripts, and <b>F</b>, in Jamieson's
Popular Ballads, the termination of a copy of 'Clerk Saunders'
(No 69).</p>

<p>'Sweet William's Ghost' has much in common with one of the
most beautiful and celebrated of the Scandinavian ballads, 'The
Betrothed in the Grave' (Grundtvig, No. 90), and may well be a
different development of the same story. A man dies as he is to
be married. His love grieves for him passionately. The dead hears
her under the ground, comes to her bower with his coffin on his
back, and knocks. She lets him in after he has proved himself to
be "a spirit of health" by uttering the name of Jesus, combs his
hair, and asks him how it is under the black earth. It is like
the bliss of heaven. May she follow him into the grave? It is
like blackest hell. Every time she weeps for him his coffin is
filled with lappered blood. But when she sings and is happy, his
grave is all hung with rose-leaves. The cock crows, the white,
the red, the black; he takes up his coffin and goes wearily back
to the graveyard. His love follows through the mirk wood, to the
churchyard and into the church. Then his yellow hair falls away,
his rosy color wanes. He bids her go home and never weep for him
more. "Look up at the sky, the night is going!" and as she looks
he slips into his grave. She goes sadly home, prays God that she
may not live out a year and a day, falls sick, and dies within a
month. The Scandinavian ballad agrees in many particulars with
the conclusion of the second lay of Helgi Hundingsbani in the
Elder Edda.</p>
