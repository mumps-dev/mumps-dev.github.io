<h3>Sir Cawline</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Percy Manuscript, p. 568; Hales and Furnivall, III, 3. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d06101.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>The copy of this ballad in the Percy manuscript, the only one
known to exist, shows very great carelessness on the part of the
transcriber, or of some predecessor. It begins with these two
stanzas, which manifestly belong to an historical ballad, and
have only a verbal connection with what follows:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Jesus, lord mickle of might,<br/>
That dyed ffor us on the roode,<br/>
To maintaine vs in all our right<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d061_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a><br/>
That loues true English blood.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Ffor by a knight I say my song,<br/>
Was bold and ffull hardye;<br/>
Sir Robert Briuse wold fforth to flight,<br/>
In-to Ireland ouer the sea.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>There is a large omission after the 125th verse (the 28th
stanza as here printed), though the writing is continuous. There
are also several difficult or unintelligible passages, even more
than are usually met with in this manuscript.</p>

<p>As published in the Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, I, 35,
ed. 1765, I, 41, ed. 1794, 'Sir Cawline' is extended to nearly
twice the amount of what is found in the manuscript, and a
tragical turn is forced upon the story.</p>

<p>I have said that the copy of 'Sir Cawline' in the Percy
manuscript is the only one known. There are nevertheless two
Scottish ballads, one hitherto unpublished and one printed by
Buchan, which narrate Sir Colvin's winning the king's daughter by
vanquishing the elritch knight. These, I conceive, however, to be
simple rifacimenti of the ballad in Percy's Reliques. They will be
given in an appendix.</p>

<p>'Sir Cawline' may possibly be formed upon a romance in
stanzas<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d061_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> which itself was composed from earlier ballads.
There are two adventures in the ballad, one with an elritch
knight, and a second with a five-headed giant who is at the same
time a hend soldan, and there seem to be traces of another in the
now unintelligible twenty-ninth stanza. The first adventure,
though not of the same commonplace description as the second, is
still by no means unique. We are immediately reminded of the
beautiful romance of Eger, Grime and Gray. Steel: how Gray-Steel
kept a forbidden country beyond seven days of wilderness, and how
Grime slew the up to that time unmatched Gray-Steel with the
sword Erkyin [EgekingJ, brought from beyond the Greek&euml;s sea,
and cut off his hand, with fingers thrice a common man's size,
and on every finger a gay gold ring.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d061_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Gray-Steel, to be sure,
is pictured rather as a giant than an elf, but still gives the
impression of something out of the ordinary, as having perhaps
lost an elritch character in the course of tradition. The elritch
knight in our ballad haunts the moors, far from any good town,
like Grendel, who held the moors and fens, but there is only a
hint of that supernatural terror which attends the awful
"march-stepper" in Be&oacute;wulf. Gervase of Tilbury has a story
of an ancient entrenchment in the bishopric of Ely, where anybody
could have a passage at arms with an unearthly warrior, by
moonlight only, by simply calling out, "Come, knight, and meet
knight."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d061_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Scott has introduced a spectral combat of this sort
into his Marmion, Canto III, xxiii-xxv, and in a note (4) cites a
similar encounter from Heywood's Hierarchy of Blessed Angels. He
adds that a forest in the North Highlands is believed to be
haunted by a martial spirit called Lhamdearg, or Bloody Hand, who
insists on all whom he meets doing battle with him.
Villemarqu&eacute; has a tale like that of Gervasius, Les Romans
de la Table Ronde, etc., 1860, p. 392 f (Liebrecht). These
combatants and combats are rather shadowy compared with Grendel,
Gray-Steel, our Elritch King, and an encounter with them.</p>

<p>'Liden Grimmer og Hjelmer Kamp,' a ballad of the 'Orm
Ungersvend' class, Grundtvig, No 26 (I, 352, from manuscripts of
the 16th and the 17th century, IV, 762, from recent tradition),
has the same remote and general resemblance to 'Sir Cawline' that
'Orm Ungersvend' has to '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_60.html">King Estmere</a>,' the points of agreement
permitting the supposition of a far-off connection, or of no
connection at all.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d061_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In Danish <b>A</b>, Grimmer, a young man
who never went to a dance except with a drawn sword in his hand
or sat down to table out of his corselet, sails to the
heathen-king's land and asks him for his daughter. The king tells
him that he will not get the fair maid unless he fights with
Hjelmer Kamp and wins. The king's daughter, who is as favorably
inclined to Grimmer as King Adland's daughter is to Estmere (and
King Ardine's daughter to Adler), though in neither case has
there been a previous meeting, tells him that no man ever came
back from a fight with Hjelmer, and that Grimmer is far from
understanding her father, who really wishes his death. Grimmer is
not at all daunted, and so the lady gives him a sword with which
he is sure to prevail. Thus equipped he makes sail for Hjelmer
Kamp, who receives him with contemptuous remarks upon his size,
but is presently cut to bits. Stopping only long enough to make
boot of Hjelmer's gold, Grimmer returns to the heathen-king's
court, and receives the princess in marriage. The resemblance of
the Danish ballad is to be found in Cawline's second adventure,
that with the giant, where the elritch sword represents the
invincible weapon bestowed by the princess. In Danish <b>B</b> a
coat of mail goes with the sword, "som icke skal suerd paa bide."
This coat is like Estmere's after Adler has brought his magic to
bear, and Cawline's fight with the giant, Estmere's with Bremor,
and Hjelmer's with the kemp have all an obvious similitude.</p>

<p>Two verbal peculiarities in this ballad will not fail to be
remarked: a superfluous <i>and</i>, 7<sup>4</sup>, without and a
good leedginge, 8<sup>3</sup>, and take you doe and the baken
bread, 27<sup>1</sup>, and hee tooke then vp and that eldryge
sword, 39<sup>1</sup>, but take you doo and your lands broad, and
again 26<sup>1</sup> (?); <i>for</i> used, apparently, in the
sense of <i>but</i> (as in "for and a shrouding sheet"),
11<sup>3</sup>, ffor if you wold comfort me with a kisse,
13<sup>3</sup>, ffor some deeds of armes ffaine wold I doe,
22<sup>5</sup>, ffor they tooke and two good swords; in this last
we have the superfluous <i>and</i> again. These were, perhaps,
only tricks of some ballad-singer, eking out his measure with
half-articulated syllables.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d061_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Percy's ballad is translated by Bodmer, I, 134, and by Bothe,
p. 25; Buchan's by Gerhard, p. 32.</p>
