<p><b>b</b>, says Motherwell, "is given as it occurs in early
stall-prints, and as it is to be obtained from the recitations of
elderly people." Most of the variations are derived from
<b>d</b>. <b>c</b> may have been printed earlier than <b>a</b>,
but is astonishingly faulty, <b>d</b>, well remembered from
print, is what Motherwell meant by "the recitations of elderly
people." <b>e</b> was obtained by Herd, probably from recitation,
as early as 1776, but must have been learned from print, <b>f</b>
is <b>e</b> with a few missing lines supplied, <b>g</b>, says
Pinkerton, "is given from a modern edition in one sheet 12mo,"
but was beyond question considerably manipulated by the editor.
All the important variations are certainly his work.</p>

<p>The copy in Buchan's Gleanings, p. 9, is <b>g</b>. Whitelaw,
in his Book of Scotish Ballads, p. 39, has combined <b>b</b> and
<b>g</b>.</p>

<p>Half a dozen lines preserved by Burns, Cromek's Select Scotish
Songs, II, 196 (see the preface to No 212), seem to belong to
this ballad.</p>

<p>'Sir James the Ross, A Historical Ballad' (sometimes called
'The Buchanshire Tragedy'), was composed by the youthful Michael
Bruce (&#8224; 1767) upon the story of the popular ballad, and
has perhaps enjoyed more favor with "the general" than the
original.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d213_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> 'Elfrida and Sir James of Perth,' Caw's Poetical
Museum, 1784, p. 290 (probably taken, as most of the pieces are
by the collector said to be, from some periodical publication),
looks more like an imitation of Bruce's ballad than of its
prototype. It is in fact a stark plagiarism.</p>

<p>Sir James the Rose has killed a squire, and men are out to
take him. A nurse at the house of Marr is his leman, and he
resorts to her in the hope that she may befriend him. She advises
him to go to an ale-house for the night, promising to meet him
there in the morning; he says he will do so, but, perhaps from
distrust, which proves to be well grounded, prefers to wrap
himself in his plaid and sleep under the sky. The party sent out
to take him question the nurse, who at first makes a deceptive
answer, then gives them a direction to his hiding-place. They
find James the Rose asleep and take away his arms; he wakes and
begs for mercy, and is told that he shall have such as he has
given. He appeals to his servant to stay by him till death, and
then to take his body to Loch Largan (Loughargan), for which
service the man shall have his clothes and valuables. The
avengers cut out his heart and take it to his leman at the house
of Marr; she raves over her treachery, and is 'born away' bodily,
to be seen no more.</p>

<p><b>e</b>, <b>f</b>, it may be by accident, lack the vulgar
passage 18, 19, which may be a later addition, for nothing is
said of a man being in attendance when Sir James goes to his
lair. The leader of the band that takes Sir James the Rose is Sir
James the Graham, Sir James Graham, in <b>c</b>, <b>e</b>,
<b>f</b>; a simple error, evidently. No motive is furnished in
<b>a</b>-<b>f</b> for the woman's betraying her leman. <b>g</b>
makes her offer in formation on condition of getting a proper
reward, and she is promised Sir James's purse and brechan, but in
the end is tendered his bleeding heart and his bleeding tartan,
what ever that may be other than his brechan. This must be one of
Pinkerton's improvements. The moral tag, st. 24, is dropped, or
wanting, in <b>c</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>g</b>.</p>

<p>The topography of traditional ballads frequently presents
difficulties, both because it is liable to be changed, wholly,
or, what is more embarrassing, partially, to suit a locality to
which a ballad has been transported, and again because unfamiliar
names, when not exchanged, are exposed to corruption. Some of the
places, also, have not a dignity which entitles them to notice in
gazetteers. The first point, in the case before us, would be to
settle the whereabouts of the House of Marr, in the vicinity of
which the scene is laid. This I am unable to do. There is a
Ballechin in Logierait Parish, Perthshire. There is said to be a
Baleichan in Forfarshire.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d213_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It is not easy to see why the heir
of either of these places (Buleighan and the rest may stand for
either) should wish to have his body taken to Loch Largon in
Invernesshire, if Loch Largon means Loch Laggan, as seems
likely.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d213_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
