<h3>182. The Laird o Logie</h3>

<p>Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, a madcap cousin of James
VI, had been guilty of a violent assault upon Holy rood House in
December (or September), 1591, and in June, 1592, had "conspired
the apprehension of the king's person" while James was residing
at Falkland. A confederate, Wemyss of Logie, was arrested and
"ordained to be tried by an assize and executed to the death. But
the same night that he was examined, he escaped out by the means
of a gentlewoman whom he loved, a Dane, who conveyed him out of
his keepers' hands, through the queen's chamber, where his
Majesty and the queen were lying in their beds, to a window in
the backside of the place, where he went down upon a tow [rope],
and shot three pistols in token of his onlouping [mounting his
horse] where some of his servants, with the laird of Niddry, were
awaiting him." (Moysie's Memoirs, p. 95.) According to another
account, the gentlewoman got Logie out of his keepers' hands by
pretending that the king wished to speak with him, and they,
"suspecting nothing, for they knew her to be the principal maid
in the chamber, conveyed him to the door of the bedchamber" and
waited there while she was letting him down at a window. Though
the queen had no hand in the freeing of Young Logie, she stood by
her Danish attendant, and appears to have pacified the king.
Logie was pardoned and married the gentlewoman. Her name was
really Margaret, as in the ballad.</p>
