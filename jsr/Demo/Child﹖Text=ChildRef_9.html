<p>The earliest copy of this ballad is introduced as 'The
Maidens' Song,'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d009_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in Deloney's Pleasant History of John
Winchcomb, in his younger yeares called Jacke of Newberie, a book
written as early as 1597. Mr Halliwell reprinted the " 9th"
edition, of the date 1633,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d009_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in 1859, and the ballad is found
at p. 61 of the reprint (<b>A</b>). The copy in Ritson's Ancient Songs,
1790, p. 169, has a few variations, which are probably to be
explained by Ritson having used some other edition of Deloney.
Ritson's text is used in The Borderer's
<a name="Page_I_112"/>
Table Book, VI, 25, and
was taken thence into Sheldon's Minstrelsy of the English Border,
with some arbitrary alterations. The ballad was formerly popular
in Scotland. Kinloch and Buchan printed B and C with some slight
changes; the texts are now given as they stand in the
manuscripts. E, a traditional version from the English border,
has unfortunately been improved by some literary pen.</p>

<p>An English lady is prevailed upon to release a Scot from
prison, and to fly with him, on the promise of being made his
wife, and (<b>A</b>) lady of castles and towers. She takes much
gold with her (<b>A</b>), and a swift steed (two, <b>A</b>).
According to <b>A</b> they come to a rough river; the lady is
alarmed, but swims it, and is wet from top to toe. On coming
within sight of Edinburgh, the faithless knight bids her choose
whether she will be his paramour or go back: he has wife and
children. She begs him to draw his sword and end her shame: he
takes her horse away, and leaves her. Two English knights come
by, who restore her to her father. The dismissal takes place at
the Scottish cross and moor in <b>B</b>; at a moor and a moss,
<b>C</b>; at Scotland bridge, <b>D</b>; at a fair Scottish cross,
<b>B</b>. She offers to be servant in his kitchen rather than go
back, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>; begs him to throw her into
the water, <b>D</b>; from his castle wall, <b>E</b>. He fees an
old man to take her home on an old horse, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>.</p>

<p>We do not find the whole of this story repeated among other
European nations, but there are interesting agreements in parts
with Scandinavian, Polish,- and German ballads.</p>

<p>There is some resemblance in the first half to a pretty ballad
of the northern nations which treats in a brief way the theme of
our exquisite romance of 'The Nutbrown Maid:' Danish, 'Den
Trofaste Jomfru,' Grundtvig, No 249, rv, 494, nine copies,
<b>A</b>-<b>I</b>, the first three from 16th or 17th century
manuscripts, the others from tradition of this century, as are
also the following: <b>K</b>-<b>M</b>, 'Den Fredl&oslash;se,'
Kristensen, n, 191, No 57: Swedish, 'De sju Gullbergen,'
<b>A</b>, Afzelius, No 79, in, 71, new ed., No 64, I, 322;

the same tale. A knight carries off a maid on his horse, making
her magnificent promises, among which are eight gold castles,
Dan. <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>; one,
<b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>; eight, Norw. <b>A</b>; nine, Norw.
<b>B</b>; seven, Swed. <b>B</b>; seven gold mountains, Swed.

She gets her gold together while he is saddling his horse, Dan.
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>M</b>; Swed.
<b>A</b>; Norw. <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. They come to a sea-strand or
other water, it is many miles to the nearest land, Dan. <b>B</b>,
<b>D</b>, Swed. <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>; the lady wishes she were at
home, Dan. <b>E</b>, <b>P</b>, Swed. <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. He swims
the horse across, Dan. <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,

<b>B</b>, <b>C</b> [part of the way, having started in a boat,
Norw. <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>]. The maid wrings her clothes, Dan.
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>; Swed. <b>A</b>; Norw.
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. She asks, Where are the gold castles which
you promised? Dan. <b>C</b> 7, <b>D</b> 14, <b>K</b> 9, <b>L</b>
7, <b>M</b> 8; Norw. <b>A</b> 22, <b>B</b> 16.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d009_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> He tells her
that he has no gold castle but this green turf, Dan. <b>C</b> 8;
he needs none but the black ground and thick wood, Dan. <b>K</b>
10: he is a penniless, banished man. She offers him her gold to
buy him a charter of peace. In all, except Dan. <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and the incomplete Dan. <b>I</b>, Norw.
<b>B</b>, he goes on to say that he has plighted faith to another
woman, and she meekly replies, Then I will be your servant. He
continues the trial no further, reveals himself as of wealth and
rank, says that she shall have ladies to wait on her, and makes
her his queen. The knight is king of England in Dan. <b>B</b>,
<b>H</b>, King Henry, simply, in Dan. <b>F</b>. The gold castles
prove to be realities: there is in Dan. <b>E</b> even one more
than was promised.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d009_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The Polish ballads of the class of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_4.html">Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight</a>
' (see p. 39 f) have thus much in common with 'The Fair
Flower of Northumberland:' a maid is induced to go off with a man
on horseback, and takes gold with her; after going a certain
distance, he bids her return home; in <b>AA</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>R</b>, he gives her her choice whether to return or to jump
into the river; she prefers death (cf. <b>D</b> 3, 5, p. 116); in
all they finally come to a river, or other water, into which he
throws her.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d009_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>There is a German ballad which has some slight connection with
all the foregoing, and a very slight story it is altogether:
'Stolz Heinrich,' Simrock, No 9, p. 23, 'Stolz Syburg,'
Reiffenberg, No 16, p. 32, No 17, p. 34, from the Lower Rhine and
M&uuml;nster; made over, in Kretzschmer, I, 187, No 106. Heinrich, or
Syburg, wooes a king's daughter in a distant land. He asks her to
go with him, and says he has seven mills in his country. "Tell me
what they grind," says Margaret, "and I will go with you." The
mills grind sugar and cinnamon, mace and cloves. They come to a
green heath. Margaret thinks she sees the mills gleaming: he
tells her that a green heath is all he has. "Then God have mercy
that I have come so far," she says; draws a sword, kneels before
him, and stabs herself.</p>

<p>The ballad of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_48.html">Young Andrew</a>,' further on, has points in common
with 'The Fair Flower of Northumberland.'</p>

<p><b>C</b> is translated by Rosa Warrens, Schottische Lieder der
Vorzeit, No 31, p. 137.</p>
