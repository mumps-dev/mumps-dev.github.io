<p>Thomas of Erceldoune, otherwise Thomas the Rhymer, and in the
popular style True Thomas, has had a fame as a seer, which,
though progressively narrowed, is, after the lapse of nearly or
quite six centuries, far from being extinguished. The common
people throughout the whole of Scotland, according to Mr. Robert
Chambers (1870), continue to regard him with veneration, and to
preserve a great number of his propbetic sayings, which they
habitually seek to connect with "dear years" and other notable
public events.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A prediction of Thomas of Erceldoune's is
recorded in a manuscript which is put at a date before 1320, and
he is referred to with other soothsayers in the Scalacronica, a
French chronicle of English history begun in 1355. Erceldoune is
spoken of as a poet in Robert Mannyng's translation of Langtoft's
chronicle, finished in 1338; and in the Auchinleck copy of 'Sir
Tristrem,' said to have been made about 1350, a Thomas is said to
have been consulted at Er&thorn;eldoun touching the history of
Tristrem. So that we seem safe in holding that Thomas of
Erceldoune had a reputation both as prophet and poet in the
earlier part of the fourteenth century. The vaticinations of
Thomas are cited by various later chroniclers, and had as much
credit in England as in Scotland. "During the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries," says Chambers, "to fabricate
a prophecy in the name of Thomas the Rhymer appears to have been
found a good stroke or policy on many occasions. Thus was his
authority employed to countenance the views of Edward III against
Scottish independence, to favor the ambitious views of the Duke
of Albany in the minority of James V, and to sustain the spirits
of the nation under the harassing invasions of Henry VIII."
During the Jacobite rising of 1745 the accomplishment of Thomas's
as then unfulfilled predictions was looked for by many. His
prophecies, and those of other Scotch soothsayers, were
consulted, says Lord Hailes, "with a weak if not criminal
curiosity." Even as late as the French revolutionary war a rhyme
of Thomas's caused much distress and consternation in the border
counties of Scotland, where people were fearing an invasion. The
'Whole Prophecie' of Merlin, Thomas Rymour, and others, collected
and issued as early as 1603, continued to be printed as a
chap-book down to the beginning of this century, when, says Dr.
Murray, few farm-houses in Scotland were without a copy of it.</p>

<a name="Page_I_318"/>
<p>All this might have been if Thomas of Erceldoune had been not
more historical than Merlin. But the name is known to have
belonged to a real person. Thomas Rymor de Ercildune is witness
to a deed whereby one Petrus de Haga obliges himself to make a
certain payment to the Abbey of Melrose. Petrus de Haga is, in
turn, witness to a charter made by Richard de Moreville.
Unluckily, neither of these deeds is dated. But Moreville was
constable of Scotland from 1162 to 1189. If we suppose
Moreville's charter to have been given towards 1189, and Haga to
have been then about twenty years old, and so born about 1170, and
further suppose Haga to have made his grant to Melrose towards
the end of a life of threescore, or three score and ten, the time
of Thomas Rymer's signature would be about 1230 or 1240. If
Thomas Rymer was then twenty years of age, his birth would have
been at 1210 or 1220. In the year 1294 Thomas de Ercildoun, son
and heir of Thomas Rymour de Ercildoun, conveyed to a religious
house his inheritance of lands in Ercildoun. With Thomas Rhymer
in mind, one naturally interprets Thomas Rymour as the prophet
and Thomas de Ercildoun as his son. If Rymour was the surname of
this family,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> it would have been better, for us at least, if
the surname had been subjoined to the first Thomas also. As the
language stands, we are left to choose among several
possibilities. Thomas the Rhymer may have been dead in 1294;
Thomas Rymour, meaning the same person, may have made this
cession of lands in 1294, and have survived still some years.
Thomas, the father, may, as Dr. Murray suggests, have retired from
the world, but still be living, and it may be his son who resigns
the lands. Blind Harry's Life of Wallace makes Thomas Rimour to
be alive down to 1296 or 1297. A story reported by Bower in his
continuation of Fordun, c. 1430, makes Thomas to have predicted
the death of Alexander III in 1286, when, according to the
previous (necessarily very loose) calculation, the seer would
have been between sixty-six and seventy-six. Neither of these
last dates is established by the strongest evidence, but there is
no reason for refusing to admit, at least, that Thomas of
Erceldoune may have been alive at the latter epoch.</p>

<p>Thomas of Erceldoune's prophetic power was a gift of the queen
of the elves; the modern elves, equally those of northern Europe
and of Greece, resembling in respect to this attribute the nymphs
of the ancient Hellenic mythology. How Thomas attained this grace
is set forth in the first of three fits of a poem which bears his
name. This poem has come down in four somewhat defective copies:
the earliest written a little before the middle of the fifteenth
century, two others about 1450, the fourth later. There is a
still later manuscript copy of the second and third fits.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
All the manuscripts are English, but it is manifest from the
nature of the topics that the original poem was the work of a
Scotsman. All four of the complete versions speak of an older
story: "gyff it be als the storye sayes, v. 83, 'als the storye
tellis full ryghte,' v. 123. The older story, if any, must be the
work of Thomas. The circumstance that the poem, as we have it,
begins in the first person, and after a long passage returns for
a moment to the first person, though most of the tale is told in
the third, is of no importance; nor would it have been important
if the whole narrative had been put into Thomas's mouth, since
that is the simplest of literary artifices.</p>

<p>Thomas, having found favor with the queen of Elfland, was
taken with her to that country, and there he remained more than
three [seven] years. Then the time came round when a tribute had
to be paid to hell, and as Thomas was too likely to be chosen by
the fiend, the elf queen conducted him back to the world of men.
At the moment of parting Thomas desires some token which may
authenticate his havillg spoken with her. She gives him the
<a name="Page_I_319"/>
gift
of soothsaying. He presses her to stay and tell him some ferly.
Upon this she begins a train of predictions, which Thomas more
than once importunes her to continue. The first two of these, the
failure of Baliol's party and the battle of Halidon Hill, 1333,
stand by themselves, but they are followed by a series in
chronological order, extending from the battle of Falkirk to the
battle of Otterbourn, 1298-1388. The third fit, excepting,
perhaps, a reference to Henry IV's invasion of Scotland in 1401,
seems to consist, not of predictions made after the event, but of
"adaptations of legendary prophecies, traditionally preserved
from far earlier times, and furbished up anew at each period of
national trouble and distress, in expectation of their fulfilment
being at length at hand."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The older "story," which is twice referred to in the prologue
to the prophecies of Thomas of Erceldoune, was undoubtedly a
romance which narrated the adventure of Thomas with the elf queen
<i>simply</i>, without specification of his prophecies. In all
probability it concluded, in accordance with the ordinary popular
tradition, with Thomas's return to fairy-land after a certain
time passed in this world.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> For the story of Thomas and the
Elf-queen is but another version of what is related of Ogier le
Danois and Morgan the Fay. Six fairies made gifts to Ogier at his
birth. By the favor of five he was to be the strongest, the
bravest, the most successful, the handsomest, the most
susceptible, of knights: Morgan's gift was that, after a long and
fatiguing career of glory, he should live with her at her castle
of Avalon, in the enjoyment of a still longer youth and never
wearying pleasures. When Ogier had passed his hundredth year,
Morgan took measures to carry out her promise. She had him
wrecked, while he was on a voyage to France, on a loadstone rock
conveniently near to Avalon, which Avalon is a little way this
side of the terrestrial paradise. In due course he comes to an
orchard, and there he eats an apple, which affects him so
peculiarly that he looks for nothing but death. He turns to the
east, and sees a beautiful lady, magnificently attired. He takes
her for the Virgin; she corrects his error, and announces herself
as Morgan the Fay. She puts a ring on his finger which restores
his youth, and then places a crown on his head which makes him
forget all the past. For two hundred years Ogier lived in such
delights as no worldly being can imagine, and the two hundred
years seemed to him but twenty. Christendom was then in danger,
and even Morgan thought his presence was required in the world.
The crown being taken from his head, the memory of the past
revived, and with it the desire to return to France. He was sent
back by the fairy, properly provided, vanquished the foes of
Christianity in a short space, and after a time was brought back
by Morgan the Fay to Avalon.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The fairy adventures of Thomas and of Ogier have the essential
points in common, and even the particular trait that the fairy is
taken to be the Virgin. The occurrence of this trait again in the
ballad, viewed in connection with the general similarity of the
two, will leave no doubt that the ballad had its source in the
<a name="Page_I_320"/>
romance. Yet it is an entirely popular ballad as to style,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
and must be of considerable age, though the earliest version
(<b>A</b>) can be traced at furthest only into the first half of
the last century.</p>

<p>The scene of the meeting of Thomas with the elf queen is
Huntly Banks and the Eildon Tree in versions <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>
of the ballad, as in the romance.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Neither of these is
mentioned in <b>A</b>, the reciter of which was an Aberdeen
woman. The elf-lady's costume and equipment, minutely given in
the romance (henceforth referred to as <b>R</b>), are reduced in
the ballad to a skirt of grass-green silk and a velvet mantle,
<b>A</b>, and a dapple-gray horse, <b>B</b> 2 (<b>R</b> 5), with
nine and fifty bells on each tett of its mane, <b>A</b> 2 (three
bells on either side of the bridle, <b>R</b> 9).<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Thomas
salutes the fairy as queen of heaven, <b>A</b> 3, <b>R</b> 11.
<b>B</b> 3 has suffered a Protestant alteration which makes
nonsense of the following stanza. She corrects his mistake in
all, and in <b>B</b> 4 tells him she is out hunting, as in
<b>R</b> 16. As <b>C</b> 5 stands, she challenges Thomas to kiss
her, warning him at the same time, unnaturally, and of course in
consequence of a corrupt reading, of the danger; which Thomas
defies, <b>C</b> 6. These two stanzas in <b>C</b> represent the
passage in the romance, 17-21, in which Thomas embraces the fairy
queen, and are wanting in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, though not to be
spared. It is contact with the fairy that gives her the power to
carry her paramour off; for carry him off she does, and he is in
great fright at having to go. The ballad is no worse, and the
romance would have been much better, for the omission of another
passage, impressive in itself, but incompatible with the proper
and original story. The elf-queen had told Thomas that he would
ruin her beauty, if he had his will, and so it came to pass: her
eyes seemed out, her rich clothing was away, her body was like
the lead; and it is while thus disfigured that she bids Thomas
take leave of sun and moon, so that his alarm is not without
reasoll.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> He must go with her for seven years, <b>A</b>,

they cross a water, he wading up
to the knee, <b>B</b>, <b>R</b>. The water is subterranean in
<b>R</b>, and for three days naught is heard but the soughing of
the flood. Then they come to an orchard, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>R</b>, and Thomas, like to tyne for lack of food, is about to
pull fruit, but is told that the fruit is cursed, <b>A</b> 9,
<b>B</b> 8;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> if he plucks it, his soul goes to the fire of
hell, <b>R</b> 35. The fairy has made a provision of safe bread
and wine for him in the ballad, <b>A</b> 10, <b>B</b> 9, but he
has still to fast a while in the romance. <b>C</b>, which lacks
this passage, makes them ride till they reach a wide desert, and
leave living land behind, 9; and here (but in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
and <b>R</b> in the vicinity of the orchard) the fairy bids
Thomas lay his head on her knee, and she will show him rare
sights. These are the way to heaven, <b>A</b> 12, <b>B</b> 11,
<b>R</b> 38; the way to hell, <b>A</b> 13, <b>B</b> 10, <b>R</b>
41; the road to Elfland, whither they are going, <b>A</b> 14.
<b>R</b> does not point out the road to Elfland, but the
elf-queen's castle on a high hill; and there are two additional
ferlies, the way to paradise and the way to purgatory,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> 39,
40. Thomas, in <b>A</b>. 15, is now admonished that he must hold
his tongue, for if he speaks a word he will never get back to his
own country; in <b>R</b> 44 he is told to answer none but the
elf-queen, whatever may be said to him, and this course he takes
in <b>B</b> 12. But before they proceed to the castle the lady
resumes all the beauty and splendor which she had lost, and no
explanation is offered save the naive one in the Lansdowne copy,
that if she had not, the king, her consort, would have known that
she had been in fault. Now follows in <b>A</b> 15 (as recited,
here 7), <b>C</b> 15, 16, the passage through the subterranean
water, which should come before they reach the orchard, as in
<b>B</b> 6, <b>R</b> 30, 31. There is much exaggeration in the
ballad: they wade through rivers in darkness and hear the sea
roaring, <b>C</b> 15, <b>A</b> 7, as in <b>R</b>, but they also
wade through red blood to the knee, <b>A</b> 7, <b>C</b> 16, and
the crossing occupies not three days, as in <b>R</b> 31, but
forty days, <b>A</b> 7. In <b>C</b> they now come to the garden.
Stanzas 15, 16 are out of place in <b>C</b>, as just remarked,
and 17 is entirely perverted. The cursed fruit which Thomas is not
to touch in <b>A</b> 9, <b>B</b> 8, <b>R</b> 35, is offered him
by the elf-queen as his wages, and will give him the tongue that
can never lie, &mdash; a gift which is made him in the romance at
the beginning of the second fit, when the fairy is preparing to
part with him. Stanzas 18, 19 of <b>C</b> are certainly a modern,
and as certainly an ill-devised, interpolation. <b>B</b> has lost
the conclusion. In <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, Thomas gets a fairy
costume, and is not seen on earth again for seven years.</p>

<p>The romance, after some description of the life at the
elf-castle, informs us that Thomas lived there more than three
years [Cambridge Manuscript, seven], and thought the time but a
space of three days, an almost moderate illusion compared with
the experience of other mortals under analogous
circumstances.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The fairy queen then hurried him away, on
the eve of the day when the foul fiend was to come to fetch his
tribute. He was a mickle man and hend, and there was every reason
to fear that he would be chosen. She brought him again to Eldon
Tree, and was bidding bim farewell. Thomas begged of her a token
of his conversation with her, and she gave him the gift of true
speaking. He urged her further to tell him some ferly, and she
made him several predictions, but he would not let her go without
more and more. Finally, with a promise to meet him on Huntly
Banks when she might, she left him under the tree.</p>

<a name="Page_I_322"/>
<p>Popular tradition, as Sir Walter Scott represents, held that,
though Thomas was allowed to revisit the earth after a seven
years' sojourn in fairy-land, he was under an obligation to go
back to the elf-queen whenever she should summon him. One day
while he "was making merry with his friends in the town of
Erceldoune, a person came running in, and told, with marks of
fear and astonishment, that a hart and hind had left the
neighboring forest, and were composedly and slowly parading the
street of the village. The prophet instantly arose, left his
habitation, and followed the wonderful animals to the forest,
whence he was never seen to return." He is, however, expected to
come back again at some future time.</p>

<p>What we learn from the adventures of Thomas concerning the
perils of dealing with fairies, and the precautions to be
observed, agrees with the general teaching of tradition upon the
subject. In this matter there is pretty much one rule for all
"unco" folk, be they fairies, dwarfs, water-sprites, devils, or
departed spirits, and, in a limited way, for witches, too.
Thomas, having kissed the elf-queen's lips, must go with her.
When the dead Willy comes to ask back his faith and troth of
Margaret, and she says he must first kiss her, cheek and chin, he
replies, "If I should kiss your red, red lips, your days would
not be long."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> When Thomas is about to pull fruit in the

rescue his sister, who had been carried off by the king of
Elfland, his sage adviser enjoins him to eat and drink nothing in
fairy-land, whatever his hunger or thirst; "for if he tasted or
touched in Elfland, he must remain in the power of the elves, and
never see middle-eard again."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_017','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Abstinence from speech is

<p>That eating and drinking, personal contact, exchange of
speech, receiving of gifts, in any abode of unearthly beings,
including the dead, will reduce a man to their fellowship and
condition might be enforced by a great number of examples, and
has already been abundantly shown by Professor Wilhelm

shown than anywbere else in Saxo's
account of King Gormo's visit to Guthmund, and it will be enough
to cite that. The Danish King Gormo, having heard extraordinary
things of the riches of Geruth (the giant Geirr&ouml;&eth;r),
determines to verify the reports with his own eyes, under the
guidance of Thorkill, from whom he has received them. The land of
Geruth is far to the northeast, beyond the sun and stars, and
within the realm of Chaos and Old Night. It is, in fact, a very
dismal and terrific sort of Hades. The way to it lies through the
dominion of Guthmund, Geruth's brother, which is described as a
paradise, but a paradise of the same dubious attractions as that
in Thomas of Erceldoune. Guthmund, himself a giant, receives the
travellers, a band of about three hundred, very graciously, and
conducts them to his palace. Thorkill takes his comrades apart,
and puts them on their guard: they must eat and drink nothing
that is offered them, but live on the provisions which they have
brought, must keep off from the people of the place and not touch
them; if they partake of any of the food, they will forget
everything, and have to pass their lives in this foul society.
Guthmund complains that they slight his hospitality, but
Thorkill, now and always, has an excuse ready. The genial monarch
offers Gormo one of his twelve beautiful daughters in marriage,
and their choice of wives to all the rest of the train. Most of
the Danes like the proposition, but Thorkill renews his warnings.
Four take the bait, and lose all recollection of the past.
Guthmund now commends the delicious fruits of his garden, and
tries every art to make the king taste them. But he is again
foiled by Thorkill, and clearly perceiving that he has met his
match, transports the travellers over the river which separates
him and his brother, and allows them to continue their
journey.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d037_019','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
