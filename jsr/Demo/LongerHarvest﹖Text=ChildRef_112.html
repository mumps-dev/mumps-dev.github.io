<p><b>A</b> <b>b</b> is in the first volume of the editions of
1698, 1707: Chappell, Popular Music, p. 62. <b>B</b> is in the
third volume of the edition of 1707, and is also printed in A
Complete Collection of Old and New English and Scotch Songs, 8vo,
1735, which I have not seen: Chappell, p. 520.</p>

<p>The original story, represented by <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and
<b>C</b> 1-17, appears to have been revived at the end of the
seventeenth century, and to have been so much relished as to
encourage the addition of a Second, Third, and Fourth Part, all
of which were afterwards combined, as in <b>C</b> <b>a</b>,
<b>c</b>, <b>d</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d112_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Percy inserted a version of <b>C</b>, abridged to forty-five
stanzas, in his Reliques, 1765, III, 238, 1767, II, 339, which
was "given, with some corrections,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d112_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> from a Manuscript copy,
and collated with two printed ones in Roman character in the
Pepys collection." Although "Manuscript copy" in Percy's case may
mean nothing, while "some corrections" may signify much, it has
been thought best to reprint Percy's ballad in an Appendix.</p>

<p><b>D</b> is repeated in Johnson's Museum, p. 490, No 477, with
a slight change in the first line. It probably belongs to the
first half of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p><b>E</b> is, in all probability, a broadside copy modified by
tradition. In <b>B</b>, as in two stanzas appended to <b>B</b>
(see notes), and in a rifacimento immediately to be mentioned,
the all but too politic maid would certainly seem to be
encouraging the knight at first.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d112_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>'The Politick Maid,' Roxburghe Ballads, I, 306 f, Ballad
Society reprint, II, 281, is an edition, after Percy's fashion,
of some old form of the ballad, by Richard Climsell (Chappell).
It was printed for Thomas Lambert, whose date, according to Mr.
Chappell, is 1636-41, and is, therefore, considerably earlier
than any known copy of the First Part of <b>C</b>. For the sake
of such portions of the original as it preserves, it is given in
an Appendix.'</p>

<p>There is a Scottish ballad in which the tables are turned upon
the maid in the conclusion. This, as being of comparatively
recent, and not of popular, but of low literary origin, cannot be
admitted here. It can be found in Kinloch's Ballad Book, 'Jock
Sheep,' p. 16, and the Kinloch Manuscripts, I, 229, communicated
by James Beattie as taken down from the recitation of Miss E.
Beattie, Mearnsshire. Other versions are, in the Campbell
Manuscripts, 'Dernie Hughie,' II, 233; 'Jock Sheep, or, The
Maiden Outwitted,' Buchan Manuscripts, 1, 155. Another ballad,
brief and silly, in which a maid ties a gentleman's hands with
her apron strings, 'The Abashed Knight,' Buchan's Ballads of the
North of Scotland, II, 131, is rejected on similar grounds.</p>

<p>The important points in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and the first part
of <b>C</b> are that a knight, coming upon a damsel at a distance
from her home, desires to have his will of her. She asks him to
take her to her father's hall, where he shall be gratified.
Reaching the house, she slips in and leaves the knight without.
She jeers at him for not using his opportunity.</p>

<p>A similar story occurs in many European ballads.</p>

<p><b>Spanish</b>. <b>A</b>. 'De Francia parti&oacute; la
ni&ntilde;a,' "Cancionero de Romances, s. a., fol. 259, Can. de
Rom. 1550, fol. 274, Silva de 1550, I, fol. 184;" 'La Infantina,'
Duran, I, 152, No 284, Wolf y Hofmann, Primavera, II, 82, No 154.
A damsel on the way to Paris has lost the road, and is waiting
under a tree for an escort. A knight rides by, and she asks him
to take, her along. He puts her on the crupper, and, when midway,
asks for <i>amores</i>. The damsel tells him that she is a leper (hija
de un malato y de una malat&iacute;a), which frightens the knight
to silence. As they are entering Paris the damsel laughs, and the
knight asks why; she laughs at the knight's want of spirit. He
proposes to go back for something which he has forgotten. She
will not turn back; she is daughter to the king of France, and
any man who should touch her would pay dearly for it. <b>B</b>.
Another copy, from a broadside of the sixteenth century, Duran,
I, 152, No 285, Primavera, II, 83, No 154 a, blends the story
with that of a princess who has been made to pass seven years in
a wood by a fairy's spell, 'A cazar va el caballero,' 'La Infanta
encantada,' Duran, I, 159, No 295, Primavera, II, 74, No 151.
<b>C</b>. 'El Caballero burlado,' from Asturian tradition, Amador
de los Rios, Historia de la Litteratura espa&ntilde;ola, VII, 442.</p>

through by a knight, <b>B</b>. Midway he makes love to her; she
advises him to keep off; she is the daughter of a leper. When out
of the wood she laughs, and, the man asking why, says, because
she has come out a maid. He proposes to return, which she will
not hear of; he should have plucked his bird while he had it in
hand. She declares herself daughter of the king, <b>D</b>; of the
seigneur, <b>B</b>; of the chief burgher of the city, <b>A</b>.
The knight of <b>B</b> is an officer in <b>B</b>, who takes the
maid up on his horse, and in <b>B</b> she feigns to be the
hangman's daughter, not a leper's. Inferior copies of the same
type are given by Legrand, Romania, X, 392, No 43, Lovell,
Chansons Canadiennes, p. 30, Gagnon, p. 92 (much corrupted).</p>

<p>In a variation of this story an orange-girl delivers herself
from her predicament by feigning an ague-fit: 'La Marchande
d'Oranges,' Holland, p. 258, No 127, d; Po&eacute;sies pop. de la
France, IV, fol. 166, fol. 213 (a fragment at fol. 286 is the
latter half of the same copy); Bujeaud, I, 249, and 251
(marchande de pommes). Other copies give the story a different
turn.</p>

<p>In another version the man yields to the girl's tears, and is
laughed at in the conclusion: 'Le galant maladroit,'
Po&eacute;sies pop. de la France, Manuscript, Ill, fol. 139, fol.
141; 'La fille bien avis&eacute;e,' fol. 524; IV, fol. 350, 'Il

Faux Saulniers, &OElig;uvres compl&egrave;tes, 1868, IV, 398;

'L'Occasion manqu&eacute;e,' I, 23, No 4 b; Puymaigre, 'La
Rencontre,' p. 113, 2d ed. I, 154. The "moral" is wanting in very
few of these.</p>

<p>Still other varieties, with omissions, additions, or changes
which need not be particularized, are: 'L'Amant discret,'
Puymaigre, p. 112, I, 153; Guillon, pp. 29, 273; ' L'autre jour,'
Blad&eacute;, P. p. de l'Armagnac, p. 114; 'Praube Moussu,'

Blad&eacute;, II, 114; Bujeaud, I, 254; 'Lou Pastour et la
Pastouro,' Daymard, Collection de vieilles chansons recueillies a
Serignac, p. 16, which last I have not seen.</p>

<p><b>Italian</b>. 'La figlia del re,' Ferraro, Canti p.
monferrini, p. 76, No 55. A damsel lost in a wood asks a cavalier
to show her the way. He takes her on his horse. She, for a reason
not given, but to be gathered from the other southern ballads,
tells him that she is daughter of a poor man who has had seven
years of sickness. Get down from the horse, he says, and I will
show you the way. At the end of the wood she tells him she is
daughter of a rich merchant, proprietor of many farms. He
solicits her to mount again. No; he has had the quail and let it
fly; yonder is the castle of her father the king.</p>

<p><b>Danish</b>. 'I Rosenslund,' Grundtvig, IV, 357, No 230,
four copies: <b>A</b>, previously in Levninger, II, 51, No 9,
<b>C</b>, "Tragica, No 14," 1657, Danske Viser, III, 94, No 122.
<b>D</b> has a false conclusion. In <b>A</b>, the best copy, from
Manuscripts of the seventeenth century, a knight who is hawking
and hunting finds a damsel in a wood. She has been there all
night, she says, listening to the birds. He says, Not so, it is a
tryst with a knight; and she owns that this is the case. He
proposes that she shall throw over this lover and accept him. She
will not give her faith to two, and asks him for his honor's sake
to convey her to her bower. She rides, he walks; and when they
come to the bower she locks him out, wishing him ill night and
laughing as he rides away.</p>

<p>'Den dyre Kaabe,' Grundtvig, IV, 362, No 231, two copies, from
Manuscripts of the seventeenth century. A maid and a young man
meet in a wood or mead. She invites him to spread both of their
cloaks on the ground for a bed. His new scarlet cloak cost him
fifteen mark in Stockholm, and he will not spoil it by laying it
in the dew. If he will wait, she will go home to her mother's,
not far, and bring a bolster. She goes off laughing and leaves
him expecting her all that day and the next, but she does not
come back. Eight weeks after he meets her at the church door and
asks an explanation. He may thank his cloak of scarlet new for
his disappointment; had she been a young man and met a maid, she
would not have spared her cloak though it were cloth of gold. The
reference to Stockholm points to a Swedish origin for this
ballad, but it is not, says Grundtvig, extant in Swedish.</p>

<p><b>German</b>. 'Das Mantelein,' "Frankfurter Liederbuch 1584,
No 150," Uhland, p. 245, No 106, Mittler, No 32. A young man and
maid go out into the green three hours before day. After
rebuffing him, she strangely asks him, as if she knew that he
would not consent, to spread his cloak on the grass. His cloak
cost him fifty pound, and would be spoiled. In the evening, as
she stands in her tower, the young man passes and greets her. She
answers, The angels above will requite your cloak for my coming
off a maid.</p>

<p>The artifice by which the lady disembarrasses herself in the
Third Part of the broadside ballad, by pulling off the knight's
boots half-way, is a very familiar story, found also in a modern
German ballad, Walter, p. 94, No 64. See Les cent nouvelles
Nouvelles, 1432 and earlier, No 24, ed. Wright, Paris, 1858, I,
128; Hondorff, Promptuarium Exemplorum, "1572, fol. 310," 1586,
362 b; Kirchhof, Wendunmuth, 1562, ed. Oesterley, III, 228, and
other places, besides these, cited by Oesterley, IV, 101.</p>

<p>A modern French ballad, attributed to Favart, which may very
probably have had a basis in popular tradition, celebrates the
<i>fille d'honneur</i> who escapes from the importunity of her
seigneur by distracting his attention (as the lady does in the
second adventure in English <b>C</b>), and leaping on to the
horse from which he had dismounted to make love to her, in some
versions taking his valise with her: 'La villageoise
avis&eacute;e,' from Recueil de romances historiques, tendres et
burlesques, tant anciennes et modernes, par M. D. L**, 1767, I,
299, in Hoffmann und Richter, Schlesische Volkslieder, p. 354;
'La Berg&egrave;re rus&eacute;e,' Puymaigre, pp. 119, 121, or I,
160, 162; Po&eacute;sies pop. de la France, Manuscript, Ill, fol.
37, 284, 294, 522, VI, 472; Wolff, Altfranz&ouml;sische
Volkslieder, p. 142; Tarb&eacute;, 'La Fille d'Honneur,' II, 147;
' Le Cavalier,' Guillon, p. 175. On this French ballad is founded
'Junkernlust und M&auml;dchenlist,' Hoffmann u. Richter, p. 156,
No 132, 'Der Junker und das M&auml;dchen,' Erk u. Irmer, iv, 66,
No 60, 'Die Verschmitzte,' Zuccalmaglio, p. 195, No 93. Some what
similar are 'List der Bedrukte,' Willems, Oude vlaemsche
Liederen, p. 215, No 88; 'The Scotchman Outwitted,' Old Ballads,
1723, I, 211, and Ritson's Select Collection of English Songs,
1783, II, 286; 'The Courtier and Country Maid,' Pills to Purge
Melancholy, I, 128, ed. 1719.</p>

<p>In a Romaic ballad a maid makes a youngster who solicits her carry her over a river, 
then holds him off by promises while they 
cross field and meadow, and when they reach 
a liamlet sets the dogs at him: 
'&#7977;
&#8122;&#960;&#8049;&#964;&#951;,'

<p>There is a French ballad in which a maid who is rowing a man
over a piece of water receives amorous proposals from him, exacts
a large sum of money, lands the gallant, and pushes off: 'La
