<p>The 'Gay Goshawk' first appeared in print in the second volume
of Scott's Minstrelsy, in 1802. Scott's copy was formed partly
from Mrs. Brown's version, <b>A</b>, "and partly from a
Manuscript of some antiquity penes Edit.'" This compounded copy
is now given, <b>B</b>, with those portions which are contained
in the Brown Manuscript printed in smaller type, in order that
what is peculiar to the other manuscript may be distinguished. A
second copy of <b>A</b> was made for William Tytler under the
direction of the reciter in 1783, but has not been recovered.
There were 28 stanzas, as in <b>A</b>, and the first stanza has
been given by Anderson in Nichols's Illustrations, VII, 176.
<b>C</b> was furnished Motherwell by Buchan from a manuscript
sent him, and Buchan says that he himself took down from
recitation the vilely dilated and debased <b>G</b>: Ballads of
the North of Scotland, II, 340.</p>

<p>A ballad widely known in France has the central idea of the
Gay Goshawk, a maid's feigning death to escape from a father to a
lover whom she is not permitted to marry, but in the development
of the story there is no likeness. A version of this ballad,
'Belle Isambourg,' was printed as early as 1607 in a collection
with the title Airs de Cour, p. 40, and was republished by
Rathery in the Moniteur of August 26, 1853, p. 946, after wards
in Haupt's Franzb'sische Volkslieder, p. 92. The king wishes to
give Fair Isambourg a husband, but her heart is fixed on a
handsome knight, whom she loves more than all her kin together,
though he is poor. The king shuts her up in a dark tower,
thinking that this treatment will bring about a change, but it
does not. Isambourg sees her lover riding towards or by the tower
at full speed. She calls to him to stop, and says:</p>

<p>Malade et morte m'y feray,<br/>
Porter en terre m'y lairray,<br/>
Pourtant morte je ne seray.</p>

<p>Puis apres je vous prie amy,<br/>
Qu'a ma chapelle h Sainct-Denis<br/>
Ne m'y laissez pas enfouir.</p>

<p>Isambourg is now proclaimed to be dead, and is carried to
burial by three princes and a knight. Her lover, hearing the
knelling and chanting, puts himself in the way and bids the
bearers stop. Since she has died for loving him too well, he
wishes to say a De profundis. He rips open a little of the
shroud, and she darts a loving smile at him. Everybody is
astonished.</p>

<p>Other versions, derived from oral tradition, have a more
popular stamp: (1.) Po&eacute;sies populaires de la France,
Manuscript, Ill, 54, 'La fille du roi et le Prince de Guise,'
learned at Maubeuge, about 1760. (2.) Ill, 47, 'Le beau
D&eacute;on,' Auvergne. (3.) Ill, 49, 'La princesse de la Grand'
Tour,' Berry. (4.) Ill, 50 (the hero being L&eacute;on), Berry.
(5.) Ill, 53, Caudebec. (6.) Ill, 56, Pamiers, Languedoc. (7.)
Ill, 57, and II, 52, Organs. (8.) 'La fille d'un prince,' Buchon,
No&euml;ls et chants p. de la Franche-Comte, p. 82, No 16. (9.)
'La fille d'un prince,' Rondes et Chansons p. illustr&eacute;es,
Paris, 1876, p. 286. (10.) 'La princesse,' Guillon, Chansons p.
de l'Ain, p. 87. (11.) ' La ma&icirc;tresse captive,' Puymaigre,
Chants p. messins, I, 87. (12.) Le H&eacute;richer,
Litt&eacute;rature p. de Normandie, p. 153 f. (13.) 'De Dion et
de la fille du roi,' Ampere, Instructions, p. 38, the first
fourteen stanzas; Auvergne. (14.) G. de Nerval, La Boh&egrave;me
Galante, ed. 1866, p. 70, and Les Faux Saulniers, ed. 1868, p.
346, the story completed in Les Filles du Feu, ed. 1868, p. 132;
or, in the collection lately made from his works, Chansons et
Ballades p. du Valois, p. 16, VIII. The last two have a false
termination, as already remarked under No 4, I, 42.</p>

<p>In these traditional versions, the father pays a visit to the
princess after she has been confined seven years, and asks how
she is. One side is eaten away by worms, her feet are rotting in
the irons. She begs a few sous to give the jailer to loosen her
fetters. Millions are at her disposal if she will give up her
lover. Rather rot, is her reply. Rot, then, says her father. The
lover comes by* and throws a few words of writing into the tower,
directing her to counterfeit death. The rest is much the same. In
several versions the king yields.</p>

<p>There are many other ballads in which a girl, for one reason
or another, feigns death. In 'Les trois capitaines,' or 'La jolie
fille de la Garde,' etc., Arbaud, I, 143, Decombe, Ch. p.
d'Ille-et-Vilaine, p. 150, No 51, Champfleury, Ch. p. des
Provinces, p. 95, Bujeaud, II, 174, 'La Boheme Galante,' ed.
1866, p. 71 f, Chansons du Valois, p. 19, IX, Puy maigre, Vieux
Auteurs, II, 478, E. Legrand, Romania, X, 369, No 6, the object
is to save her honor;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d096_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> so in Marcoaldi, p. 162, No 10,
Ferraro, C. p. monferrini, p. 41, No 31. The well-disposed
hostess of an inn administers a sleeping-draught, in Arbaud's
ballad and in Decombe's. The object is to avoid becoming a king's
mistress, in 'Kvindelist,' Grundtvig, IV, 394, No 235, 'Hertig
Hillebrand och hans Syster,' Arwidsson, I, 380 No 61; in a
Bohemian ballad, to avoid marrying a Turk, 'Oklamany Turek,' 'The
Turk duped,' Celakovsky, III, 11 (translated in Bowring's
Cheskian Anthology, p. 129) Erben, p. 485, etc., etc.; to move a
lover who is on the point of deserting, Hoffmann,
Niederl&auml;ndische Volkslieder, p. 61, No 15, Willems, No 60,
Uhland, No 97 B.</p>

<p>In '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_25.html">Willie's Lyke-Wake</a>,' No 25, I, 247, a man feigns death in
order to capture a coy maid, or a maid refused him by her
parents.</p>

<p>Birds are not seldom employed as posts in ballads: see 'Sweet
William,' Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 307, Mild, Romancerillo, No
258; Hartung, Romanceiro, I, 193 (dove). A falcon carries a
letter, in Afzelius, III, 116, No 87, and Mil&aacute;, No 258 K,
and Marko Kraljevitch sends a letter by a falcon from his prison,
Karadsbitch, II, 383. For a love-message of a general sort, not
involving business, the nightingale is usually and rightly
selected. On the other hand, a nightingale first orders a ring of
a goldsmith, and afterwards delivers it to a lady, in Uhland, No
15.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d096_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In this ballad the goshawk is endowed with the
nightingale's voice. The substitution of a parrot in <b>G</b>, a
bird that we all know can talk, testifies to the advances made by
reason among the humblest in the later generations,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d096_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A
parrot, says Buchan, "is by far a more likely messenger to carry
a love-letter or deliver a verbal message," II, 341. The parrot
goes well with the heroine swooning on a sofa (stanza 33) and the
step-dame sitting on the sofa's end (stanza 36).</p>

<p>Thieves drop three drops of wax on the breast of a
servant-girl who is feigning sleep, and she shows no sign of
feeling, in a Catalan ballad, Mil&aacute;, Romancerillo, p. 104,
No 114, vv 13-16, Observaciones, p. 147, No 43, Briz, I,
147.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d096_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
