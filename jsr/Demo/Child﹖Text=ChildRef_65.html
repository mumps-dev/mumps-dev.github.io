<p><b>A</b> was No 12 in William Tytler's Brown manuscript, and
stanzas 1, 21, 22, of that copy are cited by Anderson in his
letter to Percy, Nichols's Illustrations, VII, 177. Jamieson, who
made a few changes in printing from his manuscript, attributes,
by an oversight, the ballad to Mrs. Arrot: compare Popular
Ballads, I, pp 66 and 59. His copy is repeated by Motherwell, p.
71. <b>C</b>, of which no account is given by Motherwell, is
hardly more than a variety of <b>B</b>. T =here is a copy in the
Abbotsford manuscript, "Scottish Songs," which is more
considerably tampered with, in the way of change, omission, and
insertion.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d065_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>All the versions are in accord as to the material points of
the story. Lady Maisry rejects the suit of all the lords in the
north country, <b>A</b>; she has given her love to an English
lord. Her lover's seat is Strawberry Castle, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>F</b>; Adam's Tower, <b>H</b>; he lives at London, <b>G</b>.
Maisry has been at Strawberry Castle for a time, and has there
learned some unco lair, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d065_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It is discovered
that Maisry goes with bairn. Her brother, <b>A</b>, <b>H</b>,
father, <b>I</b>, informed to this effect, requires her to
renounce her English lord, but she refuses; her father offers her
the choice of marrying an auld man or burning, <b>D</b>. In the
other versions the family set about preparations for burning her
without attempting any arrangement. Maisry, warned of her
approaching fate, calls for a boy to carry word to England, and a
light-footed and heartily devoted young messenger takes her
errand. The English lord asks if his biggins are broken, his
towers won, or is his lady lighter, and is told that his lady is
to be burnt for him that very day. Horses are instantly saddled:
a black, a brown, are foundered, a milk-white [a dapple-gray],
fair fall the mare that foaled that foal! holds out, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>. In <b>D</b> fifteen stout steeds
are burst, yet the little foot-page runs aye before, crying, Mend
your pace an you may! Maisry, in the flames, hears her lover's
horn, hears his bridle ring, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>H</b>. "Beet on!" she cries; "I value you not one straw. Mend
up the fire, brother; I see him coming that will soon mend it up
to thee."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d065_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In <b>A</b>, <b>H</b> she cries out, when her
lover appears, that if her hands had been free she would have
cast out his young son. He leaps into the fire for a last kiss;
her body falls apart, <b>B</b>-<b>G</b>. He threatens an awful
retaliation: he will burn father and mother, and the chief of all
her kin (who, no doubt, had been concerned in this auto da
f&eacute;). Vengeance glutted, he will throw himself into the
flames, <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>; he will take the pilgrim's cloak and
staff, <b>C</b>. The foot-page shall be heir of his land,
<b>C</b>; he will remember the bonny boy that ran the errand,
<b>E</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d065_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Maisry, Margery, is the heroine's name in <b>A</b>,
<b>D</b>-<b>H</b>, <b>J</b>; Janet in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>; Susie
Cleland in <b>I</b>. The hero has a name only in <b>A</b>, Lord
William, and in <b>H</b>, Prince James.</p>

<p>'Lady Maisry' has a limited, and perhaps quite accidental,
resemblance to the Scandinavian-German ballad spoken of in the
preface to '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_64.html">Fair Janet</a>.' The lapse of the heroine is visited with
a fearful death at the hand of brother or father, and the lover
who was partner to her trespass appears on the scene immediately
after, and takes his revenge. A kitchey-boy is informant in
<b>A</b>, as in some versions of the German story.</p>

<p>The regular penalty for incontinence in an unmarried woman, if
we are to trust the authority of romances, is burning. This,
according to the well-known passage in Ariosto, Orlando Furioso,
IV, 58, 59, was l'aspra legge di Scozia, empia e severa, though
it might be as difficult to point out a law to that effect in any
European code as a corresponding patria potestas.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d065_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Some
