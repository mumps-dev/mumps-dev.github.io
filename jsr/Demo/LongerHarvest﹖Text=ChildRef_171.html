<h3>Thomas Cromwell</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Percy Manuscript, p. 55; Hales and Furnivall, I, 129. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d17101.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>June 10, 1540, Thomas Lord Cromwell, "when he least expected
it," was arrested at the council-table by the Duke of Norfolk for
high-treason, and on the 28th of July following he was executed.
Cromwell, says Lord Herbert of Cherbury, judged "his perdition
more certain that the duke was uncle to the Lady Katherine
Howard, whom the king began now to affect." Later writers<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d171_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
have asserted that Katherine Howard exerted herself to procure
Cromwell's death, and we can understand nobody else but her to be
doing this in the third stanza of this fragment; nevertheless
there is no authority for such a representation. The king had no
personal interview with the minister whom he so suddenly struck
down, but he did send the Duke of Norfolk and two others to visit
Cromwell in prison, for the purpose of extracting confessions
pertaining to Anne of Cleves. Cromwell wrote a letter to the
king, imploring the mercy which, as well as confession, he
refuses in stanza five.</p>

<p>Percy inserted in the Reliques, 1765, II, 58, a song against
Cromwell, printed in 1540, and apparently before his death, and
he observes, 1767, II, 86, that there was a succession of seven
or eight more, for and against, which were then preserved, and of
course are still existing, in the archives of the Antiquarian
Society.</p>
