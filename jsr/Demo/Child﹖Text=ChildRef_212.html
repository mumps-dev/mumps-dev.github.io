<p><b>M</b>, <b>N</b> of No 214 have stanzas belonging here.
<b>M</b> 1, 3 = <b>A</b> 3, 6; <b>N</b> 4, 6, 7 = <b>A</b> 2, 4,
5. <b>A</b> 1<sup>1,2</sup>, 2 nearly, are found in No 213,
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_213.html">Sir James the Rose</a>,' 4<sup>1,2</sup>, 5, where also
there is a
treacherous leman.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. The 'new-come darling' of the Duke of Athole offers
the duke's nurse a ring if she will carry a word to her leman.
This leman had previously been the nurse's lover, and comes to
tell her tbat another has now possession of his heart. The nurse
plans revenge, but dissimulates; she tells the faithless fellow
to go for the night to an ale-house, and she will meet him there
in the morning. But in stead of the nurse he sees a band of men,
her seven brothers (nine brothers, <b>F</b>), coming towards tbe
house, and easily divines that they are come to slay him. He
appeals to the landlady to save him; she dresses him in woman's
clothes and sets him to her baking. The seven brothers ask the
landlady if she had a lodger last night; they are come to pay his
reckoning. A lodger had been there, but he did not stay till
morning. They search the house and stab the beds, often passing
the sham baking-maid without detecting the disguise.</p>

<p><b>C</b>-<b>F</b> have nothing about the 'new-come darling,'
but begin at once with the nurse, who longs for her lover, and
would give her half-year's fee to see him. He appears, and avows
to her that another woman has gained his heart.</p>
