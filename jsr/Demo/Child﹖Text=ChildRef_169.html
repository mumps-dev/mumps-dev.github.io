<p><b>A</b> <b>b</b> is not found in Wit and Drollery, 1661; it
is literally repeated in Dryden's Miscellanies, 1716, III, 307.
<b>B</b> is in the Roxburghe collection, III, 513, the Bagford,
I, 64, II, 94, and no doubt in others. It was printed by Evans,
1777, II, 64, and by Ritson, English Songs, 1783, II, 322.
<b>C</b> was printed by Herd, 1769, p. 260, 1776 (with spelling
changed), I, 13; by Ritson, Scotish Songs, 1794, II, 7; by Scott,
1802, I, 49, 1833, I, 407 (with a slight change or two).</p>

<p>'Ihonne Ermistrangis dance' is mentioned in The Complaynt of
Scotland, 1549, ed. Murray, p. 66. The tune of <b>C</b> is No 356
of Johnson's Museum; see further Stenhouse, in the I edition of
1853, IV, 335 f.</p>

<p>Of his copy <b>C</b>, Ramsay says: "This is the true old
ballad, never printed before... This I copied from a gentleman's
mouth of the name of Armstrang, who is the sixth generation from
this John. He tells me this was ever esteemd the genuine ballad,
the common one false." Motherwell remarks, Minstrelsy, p. lxii,
note 3: "The common ballad alluded to by Ramsay [<b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>] is the one, however, which is in the mouths of the
people. His set I never heard sung or recited; but the other
frequently." A manuscript copy of <b>B</b>, entitled Gillnokie,
communicated to Percy by G. Paton, Edinburgh, December 4, 1778,
which has some of the peculiar readings of <b>B</b> <b>a</b>,
introduces the 27th stanza of <b>C</b><a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in place of 12, and
has 'Away, away, thou traitor strong' for 12<sup>1</sup>. A copy
in Buchan's Manuscripts, I, 61, 'The Death of John Armstrong,'
has the first half of <b>C</b> 18 and also of <b>C</b> 19 (with
very slight variations). Another Scottish copy, which was
evidently taken from recitation, introduces <b>C</b> 23 after
14.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Both forms of the ballad had been too long printed to allow
validity to any known recited copy. Besides the three already
mentioned, there is one in Kinloch's Manuscripts, V, 263, which
intermixes two stanzas from Johnie Scot. The Scottish copies
naturally do not allow 'Scot' to stand in 17<sup>3</sup>. Paton's
substitutes 'chiell'; the others 'man,' and so a broadside
reprinted by Maidment, Scotish Ballads and Songs, Historical and
Traditionary, I, 130.</p>

<p>The Armstrongs were people of consideration in Liddesdale from
the end, or perhaps from the middle, of the fourteenth century,
and by the sixteenth had become the most important sept, as to
numbers, in that region, not only extending themselves over a
large part of the Debateable Land,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> but spreading also into
Eskdale, Ewesdale, Wauchopedale, and Annandale. The Earl of
Northumberland, in 1528, puts the power of the Armstrongs, with
their adherents, above three thousand horsemen. Mangerton, in
Liddesdale, on the east bank of the Liddel, a little north of its
junction with the Kersope, was the seat of the chief. John
Armstrong, known later as Gilnockie, a brother of Thomas, laird
of Mangerton, is first heard of in 1525. Removing from Liddesdale
early in the century, as it is thought, he settled on the church
lands of Canonby, and at a place called The Hollows, on the west
side of the Esk, built a tower, which still remains.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Others of the Armstrongs erected strong houses in the
neighborhood. Lord Dacre, the English warden of the West Marches,
essayed to surprise these strengths in the early part of 1528,
but was foiled by John and Sym Armstrong, though he had a force
of two thousand men. The Armstrongs, if nominally Scots, were so
far from being "in due obeysaunce" that, at a conference of
commissioners of both realms in November of the year last named,
the representatives of the Scottish king could not undertake to
oblige them to make redress for injuries done the English, though
a peace depended upon this condition. Perhaps the English border
suffered more than the Scottish from their forays (and the
English border, we are informed, was not nearly so strong as the
Scottish, neither in "capetayns nor the commynnaltie"), but how
little Scotland was spared appears from what Sym Armstrong, the
laird of Whitlaugh, in the same year again, told the Earl of
Northumberland: that himself and his adherents had laid waste in
the said realm sixty miles, and laid down thirty parish churches,
and that there was not one in the realm of Scotland dare remedy
the same. Indeed, our John, Thomas of Mangerton, Sym of
Whitlaugh, and the rest, seem to be fairly enough described in an
English indictment as " enemies of the king of England, and
traitors, fugitives, and felons of the king of Scots."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Other measures having failed, King James the Fifth, in the
summer of 1530, took the pacifying of his borders into his own
hand, and for this purpose levied an army of from eight to twelve
thousand men. The particulars of this noted expedition are thus
given by Lindsay of Pitscottie.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"The king ... made a convention at Edinburgh with all the
lords and barons, to consult how he might best stanch theiff and
river within his realm, and to cause the commons to live in peace
and rest, which long time had been perturbed before. To this
effect he gave charge to all earls, lords, barons, freeholders
and gentlemen, to compeir at Edinburgh with a month's victual, to
pass with the king to daunton the thieves of Teviotdale and
Annandale, with all other parts of the realm; also the king
desired all gentlemen that had dogs that were good to bring them
with them to hunt in the said bounds, which the most part of the
noblemen of the Highlands did, such as the earls of Huntly,
Argyle, and Athol, who brought their deer-hounds with them and
hunted with his majesty. These lords, with many other lords and
gentlemen, to the number of twelve thousand men, assembled at
Edinburgh, and therefrom went with the king's grace to
Meggat-land, in the which bounds were slain at that time eighteen
score of deer. After this hunting the king hanged John Armstrong,
laird of Kilnokie; which many a Scotsman heavily lamented, for he
was a doubtit man, and as good a chieftain as ever was upon the
borders, either of Scotland or of England. And albeit he was a
loose-living man, and sustained the number of twenty-four
well-horsed able gentlemen with him, yet he never molested no
Scotsman.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> But it is said, from the Scots border to Newcastle
of England, there was not one, of whatsoever estate, but paid to
this John Armstrong a tribute, to be free of his cumber, he was
so doubtit in England. So when he entered in before the king, he
came very reverently, with his foresaid number very richly
appareled, trusting that in respect he had come to the king's
grace willingly and voluntarily, not being taken nor apprehended
by the king, he should obtain the more favor. But when the king
saw him and his men so gorgeous in their apparel, and so many
braw men under a tyrant's commandment, throwardlie he turned
about his face, and bade take that tyrant out of his sight,
saying, What wants yon knave that a king should have? But when
John Armstrong perceived that the king kindled in a fury against
him, and had no hope of his life, notwithstanding of many great
and fair offers which he offered to the king that is, that he
should sustain himself, with forty gentlemen, ever ready to await
upon his majesty's service, and never to take a penny of Scotland
nor Scotsmen; secondly, that there was not a subject in England,
duke, earl, lord, or baron, but within a certain day he should
bring any of them to his majesty, quick or dead he, seeing no
hope of the king's favor towards him, said very proudly, I am but
a fool to seek grace at a graceless face. But had I known, sir,
that ye would have taken my life this day, I should have lived
upon the borders in despite of King Harry and you both; for I
know King Harry would down weigh my best horse with gold to know
that I were condemned to die this day. So he was led to the
scaffold, and he and all his men hanged."</p>

<p>Buchanan's account is, that the king undertook an expedition
for the suppressing of freebooters in July, 1530, with an army of
about eight thousand men, and encamped at Ewes water, near which
was the hold of John Armstrong, a chief of a band of thieves, who
had struck such terror into the parts adjacent that even the
English for many miles about paid him tribute. Under enticement
of the king's officers, John set out to pay a visit to the king
with about fifty horsemen, both unarmed and without a
safe-conduct, and on his way fell in with a body of scouts, who
took him to their master as a pretended prisoner, and he and most
of his men were hanged. The authors of his death averred that
Armstrong had promised the English to put the neighboring Scots
territory under their sway, if they would make it for his
interest; whereas the English were extremely pleased at his
death, because they were rid of a redoubtable enemy.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Bishop Lesley says simply that in the month of June
(apparently 1529) the king passed to the borders with a great
army, where he caused forty-eight of the most noble thieves, with
John Armstrong, their captain, to be taken, who being convict of
theft, reiff, slaughter, and treason, were all hanged upon
growing trees.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Another account gives us positively and definitely to
understand that the Armstrongs were not secured without artifice.
"On the eighth of June the principals of all the surnames of the
clans on the borders came to the king, upon hope of a
proclamation proclaimed in the king's name that they should all
get their lives if they would come in and submit themselves in
the king's will. And so, upon this hope, John Armstrong, who kept
the castle of Langholm (a brother of the laird of Manger ton's, a
great thief and oppressor, and one that kept still with him four
and twenty well-horsed men), came in to the king; and another
called 111 Will Armstrong, another stark thief, with sundry of
the Scotts and Elliotts, came all forward to the camp where the
king was, in hope to get their pardons. But no sooner did the
king perceive them, and that they were come afar off, when
direction was given presently to enclose them round about; the
which was done, accordingly, and were all apprehended, to the
number of thirty-five persons, and at a place called Carlaverock
Chapel were all committed to the gallows... The English people
was exceeding glad when they understood that John Armstrong was
executed, for he did great robberies and stealing in England,
maintaining twenty-four men in household every day upon reiff and
oppression."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The place of execution is mentioned by no other historian than
Anderson, just quoted, and he gives it as Carlaverock Chapel. But
this must be a mistake for Carlenrig Chapel, Carlaverock not
being in the line of the king's progress. James is known to have
been at Carlenrig<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> on the 5th of July, and Johnie Armstrong
not to have been alive on the eighth. It has been popularly
believed that Johnie and his band were buried in Carlenrig
churchyard (where the graves used to be shown), and their
execution made so deep an impression on the people<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> that it is
not unplausible that the fact should be remembered, and that the
ballad C, in saying that John was murdered at Carlenrig, has
followed tradition rather than given rise to it.</p>

<p>It appears from Lindsay's narrative that Johnie Armstrong came
to the king voluntarily, and that he was not "taken or
apprehended." Buchanan says that he was enticed by the king's
officers, and Anderson that the heads of the border-clans were
induced to come in by a proclamation that their lives should be
safe. It is but too likely, therefore, that the capture was not
effected by honorable means, and this is the representation of
the ballads. There is no record of a trial,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and the
execution was probably as summary as the arrest was
perfidious.</p>

<p>The ballads treat facts with the customary freedom and improve
upon them greatly. In <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, English ballads, Johnie
is oddly enough a Westmorland man,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> though in <b>B</b> 11 he
admits himself to be a subject of the Scots king. The king writes
John a long letter promising to do him no wrong, <b>A</b> 4; a
loving letter, to come and speak with him speedily, <b>B</b> 4,
<b>C</b> 2. Johnie goes to Edinburgh with the eight-score men
that he keeps in his hall, all in a splendid uniform, asks grace,
and is told that he and his eight-score shall be hanged the next
morning. They are not unarmed, and resolve to fight it out rather
than be hanged. They kill all the king's guard but three,
<b>B</b> 16, but all Edinburgh rises; four-score and ten of
Johnie's men lie gasping on the ground, <b>A</b> 14. A cowardly
Scot comes behind Johnie and runs him through; like Sir Andrew
Barton, he bids his men fight on; he will bleed awhile, then rise
and fight again. Most of his company are killed, but his
foot-page escapes and carries the bad news to Giltnock Hall. His
little son, by or on the nurse's knee, vows to revenge his
father's death.</p>

<p><b>C</b> differs extensively from <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, indeed
resembles or repeats the English ballad only in a few places:
<b>C</b> 2 = <b>A</b> 4, <b>B</b> 4; <b>C</b> 6 = <b>B</b> 10;
<b>C</b> 7 = <b>A</b> <b>g</b>, <b>B</b> 11; <b>C</b>
22<sup>3,4</sup> = <b>A</b> 11<sup>3,4</sup>, <b>B</b>
13<sup>3,4</sup>. The Eliots go with the Armstrongs according to
<b>C</b> 3, and it is the intention to bring the king to dine at
Gilnockie. In <b>C</b> 9-17 Johnie offers twenty-four steeds,
four of them laden with as much gold as they can carry,
twenty-four mills, and as much wheat as their hoppers can hold,
twenty-four sisters-sons, who will fight to the utterance,
tribute from all the land between 'here' and Newcastle, all this
for his life. The king replies to each successive offer that he
never has granted a traitor's life, and will not begin with him.
Johnie gives the king the lie as to his being a traitor; he could
make England find him in meal and malt for a hundred years, and
no Scot's wife could say that he had ever hurt her the value of a
fly. Had he known how the king would treat him, he would have
kept the border in spite of all his army. England's king would be
a blithe man to hear of his capture. At this point the king is
attracted by Johnie's splendid girdle and hat, and exclaims, What
wants that knave that a king should have! Johnie bids farewell to
his brother, Laird of Mangerton (Thomas, here called Kirsty), and
to his son Kirsty, and to Gilnock-Hall, and is murdered at
Carlenrig with all his band.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the substance, or at least the hint,
of <b>C</b> 21<sup>3,4</sup>, 17<sup>3,4</sup>, 26, 15,
22<sup>3,4</sup>, 23, 24<sup>1,2</sup>, is to be found in
Lindsay's narrative.</p>

<p>In the last stanza of <b>A</b> and of <b>B</b>, Johnie
Armstrong's son (afterwards known as Johnie's Christy) sitting on
his nurse's knee, <b>B</b> (cf. 30), or standing by his nurse's
knee, <b>A</b>, vows, if he lives to be a man, to have revenge
for his father's death.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d169_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Not infrequently, in popular

<p>Johnie's plain speech to the king in <b>C</b> 19, 'Ye lied, ye
lied, now, king!' is such as we have often heard before in these
ballads: see I, 427, No 47, <b>A</b> 14; I, 446, No 50, <b>A</b>
