<h3>The Jolly Beggar</h3>

<h3>Appendix</h3>

<h3>The Gaberlunyie-Man</h3>

<p>Printed in the first volume of Ramsay's Tea-Table Miscellany,
1724, from which it was repeated in Thomson's Orpheus Caledonius,
1725, fol. 43, and Old Ballads, III, 259, the same year; in the
Dublin reprint of the Miscellany, 1729, I, 96, the "fifth
edition," London, 1730, and the ninth edition, London, 1733, I.
84. The first edition, 1724, being of extreme rarity, if anywhere
now to be found, the piece is given here from Old Ballads, which
agrees with Orpheus Caledonius except as to the spelling of a
single word.</p>

<p>The Gaberlunyie-Man is one of the pieces which were subjected
to revision in the Miscellany; "such old verses as have been done
time out of mind, and only wanted to be cleared from the dross of
blundering transcribers and printers, such as 'The
Gaberlunzie-man,' 'Muirland Willy,'" etc. (Ramsay's preface.)</p>

<p>In recited copies, as the "Old Lady's Collection," No 13
(Skene Manuscript, p. 65), and Motherwell's Manuscript, p. 31,
the girl is made to come back again to see her mother (or the
gaberlunyie-man brings her) 'wi a bairn in her arms and ane in
her wame;' but for all that a fine lady, 'wi men- and
maid-servants at her command.'</p>

<p>Translated by Herder, II, 264; Bodmer, I, 68; Fiedler, p. 23;
Lo&egrave;ve-Veimars, p. 356.</p>
