<p>Jamieson, in his preface, 1806, says that this ballad was
current in the Border counties within a few years, and that
<b>A</b> was taken down by Leyden from the recitation of a young
lady who learned it in Teviotdale. Writing to Scott, in November,
1804, of such ballads as he had already prepared for the press,
he says, "Trumpeter of Fyvie, from tradition, furnished by Mr.
Leyden, and collated with a stall-copy" (probably <b>B</b>):
Letters addressed to Sir Walter Scott, Abbotsford, I, No. 117.
Buchan, in the notes to his Gleanings, 1825, p. 197, says of
<b>C</b> <b>a</b>: "This is one of the greatest favorites of the
people in Aberdeenshire that I know. I took it first down from
the memory of a very old woman, and afterwards published thirty
thousand copies of it. There are two versions, an old and a new;
but, although I have both, I prefer this one, the younger of the
two, having been composed and acted in the year 1674." Laing, who
reprints <b>A</b> in his Thistle of Scotland, p. 63, calls that
the "old way of Andrew Lammie." Motherwell, 1827, reprints "a
stall-copy published at Glasgow several years ago, collated with
a recited copy which has furnished one or two verbal
improvements:" <b>C</b> <b>b</b>. There are a great many
variations from <b>C</b> <b>a</b>, of which precisely one or two
are verbal improvements. But Motherwell also gives six stanzas
which are not in <b>a</b>. His copy is repeated in The Ballad
Minstrelsy of Scotland, Glasgow, 1871, and there the editor says
that in a chap-book printed by J. and M. Robertson, Saltmarket,
Glasgow, 1808, "Andrew Lammie is given with only a few slight
verbal differences between it and the copy here printed." Such
stall-copies as I have seen are late, and are reprints of
<b>C</b> <b>a</b> or of <b>C</b> <b>b</b>. Motherwell assures us
that the ballad as he has given it "agrees with any recited copy
which the Editor has hitherto met with in the West Country."</p>

<p>A professed edition, "most carefully collated with all
previous editions," was published at Peterhead, 1872: "Mill o
Tifty's Annie, A Buchan Ballad, with Introduction," etc. This is
attributed to the Rev. Dr. John Muir of Aberdeen. 'Mill o
Tiftie's Annie' in Christie, I, 48 "is epitomized from
traditional copies;" that is to say, it is taken from Motherwell,
with a trifling change here and there. A copy given in Smith's
New History of Aberdeenshire is compounded of <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
and a couple of lines from <b>C</b> <b>b</b>.</p>

<p>Annie, daughter to a well-to-do miller, loses her heart to a
handsome trumpeter in the service of Lord Fyvie. Her father will
not hear of such a match. (Annie has five thousand marks, and the
man not a penny, <b>A</b> 11.) The trumpeter is obliged to go to
Edinburgh for a time, and Annie appoints him a tryst at a,
bridge. He will buy her her wedding-gear while he is away, and
marry her when he comes back. Annie knows that she shall be dead
ere he returns, and bids him an everlasting adieu.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d233_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The
trumpeter goes to the top of the castle and blows a blast which
is heard at his love's house. Her father beats her, her mother
beats her; her brother beats her and breaks her back. Lord Fyvie
is passing on one of these occasions, comes in, and urges Mill of
Tiftie to yield to his daughter's inclinations. The father is
immovable; she must marry higher than with a trumpeter. Annie is
put to bed, with her face towards Fyvie, and dies of a broken
heart and of the cruel treatment which she has undergone.</p>

<p>This is a homely ditty,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d233_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> but the gentleness and fidelity
of Annie under the brutal behavior of her family are genuinely
pathetic, and justify the remarkable popularity which the ballad
has enjoyed in the north of Scotland. In those parts the story
has been played as well as sung. "The ballad used in former times
to be presented in a dramatic shape at rustic meetings in
Aberdeenshire," says Chambers (Scottish Ballads, p. 143); perhaps
misinterpreting and expanding the enunciation made by Buchan and
in the title of some stall-copies that "this tragedy was acted in
the year 1674," which may rather refer to the date of the story.
But however it may have been in former times, two rival companies
in Aberdeenshire were performing plays founded on the ballad in
1887-8.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d233_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"Bonny Andrew Lammie" was a well-known personage at the
beginning of the last century, for, as Jamieson has pointed out,
he is mentioned in a way that implies this by Allan Ramsay, in
the second of his two cantos in continuation of Christ's Kirk on
the Green, written, as Ramsay says, in 1718. (Poems, London,
1731, 1, 76, v. 70.)</p>

<p>Mill of Tiftie is, or was, a farm-house on the side of a glen
about half a mile northeast of the castle of Fyvie, and in view
of its turrets (on one of which there now stands a figure of the
Trumpeter sounding towards Tiftie). The mill proper, now a ruin,
was in the bottom of the glen, and gave its name to the house.
The bridge of Sleugh, otherwise Skeugh, etc., was in the hollow
between Tiftie and the castle.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d233_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Annie was Agnes Smith, Nannie being among her people an
affectionate form for Agnes. There is reason to believe that she
may have been daughter of a William Smith who is known to have
been a brother or near kinsman of the laird of Inveramsay, a
person of some local consequence.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d233_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> An inscription on her
gravestone makes Agnes Smith to have died January 19,
1673.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d233_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"Some years subsequent to the melancholy fate of poor Tifty's
Nanny," says Jamieson, II, 387, citing the current tradition of
Fyvie, "her sad story being mentioned and the ballad sung in a
company in Edinburgh when [Andrew Lammie] was present, he
remained silent and motionless, till he was discovered by a groan
suddenly bursting from him and <i>several of the buttons flying
from his waistcoat</i>" The peasants of Fyvie, Jamieson
continues, "borrowed this striking characteristic of excessive
grief" neither from the Laocoon group nor from Shakspere's King
Lear, but from nature. The anecdote, and the comment too, is apt
to be repeated by editors of 'Andrew Lammie.' That "affecting
image of overpowering grief," as Chambers calls it, the flying
off of the buttons (or the bursting of a waistcoat), we have had
several times already, though in no ballad (or version) of much
note: see II, 118, <b>D</b> 17, 186, <b>C</b> 15, 308, 4; IV,
101, I 15, 185, 11. It must be owned to be a stroke that does not
well bear iteration. Mrs. Littlewit in 'Bartholomew Fair' has a
tedious life with her Puritan, she says: "he breaks his buttons
and cracks seams at every saying he sobs out." Ben Jonson has
taken out one of the best things in our tragedy and put it into
his comedy.</p>

<p>The air to which this ballad was usually, sung, Jamieson
informs us, was "of that class which in Teviotdale they term a
northern drawl; and a Perthshire set of it, but two notes lower
than it is commonly sung, is to be found in Johnson's Scots
Musical Museum [No. 175, p. 183], to the song 'How long and
dreary is the night.'"</p>
