<ol type="A">
<li>Herd's Manuscripts, I, 140; Herd's Ancient and Modern 
Scottish Songs, 1776, II, 172. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d27401.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
<li>'The Merry Cuckold and Kind Wife,' a broadside:
Printed and Sold at the Printing-Office in
Bow Church-Yard, London. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d27402.html"><i>Version B</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>The copy in Ritson's Scotish Song, I, 231, is from Herd, 1776;
that in the Musical Museum, No 454, p. 466, is the same, with
change of a few words. In Smith's Scotish Minstrel, IV, 66, the
piece is turned into a Jacobite ballad. The good wife says she is
hiding her cousin Mclntosh; 'Tories,' says the goodman.</p>

<p><b>B</b> was reprinted by Dixon in Ancient Poems, Ballads, and
Songs of the Peasantry of England, p. 211, Percy Society, vol.
xvii, 'Old Wichet and his Wife,' from a copy "obtained in
Yorkshire" and "collated" with the Aldermary broadside. The fifth
adventure (in the closet) is lacking. Two or three staves, with
variations for the better, are given from memory in Notes and
Queries, First Series, VI, 118, as communicated by Mr. R.O.
Warde, of Kidderminster. (See the notes.)</p>

<p>Percy made <b>B</b> over in two shapes, whether for simple
amusement or for the projected extension of the Reliques: 'Old
Wichet's Discoveries,' 'Old Wichard's Mistakes,' among Percy's
papers.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Our goodman, coming home, sees successively a
saddle-horse, pair of jack-boots, sword, powdered wig, muckle
coat, finally a man, where none such should be. He asks the
goodwife how this came about without his leave. She responds
contemptuously that the things he has supposed himself to see
are, respectively, a sow (milch-cow), a pair of water-stoups, a
porridge-spurtle, a clocken-hen, a pair of blankets, a
milking-maid, which her mother has sent her. Far has he ridden,
but a saddle on a sow's (cow's) back, siller spurs on
water-stoups, etc., long-bearded maidens, has he never seen.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. In <b>B</b> Old Wichet comes upon three horses,
swords, cloaks, pairs of boots, pairs of breeches, hats, and in
the end three men in bed. Blind cuckold, says the wife, they are
three milking-cows, roasting-spits, mantuas, pudding-bags,
petticoats, skimming-dishes, milking-maids, all presents from her
mother. The like was never known, exclaims Old Wichet; cows with
bridles and saddles, roasting-spits with scabbards, etc.,
milking-maids with beards!</p>

<p>A song founded on this ballad was introduced into the play of
"Auld Robin Gray," produced, according to Guest's History of the
Stage, at the Haymarket, July 29, 1794. This song is a neat
r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the ballad, with a satisfactory
catastrophe.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d274_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> See an appendix.</p>

<p>A Gaelic copy, taken down by Rev. Alexander Stewart, of
Ballachulish, from the recitation of an old man in his parish
whose father had been in the way of singing it sixty years
before, is plainly based upon <b>A</b>. The goodman, coming home
unexpectedly, finds a boat on the beach, a horse at the door,
etc. These and other things are explained by his wife as gifts
from her mother. Far has he wandered, but never saw a saddle on a
cow, etc. Alexander Stewart, 'Twixt Ben Nevis and Glencoe, 1885,
p. 76 ff.</p>

<p>A ballad known and sung throughout Flemish Belgium, 'Mijn man
komt thuis,' is formed upon the pattern of <b>A</b>, and must
have been derived from <b>A</b>, unless the two have a common
source. Two copies are given in Volkskunde (Tijdschrift voor
Nederlandsche Folklore), II, 49-58, by the editors, Messrs A.
Gitt&eacute;e and Pol de Mont, a third by Pol de Mont, V, 20. A
man comes home late, and sees in his bedroom a strange hat,
overcoat, and other articles of clothing, and asks whose they
are. His wife answers that they are a water-pot, a straw
mattress, etc., which her mother has sent her. Travel the world
round, he has never seen a water-pot with a band about it, a
straw mattress with two sleeves, etc. In the last adventure of
the first copy, the husband finds a man in the room, and his wife
flatly answers, it is a lover my mother has sent me. The second
copy ends a little better, but not well. The man is explained to
be a foster-child sent by his wife's mother, and so in the third.
The husband has travelled the world round, but a foster-child
with whiskers has he never seen. The wife packs out of the house.
He has travelled the world round, but a wife like his he wishes
never to see again.</p>

<p>Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer, in 1789, turned <b>B</b> into German
in very happy style, furnishing a <i>deno&ucirc;ment</i> in which
the man gives his wife a beating and explains his cuffs as
caresses which her mother has sent her. Meyer's ballad was
printed in 1790, in the G&ouml;ttingen Musenalmanach, p. 61 ff.,
and the same year in Lieder f&uuml;r fr&ouml;hliche
Gesellschaften, p. 37 (Hamburg). It had great and immediate
success, was circulated as a broadside, and was taken up by the
people, in whose mouth it underwent the usual treatment of
ballads traditionally propagated.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d274_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> From Germany it spread
into Scandinavia and Hungary, and perhaps elsewhere. German
varieties are: 'Des Mannes Heimkehr,' Hoffmann u. Richter, p.
225, No 195; 'Wind &uuml;ber Wind,' Simrock, p. 375, No 241; 'Des
Ehemannes Heimkehr,' Ditfurth, Fr&auml;nkische Volkslieder,

V&ouml;lkerstimmen, III, 66; 'Der Bauer u. sein Weib,' Erlach,

97; 'O Wind, O Wind, O Wind!' Zurm&uuml;hlen (D&uuml;lkener
Fiedler), p. 101. (The last four lack the beating.)</p>

<p>The only Scandinavian, copy that I have seen is the Swedish
'Husarerna,' in Bergstr&ouml;m och Nordlander, Sagor, S&auml;gner
och Visor, 1885, p. 93. For indication of others, Danish,
Norwegian, and Swedish (including a broadside as early as 1799),
see, particularly, Olrik, Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, V, II, 211
f., and note***; also, Dybeck's Runa, 1<sup>a</sup> Samlingen,

"Le P&eacute;lerinage de Mireille, p. 173." (The last two I have
not seen.)</p>

<p>For the most part, the colloquy runs in this wise: 'Where were
you last evening, Marion?' 'In the garden, picking a salad.' 'Who
was it you were talking with?' 'A gossip of mine' (camarade,
voisine, cousine, s&oelig;ur, servante, etc.). 'Do women wear a
sword?' 'It was no sword, but a distaff.' 'Do women wear
breeches?' 'She was kilted up.' 'Have women a moustache?' 'She
had been eating mulberries.' 'It is too late for mulberries.'
'They were last year's' (an autumn branch, etc.). 'I will cut off
your head.' 'And what will you do with the rest?' 'Throw it out
of the window.' 'Les corbeaux (cochons, chiens, chats, mouches,
couteliers, capucins, anges, etc.) en feront f&ecirc;te.' In a
few instances, to end the more smartly, the husband is made to
promise (or the wife to ask) forgiveness for this time, and the
wife adds, aside, 'and many more.' 'You will play off no more
tricks on me.' 'Forgive this, and I will, a good many.'
(Rolland.) 'Pardon this fault; to-morrow I will commit another.'
(Victor Smith.) 'Get up: I pardon you.' 'What dolts men are! What
can't we make them believe!' (Manuscripts, III, 78.) Etc.</p>

<p>In some half dozen copies, Marion has been at the spring (not
in the garden), and has stayed suspiciously long, which she
accounts for by her having found the water muddied. After this,
and in a few copies which have no garden or spring, the matter is
much the same as in the English ballad; there is a sword on the
mantel-shelf (a gun on the table), boots (cane) behind the door,
a man where nae man should be. Nearest of all to the English is
one of Victor Smith's ballads, Romania, IX, 566: 'Whose horse was
that in the stable last night?' 'No horse, but our black cow.' 'A
cow with a saddle?' 'No saddle; it was the shadow of her horns.'
'Whose breeches, boots, sabre, hat?' 'qui &eacute;tait
couch&eacute; &agrave; ma place?' The mulberries are nearly a
constant feature in the French ballad.</p>

<p>There is an approach to a serious termination in Manuscripts,
III, 87: 'Say your prayers, without so much noise.' 'At least put
my bones in the ground.' And in Puymaigre: 'I will take you to
Flanders and have you hanged.' 'Leave the gallows for the great
robbers of France.' The copies, Manuscripts, III, 62, 71, end,
prosaically, 'Jamais je n'ai vu ni fille ni femme qui sent la
putain comme toi;' 'Femme qui m'a tromp&eacute; la mort a
m&eacute;rit&eacute;e!'</p>

<p>The lace-makers of Vorey are wont to recite or sing this
ballad winter evenings as a little drama: V. Smith, Romania, IX,
568, note. So the young girls in Lorraine during carnival,
Puymaigre, I, 263; and the young fellows in Provence, Arbaud, II,
155 f.</p>

<p><b>Italian</b>. 'Le repliche di Marion,' Nigra, Canti popolari
del Piemonte, p. 422, No 85, A, B, C. The Piedmontese copies
follow the French closely, beginning with picking salad in the
garden, and ending with 'your peace is made,' as in
Po&eacute;sies p. de la France, Manuscripts, III, 64. 'Il marito
geloso' (incomplete), Ferraro, Canti p. moriferrini, p. 93, No
70. 'La sposa colta in fallo,' Bernoni, Canti p. veneziani,
puntata ix, No 8, p. 12. (Mari&ugrave; goes on her knees and asks
pardon, and is told to get up, for pardoned she is.) 'Bombarion,'
Ferrari, first in Giornale di Filologia romanza, III, No 7, p.
74, 1880, and then in Archivio per le Tradizioni popolari, Canti
p. in San Pietro Capofiume, VII, 398, 1888 (peace is made). All
the Italian versions keep near to the French, having nothing
original but an unimportant insertion, 'Chi ti fara la minestra?'
etc., just before the end.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d274_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>Catalan</b>. 'La Trapassera,' Briz y Salt&oacute;, Cants
pop. Catalans, II, 69. Father hears daughter talking with lover
in the garden; the usual questions and replies; improved, or
corrupted, at the end.</p>

<p>For serious ballads, Scandinavian, Spanish, etc., exhibiting
similar questions and evasions, see 'Clerk Saunders,' No 69 P,
and the remarks at II, 157 f., 512 a, III, 509 a, IV, 468 a. The
romance 'De Blanca-Ni&ntilde;a' occurs in the Cancionero de
Romances of 1550. The oldest Scandinavian ballad of the class is
one of Syv's, printed in 1695.</p>
