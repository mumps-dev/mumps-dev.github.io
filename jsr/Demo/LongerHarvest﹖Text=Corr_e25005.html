<h3>250. Henry Martyn</h3>


<p>P. 393. 'Andrew Bartin,' communicated by Miss Louise Porter
Haskell as derived from Gen. E.P. Alexander of South Carolina,
and derived by him from the singing of a cadet at West Point
Military Academy in the winter of 1856-7. Two or three slight
corrections have been made by Mrs. A.C. Haskell, sister of Gen.
Alexander. This copy comes nearer than the others to the original
Andrew Barton; but sts 11-13 are derived from Captain Ward, No
287, 8, 10.</p>

<p>Fragment of a Suffolk Harvest Home song, remembered by an old
Suffolk divine. Contributed by Edward Fitzgerald to Suffolk Notes
and Queries in the 'Ipswich Journal,' 1877-78; where another
stanza follows which has no connection with the above. See 'Two
Suffolk Friends,' by Francis Hindes Groome, Edinburgh and London,
1895, p. 79 f.</p>
