<h3>Young Bearwell</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'Young Bearwell,' Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland,
II, 75;" Motherwell's Manuscript, p. 456, derived from Buchan;
Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. 345. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d30201.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>This is one of half a dozen pieces sent Buchan by Mr. Nicol of
Strichen, "who wrote them from, memory as he had learned them in
his earlier years from old people." It is also one of not a few
flimsy and un jointed ballads found in Buchan's volumes, the like
of which is hardly to be found elsewhere, that require a
respectable voucher, such as Mr. Nicol undoubtedly was, for the
other five pieces communicated by him were all above suspicion,
and have a considerable value. It will not, however, help the
ballad much that it was not palmed off on Buchan in jest or
otherwise, or even if it was learned from an old person by Mr.
Nicol in his youth. The intrinsic character of the ballad
remains, and old people have sometimes burdened their memory with
worthless things.</p>

<p>Young Bearwell and a mayor's daughter are lovers. Seeing him
coming along one day, the lady tells him that there are such
reports in circulation about him that he will have to sail the
sea beyond Yorkisfauld, which may be beyond Ultima Thule for
aught we know. Bear well's life is in danger where he is, and the
lady has had the forethought to build him a ship, in which she
sends him off. By the process of sailing both east and west and
then meeting wind from the north, he is blown to a land where the
king and court, who pass their time mostly in playing ball, put a
harp into the hand of every stranger and invite him to stay and
play. Bearwell stays, and perhaps plays, twelve months. During
this time the lady is so beset with suitors that she feels
constrained to apply to a young skipper named Heyvalin to fetch
her true-love back. To do this he must sail first east, then
west, and then have a blast of north wind to blow him to the
land. All this comes to pass; the king and court are playing
ball, but immediately put a harp into Heyvalin's hand and urge
him to stay and play. Skipper though he be, he falls to playing,
and finds Bearwell the first man in all the company.</p>

<p>"From circumstances," which do not occur to me, Motherwell
would almost be inclined to trace this piece to a Danish source,
"or it may be an episode of some forgotten metrical romance." It
may also, and more probably, be the effort of some amateur
ballad-monger in northern Scotland whose imagination was unequal
to the finishing of the inane story which he had undertaken.</p>
