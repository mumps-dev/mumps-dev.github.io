<p>P. 7. Of the custom of a maid's making a shirt for her
betrothed, see L. Pineau in Revue des Traditions Populaires, XI,
68. A man's asking a maid to sew him a shirt is equivalent to
asking for her love, and her consent to sew the shirt to an
acceptance of the suitor. See, for examples, Grundtvig, III, 918.
When the Elf in 'Elveskud,' <b>D</b> 9, Grundtvig, II, 116,
offers to give Ole a shirt of silk, it is meant as a love-token;
Ole replies that his true love had already given him one. The
shirt demanded by the Elfin Knight may be fairly understood to
have this significance, as Grundtvig has suggested. So, possibly,
in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_42.html">Clerk Colvill</a>,' No 42, <b>A</b> 5, I, 387, considering the
relation of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_42.html">Clerk Colvill</a>' and 'Elveskud.' We have silken sarks
sewn by a lady's hand in several other ballads which pass as
simple credentials; as in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_99.html">Johnie Scot</a>,' No 99, <b>A</b> 12, 13,
<b>D</b> 6, <b>E</b> 2, <b>H</b> 4, 5, II, 379, 385, 389; etc.
Here they may have been given originally in troth-plight: but not
in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_83.html">Child Maurice</a>,' No 83, <b>D</b> 7, <b>F</b> 9, II, 269,
