<h3>The Laidley Worm of Spindleston Heughs.</h3>

<p>A View of Northumberland, by W. Hutchinson, Anno 1776,
Newcastle, 1778, II, 162-64. Communicated by the Rev. Mr. Lamb,
of Norham.</p>

<p>Kinloch's account of the tradition in relation to the queen,
as it maintains itself in Berwickshire, is quite in accord with
German <i>sagen</i> about enchanted ladies, innocent or guilty,
and as such may be worth giving: Kinloch Manuscripts, I, 187.</p>

<p>"Though the ballad mentions that the queen was transformed
into 'a spiteful toad of monstrous size,' and was doomed in that
form to wend on the earth until the end of the world, yet the
tradition of the country gives another account of the endurance
of her enchantment. It is said that in form of a toad as big as a
'clockin hen' she is doomed to expiate her guilt by confinement
in a cavern in Bamborough castle, in which she is to remain in
her enchanted shape until some one shall have the hardihood to
break the spell by penetrating the cavern, whose 'invisible' door
only opens every seven years, on Christmas eve. The adventurer,
after entering the cavern, must take the sword and horn of the
Childe of Wane, which hang on the wall, and having unsheathed and
resheathed the sword thrice, and wound three blasts on the horn,
he must kiss the toad three times; upon which the enchantment
will be dissolved, and the queen will recover her human form.</p>

<p>"Many adventurers, it is said, have attempted to disenchant
the queen, but have all failed, having immediately fallen into a
trance, something similar to the princes in the Arabian tale who
went in search of the Talking Bird, Singing Tree, and Yellow
Water. The last one, it is said, who made the attempt was a
countryman, about sixty years ago, who, having watched on
Christmas eve the opening of the door, entered the cavern, took
the sword and horn from the wall, unsheathed and resheathed the
sword thrice, blew three blasts on the horn, and was proceeding
to the final disenchantment by kissing the toad, which he had
saluted twice, when, perceiving the various strange sleepers to
arise from the floor, his courage failed, and he fled from the
cavern, having just attained the outside of the door when it
suddenly shut with a loud clap, catching hold of the skirt of his
coat, which was torn off and left in the door.</p>

<p>And none since that time<br/>
To enter the cavern presume."</p>
