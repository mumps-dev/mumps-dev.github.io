<h3>17. Hind Horn</h3>

<p>P. 187. <b>F</b>. Insert the title 'Young Hyndhorn.'</p>

<p><b>G</b>. Insert: Kinloch Manuscripts, VII, 117.</p>

<p>192. Dr. Davidson informs me that many years ago he heard a
version of 'Hind Horn,' in four-line stanzas, in which, as in
'Horn et Rymenhild' and 'Horn Childe and Maiden Rimnild,' Horn
took part in a joust at the king's court,</p>

<p>193 b (2). Add: 'Herr Lovmand,' Kristensen, I, 136, No 52.</p>

<p>194. A corrupt fragment of a ballad, 'Der Bettler,' in
Schr&ouml;er's Ausflug nach Gottschee, p. 210 f (K&ouml;hler),
retains features like 'Hind Horn.' The beggar comes to a wedding,
and sits by the stove. The bride kindly says, Nobody is thinking
of the beggar, and hands him a glass of wine. He says, Thanks,
fair bride; thou wast my first wife. Upon this the
<i>bridegroom</i> jumps over the table, crying, Bachelor I came,
and bachelor will go.</p>

<p>The Epirots and Albanians have a custom of betrothing or
marrying, commonly in early youth, and of then parting for a long
period. A woman was lately (1875) buried at Iannina who, as the
archbishop boasted in the funeral discourse, had preserved her
fidelity to a husband who had been separated from her thirty
years. This unhappy usage has given rise to a distinct class of
songs. Dozon, Chansons populaires bulgares, p. 294, note.</p>

<p>195 b (5). The German popular rhymed tale of Henry the Lion is
now known to have been composed by the painter Heinrich
G&ouml;tting, Dresden, 1585. Germania, XXVI, 453, No 527.</p>

<p>198 a, to first paragraph. For the marvellous transportation
in these stories, see a note by Liebrecht in Jahrb&uuml;cher
f&uuml;r rom. u. eng. Literatur, III, 147. In the same, IV, 110,
Liebrecht refers to the legend of Hugh of Halton, recounted by
Dugdale in his Antiquities of Warwickshire, II, 646, ed. of 1730,
and Monasticon Anglicanum, IV, 90 f, ed. 1823 (and perhaps in
Dugdale's Baronage of England, but I have not found it there).
Hugo is another Gerard: the two half-rings miraculously unite.
(K&ouml;hler.) See, also, Landau on Torello, 'Der Wunderritt,'
Quellen des Dekameron 1884, pp 193-218.</p>

<p>198 b, third paragraph. Other versions of 'Le Retour du Mari:'
Fleury, Litt&eacute;rature Orale de la Basse-Normandie, p. 268;
E. Legrand, Romania, X, 374, also from Normandy.</p>

<p>A ballad of the nature of 'Le Retour du Mari' is very popular
in Poland: Kolberg, No 22, pp 224 ff, some dozen copies;
Wojcicki, I, 287; Wojcicki, II, 311 = Kolberg's <b>c</b>;
Lipinski, p. 159 = Kolberg's <b>i</b>; Konopka, p. 121, No 20;
Koz&#322;owski, No 5, p. 35, p. 36, two copies. In Moravian,
'Prvni milej&#353;&iacute;,' 'The First Love,' Su&#353;il, No
135, p. 131. The general course of the story is that a young man
has to go to the war the day of his wedding or the day after. He
commits his bride to her mother, saying, Keep her for me seven
years; and if I do not then come back, give her to whom you
please. He is gone seven years, and, returning then, asks for his
wife. She has just been given to another. He asks for a fiddle
[pipe], and says he will go to the wedding. They advise him to
stay away, for there will be a disturbance. No, he will only
stand at the door and play. The bride jumps over fonr tables, and
makes a courtesy to him on a fifth, welcomes him and dismisses
the new bridegroom.</p>

<p>199 a, end of the first paragraph. I forgot to mention the
version of Costantino, agreeing closely with Camarda's, in De
Rada, Rapsodie d'un poema albanese raccolte nelle colonie del
Napoletano, pp 61-64.</p>

<p>200. A maid, parting from her lover for three years, divides
her ring with him. He forgets, and prepares to marry another
woman. She comes to the nuptials, and is not known. She throws
the half ring into a cup, drinks, and hands the cup to him. He
sees the half ring, and joins it to his own. This is my wife, he
says. She delivered me from death. He annuls his marriage, and
espouses the right woman. Miklosisch, Ueber die Mundarten der
Zigeuner, IV, M&auml;rchen u. Lieder, 15th Tale, pp 52-55, at the
end of a story of the class referred to at p. 401 f.
(K&ouml;hler.)</p>

<p>A personage appeared at Magdeburg in 1348 in the disguise of a
pilgrim, asked for a cup of wine from the archbishop's table,
and, in drinking, dropped into the cup from his mouth the seal
ring of the margrave Waldemar, supposed to have been long dead,
but whom he confessed or avowed himself to be. Kl&ouml;den,
Diplomatische Geschichte des f&uuml;r falsch erklarten Markgrafen
Waldemar, p. 189 f. (K&ouml;hler.)</p>

<p>A wife who long pursues her husband, lost to her through
spells, drops a ring into his broth at the feast for his second
marriage, is recognized, and they are happily reunited: The Tale
of the Hoodie, Campbell, West Highland Tales, I, 63-66.</p>

<p>In a pretty Portuguese ballad, which has numerous parallels in
other languages, a long-absent husband, after tormenting his wife
by telling her that she is a widow, legitimates himself by
saying, Where is your half of the ring which we parted? Here is
mine: 'Bella Infanta,' Almeida-Garrett, II, 11, 14, Braga, Cantos
p. do Archipelago A&ccedil;oriano, p. 300; 'Dona Infanta,' 'Dona
Catherina,' Braga, Romanceiro Geral, pp 3 f, 7.</p>

<p>See, further, for ring stories, Wesselofsky, Neue
Beitr&auml;ge zur Geschichte der Salomon sage, in Archiv f&uuml;r
Slavische Philologie, VI, 397 f; Hahn, Neugriechische
M&auml;rchen, No 25.</p>

<p>The cases in which a simple ring is the means of recognition
or confirmation need, of course, not be multiplied.</p>

<p>200 a, line twenty-four. For Alesha read Alyosha.</p>

<p>205. <b>G</b>. In Kinloch Manuscripts, VII, 117. After "from the recitation of my
niece, M. Kinnear, 23 August, 1826," is written in pencil "Christy Smith,"
who may have been the person from whom Miss Kinnear derived the ballad, or
another reciter. Changes are made in pencil, some of which are written over in
ink, some not. The printed copy, as usual with Kinloch, differs in some slight
respects from the manuscript.</p>
