<p>First taken into a collection by Kinloch, 1827, who remarks
that the ballad had been printed as a broadside in the North, and
was extremely popular. <b>B</b>, the oldest version that has been
recovered, was written down in 1802-3. There are verbal
agreements between <b>B</b>, especially, and a fragment in Herd's
Manuscripts (I, 55, II, 187, Herd's Scottish Songs, 1776, II, 6),
and there has been borrowing from one side or the other. Herd's
fragment belongs to a ballad of a shepherd's daughter and an earl
which is preserved in two copies in Motherwell's Manuscript (I,
37, 252). No 397 of The Musical Museum, communicated to Johnson,
says Stenhouse, by Burns, [1792,] and probably in a large measure
his work, begins with stanzas which may have been suggested by
the ballad before us or by the other. See an appendix.</p>

<p>The copy in Christie, I, 24, was epitomized from <b>A</b>
<b>b</b>, with some alterations. That in The Deeside Guide, 1889,
p. 17, is Aytoun's, compounded of <b>A</b> <b>b</b> and <b>D</b>
<b>a</b>.</p>

<p>Alexander Irvine, the young laird of Drum, says Spalding, was
married to the lady Mary Gordon on December 7, 1643: Memorials of
the Trubles in Scotland, etc., II, 296. Lady Mary Gordon was
fourth daughter to George the second Marquis of Huntly, and niece
to the Marquis of Argyll. The Laird of Drum suffered extremely in
his worldly fortunes through his fidelity to the cause of the
Stuarts. This would have been a natural reason for his declining
a peerage offered him at the Restoration, and for his marrying,
the second time, to win and not to spend. He took for his second
wife Margaret Coutts (<b>A</b> 9), "a woman of inferior birth and
manners, which step gave great offence to his relations."
(Kinloch.) He died in 1687. After the death of Irvine of Drum,
Margaret Coutts married Irvine of Cults. She died in 1710, at the
age of only forty-five.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d236_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
