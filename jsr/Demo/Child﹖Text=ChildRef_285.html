<p>March 19, 1611, there were entered to Richard Jones, "Captayne
Jenninges his songe, whiche he made in the Marshalsey," etc., and
"the second parte of the George Aloo and the Swiftestake, beinge
both ballades:" Arber, III, 456. The second part of the George
Aloo must needs mean a second ballad, not the printers' second
half (which begins in <b>c</b> at the stanza here numbered 14).
In 'The Two Noble Kinsmen,' printed in 1634, and perhaps earlier,
the Jailer's Daughter sings the two following stanzas (Dyce, XI,
386):</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>The George Alow came from the south,<br/>
From the coast of Barbary-a,<br/>
And there he met with brave gallants of war,<br/>
By one, by two, by three-a.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Well haild, well haild, you jolly gallants,<br/>
And whither now are you bound-a?<br/>
Oh, let me have your company<br/>
Till [I] come to the sound-a.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>These verses, whether accurately reported or not, certainly
seem to belong to another ballad. Whether they are from the first
part or the second part, we have no means of assuring ourselves.
It is to be observed that in the ballad before us the George Aloe
and the Sweepstake are sailing <i>for</i> Safee, and in the other
case the George Aloe is coming from the south, from the coast of
Barbary, so that the adventure, whatever it was, may have
occurred in the homeward voyage; but the circumstance is not
decisive.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d285_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The George Aloe and the Sweepstake, merchantmen, are bound for
Safee. The George Aloe anchors, the Sweepstake keeps on, is taken
by a French rover, and her crew thrown overboard. The George Aloe
hears of this, and sets out to take the Frenchman. Her second
shot carries away the enemy's mainmast; the Frenchmen cry for
mercy. The English ask what they did with the crew of the
Sweepstake; the Frenchmen confess that they threw them into the
sea. Such mercy as you shewed such mercy shall you have, say the
English, and deal with the French accordingly.</p>

<p>'Aboard,' 6<sup>2</sup>, 16<sup>2</sup>, I suppose to mean
alongside. 'Amain,' 7<sup>1</sup>, 16<sup>1</sup>, is strike
(sails) in sign of surrender. The French use the word derived
from their own language; the English say, strike. 'Gallant'
Englishmen in 7<sup>1</sup>, after 'English dogs' in
6<sup>1</sup>, is unlikely courtesy, and is not found in
16<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>'The Swepstacke' is a king's ship in 1545, and 'The
Sweepstakes' apparently again in 1666: Historical Manuscripts
Commission, 12th Report, Appendix, Part VII, pp. 8, 45.</p>
