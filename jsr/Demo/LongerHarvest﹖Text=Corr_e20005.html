<h3>200. The Gypsy Laddie</h3>


<p>P. 66. <b>B</b> <b>a</b>. A copy of this version in C.K.
Sharpe's papers, "written from recitation in Nithisdale,
November, 1814," shows that improvements had been introduced by
two hands, one of them Sharpe's, neither of them the writer's.
The changes are of no radical importance; simply of the familiar
kind which almost every editor has, for some reason, felt himself
called upon to make. It may be thought that they are no more
worth indicating than they were worth making, but it has been an
object in this book to give things exactly as they were
delivered. The original readings are as follows.</p>
