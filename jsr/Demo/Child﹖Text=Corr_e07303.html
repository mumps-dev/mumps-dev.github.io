<h3>73. Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</h3>


<p>P. 1 79 f. <b>D</b>. The Roxburghe copy of 'Lord Thomas and
Fair Eleanor,' III, 554, is printed by Mr. J.W. Ebsworth in the
Ballad Society's edition of the Roxburghe Ballads, VI, 647. (Mr.
Ebsworth notes that the broadside occurs in the Bagford Ballads,
II, 127; Douce, I, 120 v., Ill, 58 v., IV, 36; Ouvry, II, 38;
Jersey, III, 88.) 'The Unfortunate Forrester,' Roxburghe, II,
553, is printed at p. 645 of the same volume. A copy from singing
is given (with omissions) in Miss Burne's Shropshire Folk-Lore,
1883-86, p. 545; another, originally from recitation, in Mr. G.R.
Tomson's Ballads of the North Countrie, 1888, p. 82. Both came,
traditionally, from print. Still another, from the singing of a
Virginian nurse-maid (helped out by her mother), was communicated
by Mr. W.H. Babcock to the Folk-Lore Journal, VII, 33, 1889, and
may be repeated here, both because it is American and also
because of its amusing perversions.</p>
