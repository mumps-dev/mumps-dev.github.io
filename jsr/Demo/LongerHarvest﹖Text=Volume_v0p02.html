<h3>Preface</h3>

<p>These volumes have been compiled from the numerous collections
of Ballads printed since the beginning of the last century. They
contain all but two or three of the ancient ballads of England
and Scotland, and nearly all those ballads which, in either
country, have been gathered from oral tradition, &ndash; whether ancient
or not. Widely different from the true popular ballads, the
spontaneous products of nature, are the works of the professional
ballad-maker, which make up the bulk of Garlands and Broadsides.
These, though sometimes not without grace, more frequently not
lacking in humor, belong to artificial literature, &ndash; of course to
an humble department.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_v0p02_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>As many ballads of this second class have
been admitted as it was thought might be wished for, perhaps I
should say tolerated, by the "benevolent reader." No words could
express the dulness and inutility of a collection which should
embrace all the Roxburghe and Pepys broadsides &ndash; a scope with
which this publication was most undeservedly credited by an
English journal. But while the broadside ballads have been and
must have been gleaned, the popular ballads demand much more
liberal treatment. Many of the older ones are mutilated, many
more are miserably corrupted, but as long as any traces of their
originals are left, they are worthy of attention and have
received it. When a ballad is extant in a variety of forms, all
the most important versions are given. &ndash; Less than this would have
seemed insufficient for a collection intended as a complement to
an extensive series of the British Poets. To meet the objections
of readers for pleasure, all those pieces which are wanting in
general interest are in each volume inserted in an appendix.</p>

<p>The ballads are grouped in eight Books, nearly corresponding
to the division of volumes. The arrangement in the several Books
may be called chronological, by which is meant, an arrangement
according to the probable antiquity of the story, not the age of
the actual form or language. Exceptions to this rule will be
observed, partly the result of oversight, partly of fluctuating
views; the most noticeable case is in the First Book, where the
ballads that stand at the beginning are certainly not so old as
some that follow. Again, it is very possible that some pieces
might with advantage be transferred to different Books, but it is
believed that the general disposition will be found practically
convenient. It is as follows:</p>

<p>BOOK I. contains Ballads involving Superstitions of various
kinds, &ndash; as of Fairies, Elves, Water-spirits, Enchantment, and
Ghostly Apparitions; and also some Legends of Popular Heroes.</p>

<p>BOOK II. Tragic Love-ballads.</p>

<p>BOOK III. other Tragic Ballads.</p>

<p>BOOK IV. Love-ballads not Tragic.</p>

<p>BOOK V. Ballads of Robin Hood, his followers, and 
compeers.</p>

<p>BOOK VI. Ballads of other Outlaws, especially Border Outlaws,
of Border Forays, Feuds, &amp;c.</p>

<p>BOOK VII.Historical Ballads, or those relating to public
characters or events.</p>

<p>BOOK VIII. Miscellaneous Ballads, especially Humorous,
Satirical, Burlesque; also some specimens of the Moral and
Scriptural, and all such pieces as had been overlooked in
arranging the earlier volumes.</p>

<p>For the Texts, the rule has been to select the most authentic
copies, and to reprint them as they stand in the collections,
restoring readings that had been changed without grounds, and
noting all deviations from the originals, whether those of
previous editors or of this edition, in the margin.
Interpolations acknowledged by the editors have generally been
dropped. In two instances only have previously printed texts been
superseded or greatly improved: the text of The Horn of King
Arthur, in the first volume, was furnished from the manuscript,
by J. O. Halliwell, Esq., and Adam Bel, in the fifth volume, has
been amended by a recently discovered fragment of an excellent
edition, kindly communicated by J. P. Collier, Esq.</p>

<p>The Introductory Notices prefixed to the several ballads may
seem dry and somewhat meagre. They will be found, it is believed,
to comprise what is most essential even for the less cursory
reader to know. These prefaces are intended to give an account of
all the printed forms of each ballad, and references to the books
in which they were first published. In many cases also, the
corresponding ballads in other languages, especially in Danish,
Swedish, and German, are briefly pointed out. But these last
notices are very imperfect. Fascinating as such investigations
are, they could not be allowed to interfere with the progress of
the series of Poets of which this collection of Ballads forms a
part, nor were the necessary books immediately at hand. At a more
favorable time the whole subject may be resumed, unless some
person better qualified shall take it up in the interim.</p>

<p>While upon this point let me make the warmest acknowledgments
for the help received from Grundtvig's Ancient Popular Ballads of
Denmark (Danmarics Gamle Folkeviser), a work which has no equal
in its line, and which may in every way serve as a model for
collections of National Ballads. Such a work as Grundtvig's can
only be imitated by an English editor, never equalled, for the
material is not at hand. All Denmark seems to have combined to
help on his labors; schoolmasters and clergymen, in those retired
nooks where tradition longest lingers, have been very active in
taking down ballads from the mouths of the people, and a large
number of old manuscripts have been placed at his disposal. &ndash; We
have not even the Percy Manuscript at our command, and must be
content to take the ballads as they are printed in the Reliques,
with all the editor's changes. This manuscript is understood to
be in the hands of a dealer who is keeping it from the public in
order to enhance its value. The greatest service that can now be
done to English Ballad-literature is to publish this precious
document. Civilization has made too great strides in the island
of Great Britain for us to expect much more from tradition.</p>

<p>Certain short romances which formerly stood in the First Book,
have been dropped from thise second Edition, in order to give the
collection a homogeneous character. One or two ballads have been
added, and some of the prefaces considerably enlarged.</p>
