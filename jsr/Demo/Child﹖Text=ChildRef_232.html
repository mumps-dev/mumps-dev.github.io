<p>The youngest (eldest, <b>A</b>) and fairest of the daughters
of the Earl of Wigton, <b>A</b>, <b>F</b> (bonniest of his
sisters, <b>B</b>), has fallen in love with her footman, Kichie
Story (Tory). Richie brings her a letter from a nobleman who
desires to be her suitor; the Earl of Hume, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>F</b>, <b>G</b> <b>a</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>e</b>; the Earl of
Hume's son, <b>D</b>; the Earl of Aboyne, <b>B</b>; of
Cumbernauld, <b>G</b> <b>b</b>; of Mohun, <b>G</b> <b>c</b>; of
Wemyss, <b>G</b> <b>f</b> and a variant of <b>E</b>; the Earls of
Hume and Skimmerjim, Skimmerham (Kimmerghame), <b>C</b>. The lady
has made a vow, and will keep it, to marry none but Richie.
Richie deprecates; he has nothing to maintain her with; she is
ready to descend to the lowest fortune. (In several versions she
has enough of her own. Hunten Tour and Tillebarn and the House of
Athol are hers, <b>B</b>; Musselbtirgh, <b>C</b>; the House of
Athol and Taranadie, <b>G</b> <b>d</b>; Blair-in-Athol and
Dunkeld, <b>H</b>.) Asked by her sister, by Richie, or by some
one else, whether she is not sorry to have left Curabernauld
(Castle Norry, <b>G</b> <b>f</b>) to follow a footman, she
answers that there is no reason, she has her heart's desire and
the lot that was ordained her. As she goes up the Parliament
close, rides through Edinburgh town, Glasgow city (London city,
<b>C</b> <b>b</b>, absurdly), she is greeted by many a lord, but
few or none of them thought she was a footman's lady. Arrived at
the domicile of the Storys, her good-mother bids her, gars her,
kilt up her coats and muck the byres with Richie.</p>

<p><b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, are not satisfied with this conclusion.
The footman is really a lover in disguise, the Earl of Hume or of
Cumbernauld, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b> <b>a</b> <b>b</b>. (<b>G</b>
<b>b</b> 2 spoils the plot by making the Earl of Hume write to
the lady that he will be her footman-laddie.) Four-and-twenty
gentlemen welcome the bride at Ritchie's gates, or elsewhere, and
she blesses the day that she was Richie's lady. This is
incontestably a later invention.</p>

<p><b>G</b> <b>f</b>, which is otherwise embellished, goes a good
step beyond <b>G</b> <b>a</b>-<b>e</b>. Richie is an Englishman
and takes the lady to London. 'Madam' has left her kindred to
gang with a servant; he has 'left the sceptre and the crown' her
servant for to be; little she knew that her waiting-man was
England's royal king.</p>

<p>"Lillias Fleming, second daughter of John, Earl of Wigton by
his wife Jane Drummond (a daughter of the Earl of Perth), did
elope with and marry one of her father's servants, named Richard
Storry. In 1673, she, with consent of her husband, resigned her
portion, consisting of the five-merk land of Smythson, etc., in
the barony of Lenzie, into the hands of her brother,
Lieutenant-Colonel Fleming. The Fleming family afterwards
procured for Richie a situation in the Custom-House." So Hunter,
Biggar and the House of Fleming, p. 555, and, in part, Douglas's
Peerage, where, however, Lady Lillias is said to have married
Richard Storry, "Esq.:" ed. Wood, II, 616.</p>

<p>Douglas notes that "John, third Earl of Wigton, ... had a
charter of the lordship of Cumbernauld, 1st February, 1634." This
place (Comarnad, Campernadie, etc., <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>G</b>
<b>a</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>) is in Dumbartonshire. In <b>F</b>
11 it is attributed to the young Earl of Hume, and the disguised
lover is the Earl of Cumbernauld in <b>G</b> <b>b</b>.</p>

<p>The lady, ready for any extremity, says in <b>F</b> 6 that she
will lie ayont a dyke (on the other side of a wall), in <b>B</b>
6 sit below the dyke, in <b>D</b> 5 sit aneath the duke, and that
she will be at Richie's command at all times. This matter was not
understood by the reciter of <b>B</b>, and in <b>B</b> 7 the lady
is made to say, We will go to sea, I'll sit upon the deck (and be
your servant, as in the other cases). In <b>A</b> the difficulty,
such as it is, seems to have been evaded, and we read, 6, I'll
live whereer you please (and be ready at your call late or
early).</p>

Duke of Athol,' see an appendix.</p>
