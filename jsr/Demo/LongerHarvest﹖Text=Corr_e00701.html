<h3>7. Earl Brand</h3>

<p>P. 88. Add:</p>

<p><b>G</b>. 'Gude Earl Brand and Auld Carle Hude,' the Paisley
Magazine, 1828, p. 321, communicated by W. Motherwell.</p>

<p><b>H</b>. 'Auld Carle Hood, or, Earl Brand,' Campbell Manuscipts, 
II, 32.</p>

<p><b>I</b> . 'The Douglas Tragedy,' 'Lord Douglas' Tragedy,'
from an old-looking stall-copy, without place or date.</p>

<p>This ballad was, therefore, not first given to the world by
Mr. Robert Bell, in 1857, but nearly thirty years earlier by
Motherwell, in the single volume of the Paisley Magazine, a now
somewhat scarce book. I am indebted for the information and for a
transcript to Mr. Murdoch, of Glasgow, and for a second copy to
Mr. Macmath, of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>92 a. Add: <b>I</b>. 'Hildebrand,' Wigstr&ouml;m.
Folkdiktning, II, 13. <b>J</b>. 'Fr&ouml;ken Gyllenborg,' the
same, p. 24.</p>

<p>96 a. B&ouml;&eth;var Bjarki, fighting with great effect as a
huge bear for Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki, is obliged to return to his
ordinary shape in consequence of Hjalti, who misses the hero from
the fight, mentioning his name: Saga Hr&oacute;lfs Kraka, c. 50,
Fornaldar S&ouml;gur, I, 101 ff. In Hjalmters ok &Ouml;lvers
Saga, c. 20, F.S. III, 506 f, H&ouml;r&eth;r bids his comrades
not call him by name while he is fighting, in form of a
sword-fish, with a walrus, else he shall die. A prince, under the
form of an ox, fighting with a six-headed giant, loses much of
his strength, and is nigh being conquered, because a lad has,
contrary to his prohibition, called him by name.
Asbj&oslash;rnsen og Moe, Norske Folkeeventyr, 2d ed., p. 419.
All these are cited by Moe, in Nordisk Tidskrift, 1879, p. 286 f.
Certain kindly domestic spirits renounce relations with men, even
matrimonial, if their name becomes known: Mannhardt, Wald- und
Feldkulte, I, 103.</p>

<p>97 b. Insert: <b>Spanish</b>. Mil&aacute;, Romancerillo
Catalan, 2d ed., No 206, <b>D</b>, p. 164: olivera y
oliver&aacute;, which, when grown tall, join.</p>

<p><b>Servian</b>. Add: Karadshitch, I, 345, vv 225 ff, two
pines, which intertwine. In <b>I</b> 309, No 421, they plant a
rose over the maid, a vine over the man, which embrace as if they
were Jani and Milenko. The ballad has features of the Earl Brand
class. (I, 239, No 341 = Talvj, II, 85.)</p>

<p><b>Russian</b>. Hilferding, Onezhskya Byliny, col. 154, No 31,
laburnum (?) over Basil, and cypress over Sophia, which
intertwine; col. 696, No 134, cypress and willow; col. 1242, No
285, willow and cypress.</p>

<p>Little Russian (Carpathian Russians in Hungary), Golovatsky,
II, 710, No 13: John on one side of the church, Annie on the
other; rosemary on his grave, a lily on hers, growing so high as
to meet over the church. Annie's mother cuts them down. John
speaks from the grave: Wicked mother, thou wouldst not let us
<i>live</i> together; let us rest together. Golovatsky, I, 186,
No 8: a maple from the man's grave, white birch from the woman's,
which mingle their leaves.</p>

<p><b>Slovenian</b>. &#352;t&uacute;r, O n&aacute;rodn&iacute;ch
P&iacute;sn&iacute;ch a Pov&#277;stech Plemen slovansk&yacute;ch,
p. 51: the lovers are buried east and west, a rose springs from
the man's grave, a lily from the maid's, which mingle their
growth.</p>

<p><b>Wend</b>. Add: Haupt and Schmaler, II, 310, No 81.</p>

<p><b>Breton</b>. Add: Villemarqu&eacute;, Barzaz Breiz, 'Le
Seigneur Nann et La F&eacute;e,' see p. 379, note &#167;, of this
volume.</p>

<p>98 a. <b>Armenian</b>. The ashes of two lovers who have been
literally consumed by a mutual passion are deposited by
sympathetic hands in one grave and seek to intertwine, but a
thorn interposes and makes the union forever impossible.  (The
thorn is <i>creed</i>. The young man was a Tatar, and his religion
had been an insuperable obstacle in the eyes of the maid's
father.) Baron von Haxthausen, Transkaukasia, I, 315 f.
(K&ouml;hler.)</p>

<p>A Middle High German poem from a Manuscript of the end of the
14th century, printed in Haupt's Zeitschrift, VI, makes a vine
rise from the common grave of Pyramus and Thisbe and descend into
it again: p. 517. (K&ouml;hler.)</p>

<p>J. Grimm notes several instances of this marvel (not
from ballads), Ueber Frauennamen aus
Blumen, Kleinere Schriften, II, 379 f, note **</p>

<p>104, Add <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>.</p>

<p>H, end-notes:</p>

<p>21<sup>1</sup>. to her.<br/>

21<sup>1</sup>, 22 <i>are written as one stanza.</i></p>

<p>I, end-notes:</p>

<p>105 b. <b>D</b> . 10. For Kinlock (twice) read Kinloc<b>h</b>;
and read <b>I</b>, 330.</p>

<p>The stanza cited is found in Kinloch Manuscripts, VII, 95 and
255.</p>

<p>107 b. There is possibly a souvenir of Walter in Su&#353;il,
p. 105, No 107. A man and woman are riding on one horse in the
mountains. He asks her to sing. Her song is heard by robbers, who
come, intending to kill him and carry her off: He bids her go
under a maple-tree, kills twelve, and spares one, to carry the
booty home.</p>
