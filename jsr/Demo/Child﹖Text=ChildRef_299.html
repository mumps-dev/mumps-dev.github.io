<h3>Trooper and Maid</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'The Trooper and Fair Maid,' Buchan's Ballads of
the North of Scotland, I, 230. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d29901.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
<li>'The Trooper,' Motherwell's Manuscript, p. 27. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d29902.html"><i>Version B</i></a></li>
<li>Jamieson's Scottish Ballads, II, 158. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d29903.html"><i>Version C</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>A trooper comes to the house of his mistress in the evening
and is kindly received. They pass the night together and are
wakened by the trumpet. He must leave her; she follows him some
way, he begging her to turn back. She asks him repeatedly when
they are to meet again and marry. He answers, when cockle shells
grow siller bells, when fishes fly and seas gang dry, etc.: see
I, 168, 437.</p>

<p>There are several other ballads of a trooper and a maid
(Peggy). In 'The Bonnie Lass o Fyvie,' Christie, I, 276, Murison
Manuscript, p. 50, Kinloch Manuscripts, VII, 339, Buchan
Manuscripts, II, 270, 'Irish Dragoons,' Motherwell's Manuscripts,
p. 428, a captain falls in love with a Peggy and dies thereof;
but in another copy, 'Pretty Peggy,' Gibb Manuscript, No 13, p.
53, all is made to end well. A dragoon very constant and liberal
to Peggy, and she very fond to him, are happily married in 'The
Dragoon and Peggy,' Maidment, Scotish Ballads and Songs, 1859, p.
98, from a Glasgow copy of the date 1800. The first half of this
ballad is found under the title of 'The Laird of Kellary ' in
Kinloch Manuscripts, I, 359. In an English broadside which is
perhaps of the first half of the seventeenth century, a married
Peggy leaves her husband to follow a soldier over sea, but
returns and is forgiven: 'The Soldier and Peggy,' Roxburghe
collection, I, 370 (also Pepys, Euing, Douce), Chappell, The
Roxburghe Ballads, II, 475. 'Peggie is over the sie with the
souldier ' is the title of a tune (No 95) in the Skene
Manuscripts, which date from the first quarter of the seventeenth
century. A correspondent of C.K. Sharpe sent him one stanza of a
Scottish ballad upon this theme:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Peggie's gane oer the seas, a' dressed in red,<br/>
An Peggie's come back again, beggin her bread.<br/>
The landladie looked wi the tail o her ee:<br/>
'O foul fa ye, Peggie, for leaving o me.'</td></tr>

</table>

<p>There is also a ballad of a valiant trooper and a pretty Peggy
who, at first inconstant, turns out a loving wife, in Pepys, IV,
40, No 37.</p>
