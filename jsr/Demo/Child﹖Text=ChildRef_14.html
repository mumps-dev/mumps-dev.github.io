<p><b>B</b> <b>a</b> is from tradition of the latter half of the
eighteenth century; the other copies from the earlier part of
this.</p>

<p>Three sisters go out (together, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
successively, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>) to gather flowers (<b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>E</b>). A banished man (outlyer bold, <b>D</b>,
London lord, <b>E</b>) starts up from a hiding-place, and offers
them one after the other the choice of being his wife or dying by
his hand.</p>

Or will ye die by my wee penknife?'</td></tr>

</table>

<p>The first and the second express a simple preference for death,
and are killed and laid by, "to bear the red rose company"
(<b>A</b>). The youngest, in <b>A</b>, says she has a brother in
the wood, who will kill him if he kills her. The outlaw asks the
brother's name, finds that he himself is the man, and takes his
own life with the same weapon that had shed the blood of his
sisters. <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> have three brothers, the
youngest of whom is the banished lord (<b>C</b>), the outlyer
bold (<b>D</b>). The story is defective in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>. In
<b>D</b> the outlaw, on finding what he has done, takes a long
race, and falls on his knife. The conclusion of <b>A</b> is not
so finely tragic. A brother John comes riding by just as the
robber is about to kill the third sister, apprehends him by the
agency of his three pages, and reserves him to be hanged on a
tree,</p>

<p>Or thrown into the poisond lake,<br/>
To feed the toads and rattle-snake.</p>

<p>According to the account given by Herd, and repeated by
Jamieson, the story of the lost conclusion of <b>B</b> made the
banished man discover that he had killed his two brothers as well
as his two sisters. This ballad, with additional circumstances,
is familiar to all branches of the,Scandinavian race.</p>

<p><b>Danish</b>. There are many versions from oral tradition, as
yet unprinted, besides these two: <b>A</b>, 'Hr. Truels's
D&oslash;ttre,' Danske Viser, III, 392, No 164, there reprinted
from Sandvig, Beskrivelse over &Oslash;en M&oslash;en, 1776:
<b>B</b>, 'Herr Thors B&oslash;rn,' from recent tradition of
North Sleswig, Berggreen, Danske FolkeSange, 3d ed., p. 88, No
42.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Herr Truels' three daughters oversleep their matins
one morning, and are roused by their mother. If we have overslept
our matins, they say, we will make up at high mass. They set out
for church, and in a wood fall in with three robbers, who say:</p>

<p>Whether will ye be three robbers' wives,<br/>
Or will ye rather lose your lives?'</p>

<p>Much rather death, say they. The two elder sisters submitted to
their fate without a word; the third made a hard resistance. With
her last breath she adjured the robbers to seek a lodging at Herr
Truels' that night. This they did. They drank so long that they
drank Herr Truels to bed. Then they asked his wife to promise
herself to all three. First, she said, she must look into their
bags. In their bags she saw her daughters' trinkets. She excused
herself for a moment, barred the door strongly, roused her
husband, and made it known to him that these guests had killed
his three daughters. Herr Truels called on all his men to arm. He
asked the robbers who was their father. They said that they had
been stolen by robbers, on their way to school, one day; had had
a hard life for fourteen years; and the first crime they had
committed was killing three maids yesterday. Herr Truels revealed
to them that they had murdered their sisters, and offered them
new clothes, in which they might go away. "Nay," they said, "not
so; life for life is meet." They were taken out of the town, and
their heads struck off. <b>B</b> differs from <b>A</b> in only a
few points. The robbers ask lodging at Herr Thor's, as being
pilgrims. When be discovers their true character, he threatens
them with the wheel. They say, Shall we come to the wheel? Our
father drinks Yule with the king. They tell him their story, and
their father offers them saddle and horse to make their best way
off. They reply, "We will
<a name="Page_I_172"/>
give blood for blood," spread their
cloaks on the floor, and let their blood run.</p>

<p><b>Swedish</b>. 'Pehr Tyrsons D&ouml;ttrar i W&auml;nge.'
<b>A</b>, Arwidsson, II, 413, No 166. <b>B</b>, Afzelius, III,
193, No 98: ed. Bergstr&ouml;m, 380, No 84, 1. <b>C</b>,
Afzelius, 11I, 197: ed. Bergstr&ouml;m, 1, 382, No 84, 2, as old
as the last half of the seventeenth century. <b>D</b>, Afzelius,
202: ed. Bergstr&ouml;m, 1, 384, No 84, 3. <b>E</b>, "C.J.
Wess&eacute;n, De paroecia K&auml;rna (an academical
dissertation), Upsala, 1836," Arwidsson, as above, who mentions
another unprinted copy in the Royal Library.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Herr T&ouml;res' daughters overslept matins, dressed
themselves handsomely, and set off for mass. All on the heath
they were met by three wood-robbers, who demanded, Will ye be our
wives, or lose your lives? The first answered: God save us from
trying either! the second, Rather let us range the world! the
third, Better death with honor! But</p>

<p>First were they the three wood-robbers' wives,<br/>
And after that they lost their young lives.</p>

<p>The robbers strip them; then go and ask to be taken in by Herr
T&ouml;res. He serves them with mead and wine, but presently
begins to wish his daughters were at home. His wife sees him to
bed; then returns to her guests, who offer her a silken sark to
pass the night with them. "Give me a sight of the silken sark,"
she cries, with prophetic soul: "God have mercy on my daughters!"
She rouses her husband, and tells him that the robbers have slain
his bairns. He puts on his armor and kills two of them: the third
begs to be spared till he can say who were his kin; his father's
name is Mires! Father and mother resolve to build a church for
penance, and it shall be called Kerna. <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>. The girls meet three "vallare," strolling men, and none
of them good (<b>C</b>). The robbers cut off the girls' heads on
the trunk of a birch (cf. English <b>C</b> 5: "It 's lean your
head upon my staff," and with his pen-knife he has tutted it
aff): three springs burst forth immediately. They go to the
house, and ask the mother if she will buy silken sarks that nine
maids have stitched (<b>B</b>). She says:</p>

<p>Open your sacks, and let me see:<br/>
Mayhap I shall know them all three.'</p>

<p>The father, in <b>B</b>, when he discovers that he has slain
his own sons, goes to the smith, and has an iron band fastened
round his middle. The parents vow to build a church as an
expiation, and it shall be called Kerna (<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>).</p>

<p><b>F&auml;r&ouml;e</b>. 'Torkilds Riim, eller St. Catharine?
Vise,' Lyngbye, F&aelig;r&oslash;iske Qv&aelig;der, In this form
of the story, as in the Icelandic versions which follow, the
robbers are not the brothers of the maids. Torkild's two
daughters sleep till the sun shines on their beds. Their father
wakens them, and tells Katrine she is waited for at church.
Katrine dresses herself splendidly, but does not disdain to
saddle her own horse.</p>

<p>And since no knave was ready to help,<br/>
Katrine bridled the horse herself.</p>

<p>And since no knave was standing about,<br/>
Herself put the bit in her horse's mouth.</p>

<p>First she came upon three strollers (vadlarar<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d014_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>), then two,
then one, and the last asked her whether she would pass the night
with him (vera qv&ouml;ldar vujv) or die. He cut off her head, and
wherever her blood ran a light kindled; where her head fell a
spring welled forth: where her body lay a church was [afterwards]
built. The rover came to Torkild's house, and the father asked if
he had seen Katrine. He said she had been at Mary kirk the day
before, and asked for a lodging, feigning to be sick. This was
readily granted. He went to bed, and Aasa, the other sister,
waited upon him. He offered her a silken sark to sleep with him.
Aasa asked to see the sark first, and found on it her sister's
mark.
<a name="Page_I_173"/>
The fellow went on to offer her a blue cloak and gold crown
successively, and on both of these she saw her sister's mark.
Aasa bade him good-night, went to her father, and told him that
the man they had housed had killed his daughter. Torkild ordered
his swains to light a pile in the wood: early the next morning
they burned the murderer on it.</p>

<p><b>Icelandic</b>. Five Icelandic versions, and the first
stanza of two more, are given in Islenzk Fornkv&aelig;&eth;i, I,
108 ff, No 15, Vallara kv&aelig;&eth;i.'</p>

<p>The story is nearly the same as in the F&auml;r&ouml;e ballad.
Two of Thorkell's daughters sleep till, after the sun is up
(<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>). They wash and dress; they set out for
church (<b>C</b>). On the heath they encounter a strolling man,
<b>A</b>; a tall, large man, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>; a horseman or
knight, <b>D</b>. He greets them: "Why will ye not speak? Are ye
come of elves, or of kings themselves?" <b>A</b>. [Are ye come of
earls, or of beggar-churls? <b>B</b>]. They answer, We are not
come of elves, nor of kings themselves; we are Thorkell's
daughters, and serve Mary kirk. He asks, Will ye choose to lose
your life, or shall I rather take you to wife ? The choice, they
say, is hard: they would rather, die. He kills them and buries
them. At night he goes to Thorkell's house, where Asa is alone.
He knocks to be let in; Asa refuses; he draws the latch with his
deft fingers (<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>). He offers Asa a
silken sark to sleep with him [and a blue cloak to say nothing,
<b>A</b>]. She asked to see the sark, and knew her sisters' work,
begged him to wait a moment, went to her father, and told him
that the murderer of his daughters was there. Thorkell dashed his
harp to the floor [and kicked over the table, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>]. The murderer in the morning was hanged like a dog,
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. [Thorkell tore at his hair and cut him down
with an elder-stock, <b>C</b>; they fought three days, and on the
fourth the villain was hanged in a strap, <b>E</b>, the knight was
hanging like a dog, <b>D</b>]. A miraculous light burned over the
place where the maids had been buried, <b>A</b> 16, <b>C</b> 27,
<b>D</b> 24, <b>E</b> 12. When their bodies were taken into the
church, the bells rang of themselves, <b>D</b>.</p>

<p><b>Norwegian</b> versions of this ballad have been obtained
from tradition, but none as yet have been published.</p>

<p>"The mains and burn of Fordie, the banks of which are very
beautiful," says Aytoun (I, 159), "lie about six miles to the
east of Dunkeld." Tradition has connected the story with half a
dozen localities in Sweden, and, as Professor Grundtvig informs
me, with at least eight places in the different provinces of
Denmark. The Kerna, church of the Swedish ballads, not far from
Link&ouml;ping (Afzelius), has been popularly supposed to derive
its name from a Catharina, Karin, or Karna, killed by her own
brother, a wood-robber, near its site. See Afzelius, ed.
Bergstr&ouml;m, II, 329 ff Danske Viser, ill, 444 f.</p>

<p><b>A</b> is translated by Grundtvig, Engelske og skotske
Folkeviser, No 34, p. 216, and, with some slight use of Aytoun,
I, 160, by Rosa Warrens, Schottische Volkslieder der Vorzeit, No
18, p. 85. Danish A, by Prior, III, 252.</p>
