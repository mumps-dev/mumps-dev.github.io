<h3>List of the Principal Collections
of English and Scottish Ballads and Songs</h3>

<p>[This list does not include (excepting a few reprints) the
collections of Songs, Madrigals, "Ballets," &amp;c., published in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, &ndash; the titles of most of which
are to be seen in Rimbault's Bibliotheca Madrigaliana. On the
other hand, it does include a few useful books connected with
ballad-poetry which would not properly come into a list of
collections. The relative importance of the works in this list is
partially indicated by difference of type. When two or more
editions are mentioned, those used in this collection are
distinguished by brackets. A few books which we have not
succeeded in finding &ndash; all of slight or no importance &ndash; are marked
with a star.]</p>
