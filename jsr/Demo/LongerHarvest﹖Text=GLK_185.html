<h3>185. Dick o the Cow</h3>

<p><b>a</b> seems to have been communicated to Percy by Roger
Halt in 1775. b was contributed to Caw's Museum by John Elliot of
Reidheugh, a gentleman, says Scott, well skilled in the
antiquities of the western border, c was taken down "from the
singing and recitation of a Liddesdale-man, namely, Robert
Shortreed, sheriff-substitute of Roxburghshire, in the autumn of
1816;" but it differs from b in no important respect except the
omission of thirteen stanzas, 17, 18, 24, 32, 35-38, 51, 52,
5658. The ballad was popular before the end of the sixteenth
century, as is shown by a passage in Nashe's Have with you to
Saffron Walden, 1596: "Dick of the Cow, that mad demi-lance
northren borderer, who plaied his prizes with the lord Jockey so
bravely" (Grosart's Nashe, III, 6). In a list of books printed
for and sold by P. Brooksby, 1688, occurs "Dick-athe-Cow,
containing north-country songs." The Cow in Dick's name can have
no reference to cattle, for then his style would have been 'Dick
o the Kye.' It may possibly denote the hut in which he lived; or
brush, or broom.</p>
