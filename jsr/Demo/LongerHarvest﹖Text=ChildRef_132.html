<h3>The Bold Pedlar and Robin Hood</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>J.H. Dixon, Ancient Poems, Ballads,
and Songs of the Peasantry of England, p. 71,
Percy Society, vol. xvii, 1846.  <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d13201.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>"An aged female in Bermondsey, Surrey, from whose oral
recitation the editor took down the present version, informed
him, that she had often beard her grandmother sing it, and that
it was never in print; but he has of late met witb several common
stall copies."</p>

<p>Robin Hood and Little Jobn fall in with a pedlar. Little Jobn
asks what goods he carries, and says he will have half his pack.
The pedlar says he shall have tbe whole if be can make him give a
perch of ground. They fight, and John cries Hold. Robin Hood
undertakes the pedlar, and in turn cries Hold. Robin asks the
pedlar's name. He will not give it till they have told theirs,
and when they have so done says it still lies with him to tell or
not. However, he is Gamble Gold, forced to flee his country for
killing a man. If you are Gamble Gold, says Robin, you are my own
cousin. They go to a tavern and dine and drink.</p>

<p>Stanzas 11, 12, 15 recall Robin Hood's Delight, No 136, 19,
20, 24; 13, 14 Robin Hood Revived, No 128, 17, 18. As remarked
under No 128, this is a traditional variation of Robin Hood
Revived.</p>
