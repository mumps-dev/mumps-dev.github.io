<p>By far the most circumstantial account of the battle of
Otterburn is given by Froissart (Chroniques, Buchon, XI, 362 ff,
chap. 115 ff), and his highly felicitous narrative may be briefly
summarized as follows.</p>

<p>The quarrels of Richard II with his uncles and a consequent
feud between the great northern families of Neville and Percy
furnished the Scots an inviting opportunity for an invasion of
England on a large scale. Under the pretext of a festive meeting,
a preliminary conference of barons and knights was held at
Aberdeen, and it was there agreed that they should muster, the
middle of August, 1388, at a place on the border near Jedburgh,
with such forces as they could command. In all this they took no
counsel with the king, who was then past seventy, and was
regarded as of no account for their purposes. The result was a
larger gathering than had been seen for sixty years, quite twelve
hundred lances and forty thousand ordinary fighting-men.</p>

<p>The Earl of Northumberland and his sons, the Seneschal of
York, and the Captain of Berwick had heard of the intended
meeting at Aberdeen, and had sent heralds and minstrels thither,
to get further information. These agents reported that all
Scotland was astir, and that there was to be another parley in
the forest of Jedburgh. The barons and knights of Northumberland
made due preparations, and, the better to keep these secret,
remained quiet in their houses, ready to sally as soon as they
learned that the Scots were in motion. Feeling themselves
incapable of coping with so large a body as had been collected,
they decided upon a simultaneous counter-raid, and that from the
east or from, the west, according as the enemy should take the
road from the west or the east. Of this plan of the English the
Scots obtained knowledge from a spy whom they had captured, and
to foil it they divided their army, directing the main body
towards Carlisle, under command of Archibald Douglas, of the Earl
of Fife, son of the king, and many other nobles, while a
detachment of three or four hundred picked men-at-arms, supported
by two thousand stout fellows, partly archers, all well
mounted,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d161_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and commanded by James, Earl of Douglas, the Earl
of March and Dunbar, and the Earl of Murray, were to strike for
Newcastle, cross the river, and burn and ravage the bishopric of
Durham.</p>

<p>The eastern division (with which alone we are concerned)
carried out their program to the letter. They advanced at speed,
stopping for nothing, and meeting with no resistance, and the
burning and pillaging had begun in Durham before the Earl of
Northumberland knew of their arrival. Fire and smoke soon showed
what was going on. The earl dispatched his sons Henry and Ralph
Percy to Newcastle, where the whole country rallied, gentle and
simple; he himself remaining at Alnwick, in the hope of being
able to enclose the Scots, when they should take the way north,
between two bodies of English. The Scots attained to the very
gates of Durham; then, having burned every unfortified town
between there and Newcastle, they turned northward, with a large
booty, repassed the Tyne, and halted at Newcastle. There was
skirmishing for two days before the city, and in the course of a
long combat between Douglas and Henry Percy the Scot got
possession of the Englishman's pennon. This he told Percy he
would raise on the highest point of his castle at Dalkeith; Percy
answered that he should never accomplish that vaunt, nor should
he carry the pennon out of Northumberland. 'Come then to-night
and win it back,' said Douglas; 'I will plant it before my tent.'
It was then late, and the fighting ceased; but the Scots kept
good guard, looking for Percy to come that very night for his
pennon. Percy, however, was constrained to let that night
pass.</p>

<p>The Scots broke up their camp early the next morning and
withdrew homewards. Taking and burning the tower and town of
Ponteland on their way, they moved on to Otterburn, thirty miles
northwest from Newcastle, where there was a strong castle or
tower, in marshy ground, which they assailed for a day without
success. At the end of the day they held a council, and the
greater part were in favor of making for Carlisle in the morning,
to rejoin their countrymen. But the Earl of Douglas would not
hear of this; Henry Percy had said that he would challenge his
pennon; they would stay two or three days more and assault the
castle, and see if Percy would be as good as his word. So the
Scots encamped at their ease, making themselves huts of trees,
and availing themselves of the marshes to fortify their position.
At the entrance of the marshes, which was on the Newcastle road,
they put their servants and foragers, and they drove their cattle
into the bogs.</p>

<p>Henry Percy was greatly vexed and mortified at the loss of his
pennon, and in the evening he represented to the knights and
squires of Northumberland how much it concerned his honor to make
good what he had said to Douglas, that the pennon should never be
carried out of England. But these gentlemen were all convinced
that Douglas was backed by the whole power of Scotland, of which
they had seen only the van, by forty thousand men who could
handle them at their will; at any rate, it was better to lose a
pennon than two or three hundred knights and squires, and expose
the country to risk. As for the loss of the pennon, it was one of
the chances of arms; Douglas had won it handsomely; another time
Percy would get as much from him, or more.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d161_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> To this the
Percys were fain to yield. Later there came scouts with
information that Douglas was encamped at Otterburn, that the main
army was not acting in conjunction with him, and that his forces,
all told, did not exceed three thousand. Henry Percy was
overjoyed at the news, and cried, To horse! by the faith I owe to
God and my father, I will go seek my pennon, and the Scots shall
be ousted before this night is over. The evening of that same day
the Bishop of Durham was expected to arrive with a great many
men, but Henry Percy would not wait. Six hundred lances and eight
thousand foot were enough, he said, to serve the Scots, who had
but three hundred lances and two thousand other folk. The English
set forth as soon as they could get together, by the road which
the Scots had taken, but were not able to move very fast by
reason of their infantry.</p>

<p>Some of the Scots knights were supping, and more were asleep
(for they had had hard work at the assault on the tower, and were
meaning to be up betimes to renew the attack), when the English
were upon the camp, crying, Percy! Percy! There was naturally
great alarm. The English made their attack at that part of the
camp where, as before said, the servants and foragers were
lodged. This was, however, strong, and the knights sent some of
their men to hold it while they themselves were arming. Then the
Scots formed, each under his own earl and captain. It was night,
but the weather was fair and the moon shining. The Scots did not
go straight for the English, but took their way along by the
marshes and by a hill, according to a plan which they had
previously arranged against the case that their camp should be
attacked. The English made short work with the underlings, but,
as they advanced, always found fresh people to keep up a
skirmish. And now the Scots, having executed a flank movement,
fell upon their assailants in a mass, from a quarter where
nothing was looked for, shouting their battle-cries with one
voice. The English were astounded, but closed up, and gave them
Percy! for Douglas! Then began a fell battle. The English, being
in excess and eager to win, beat back the Scots, who were at the
point of being worsted. James Douglas, who was young, strong, and
keen for glory, sent his banner to the front, with the cry,
Douglas! Douglas! Henry and Ralph Percy, indignant against the
earl for the loss of the pennon, turned in the direction of the
cry, responding, Percy! Knights and squires had no thought but to
fight as long as spears and axes would hold out. It was a
hand-to-hand fight; the parties were so close together that the
archers of neither could operate; neither side budged, but both
stood firm. The Scots showed extraordinary valor, for the English
were three to one; but be this said without disparagement of the
English, who have always done their duty.</p>

<p>As has been said, the English were so strong that they were
forcing their foes back, and this James Douglas saw. To regain
the ground, he took a two-handed axe, plunged into the thickest,
and opened a path before him; for there was none so well armed in
helmet or plate as not to fear his strokes. So he made his way
till he was hit by three spears, all at once, one in the
shoulder, another in the chest, another in the thigh, and borne
to the ground. The English did not know that it was Earl Douglas
that had fallen; they would have been so much elated that the day
would have been theirs. Neither did the Scots; if they had, they
would have given up in despair. Douglas could not raise himself
from the ground, for he was wounded to the death. The crush about
him was great, but his people had kept as close to him as they
could. His cousin, Sir James Lindsay, reached the spot where he
was lying, and with Lindsay Sir John and Sir Walter Sinclair, and
other knights and squires. Near him, and severely wounded, they
found his chaplain, William of North Berwick, who had kept up
with his master the whole night, axe in hand; also Sir Robert
Hart, with five wounds from lances and other weapons. Sir John
Sinclair asked the earl, Cousin, how fares it with you?
'Indifferently,' said the earl; 'praised be God, few of my
ancestors have died in their beds. Avenge me, for I count myself
dead. Walter and John Sinclair, up with my banner, and cry,
Douglas! and let neither friend nor foe know of my state.' The
two Sinclairs and Sir John Lindsay did as they were bidden,
raised the banner, and shouted, Douglas! They were far to the
front, but others, who were behind, hearing the shout loudly
repeated, charged the English with such valor as to drive them
beyond the place where Douglas now lay dead, and came up with the
banner which Sir John Lindsay was bearing, begirt and supported
by good Scots knights and squires. The Earl of Murray came up
too, and the Earl of March and Dunbar as well, and they all, as
it were, took new life when they saw that they were together and
that the English were giving ground. Once more was the combat
renewed. The English had the disadvantage of the fatigue of a
rapid march from Newcastle, by reason whereof their will was
better than their wind, whereas the Scots were fresh; and the
effects appeared in this last charge, in which the Scots drove
the English so far back that they could not recover their lost
ground. Sir Ralph Percy had already been taken prisoner. Like
Douglas, he had advanced so far as to be surrounded, and being so
badly wounded that his hose and boots were full of blood, he
surrendered to Sir John Maxwell. Henry Percy, after a valorous
fight with the Lord Montgomery, became prisoner to the Scottish
knight.</p>

<p>It was a hard battle and well fought, but such are the turns
of fortune that, although the English were the greater number,
and all bold men and practised in arms, and although they
attacked the enemy valiantly, and at first drove them back a good
distance, the Scots in the end won the day. The losses of the
English were put by their antagonists at 1040 prisoners, 1860
killed in the fight and the pursuit, and more than 1000 wounded;
those of the Scots were about 100 killed and 200 captured.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d161_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
The Scots retired without molestation, taking the way to Melrose
Abbey, where they caused the Earl of Douglas to be interred, and
his obsequies to be reverently performed. Over his body a tomb of
stone was built, and above this was raised the earl's banner.</p>

<p>Such is the story of the battle of Otterburn, fought on
Wednesday, the 19th day of August,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d161_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in the year of grace
1388, as related by Froissart (with animated tributes to the
hardihood and generosity of both parties) upon the authority of
knights and squires actually present, both English and Scots, and
also French.</p>

<p>Wyntoun,ix, 840-54, 900f (Laing, III, 36f) says that the alarm
was given the Scots by a young man that came right fast riding
(cf. <b>A</b> 20, 21, <b>B</b> 4, <b>C</b> 17), and that many of
the Scots were able to arm but imperfectly; among these Earl
James, who was occupied with getting his men into order and was
"reckless of his arming," and the Earl of Murray, who forgot his
basnet (cf. <b>C</b> 20). Earl James was slain no man knew in
what way. Bower, Scotichronicon, II, 405, agrees with Wyntoun.
English chroniclers, Knyghton, col. 2728, Walsingham (Riley, II,
176<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d161_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>), Malverne, the continuator of Higden (Polychronicon,
Lumby, IX, 185), assert that Percy killed Douglas with his own
hand, Knyghton adding that Percy also wounded the Earl of Murray
to the point of death.</p>

<p>That a Scots ballad of Otterburn was popular in the sixteenth
century appears from The Complaynte of Scotlande, 1549, where a
line is cited, The Perssee and the Mongumrye met, p. 65, ed.
Murray: cf. <b>B</b> 9<sup>1</sup>, <b>C</b> 30<sup>1</sup>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d161_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
In the following century Hume of Godscroft writes:<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d161_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The Scots
song made of Otterburn telleth the time, about Lammasse, and the
occasion, to take preyes out of England; also the dividing of the
armies betwixt the Earles of Fife and Douglas, and their severall
journeys, almost as in the authentick history. It beginneth
thus:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>It fell about the Lammas tide,<br/>
When yeomen wonne their hay,<br/>
The doughtie Douglas gan to ride,<br/>
In England to take a prey.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Motherwell maintains that the ballad which passes as English
is the Scots song altered to please the other party. His
argument, however, is far from conclusive. "That The Battle of
Otterbourne was thus dealt with by an English transcriber appears
obvious, for it studiously omits dilating on Percy's capture,
while it accurately details his combat with Douglas;" that is to
say, the ballad as we have it is just what a real English ballad
would have been, both as to what it enlarges on and what it
slights. "Whereas it would appear that in the genuine Scottish
version the capture of Percy formed a prominent incident, seeing
it is the one by which the author of The Complaynt refers to the
ballad [The Perssee and the Mongumrye met]:" from which
Motherwell was at liberty to deduce that <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>
represent the genuine Scottish version, several stanzas being
given to the capture of Percy in these; but this he would not
care to do, on account of the great inferiority of these forms. A
Scotsman could alter an English ballad "to suit political feeling
and flatter national vanity," as Motherwell says the Scots did
with Chevy Chace. (See further on, p. 303.) There is no reason to
doubt that a Scots ballad of Otterburn once existed, much better
than the two inferior, and partly suspicious, things which were
printed by Herd and Scott, and none to doubt that an English
minstrel would deal freely with any Scots ballad which he could
turn to his purpose; but then there is no evidence, positive or
probable, that this particular ballad was "adapted" from the
Scots song made of Otterburn; rather are we to infer that the few
verses of <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> which repeat or resemble the text
of <b>A</b> were borrowed from <b>A</b>, and, as likely as not,
Hume's first stanza too.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d161_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>A</b>, in the shape in which it has come down to us, must
have a date long subsequent to the battle, as the grammatical
forms show; still, what interested the borderers a hundred years
or more after the event must have interested people of the time
still more, and it would be against the nature of things that
there should not have been a ballad as early as 1400. The ballad
we have is likely to have been modernized from such a
predecessor, but I am not aware that there is anything in the
text to confirm such a supposition, unless one be pleased to make
much of the Wednesday of the eighteenth stanza. The concluding
stanza implies that Percy is dead, and he was killed at
Shrewsbury, in 1403.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. 3. Hoppertope hyll, says Percy, is a corruption for
Ottercap Hill (now Ottercaps Hill) in the parish of Kirk
Whelpington, Tynedale Ward, Northumberland. Rodclyffe Cragge (now
Rothley Crags) is a cliff near Rodeley, a small village in the
parish of Hartburn, in Morpeth Ward, south-east of Ottercap; and
Green Ley ton, corruptly Green Lynton, is another small village,
south-east of Rodeley, in the same parish. Reliques, 1794, I,
22.</p>

<p>8. Henry Percy seems to have been in his twenty-third year. As
for his having been a march-man "all his days," he is said to
have begun fighting ten years before, in 1378, and to have been
appointed Governor of Berwick and Warden of the Marches in 1385:
White, History of the Battle of Otterburn, p. 67 f. Walsingham
calls both Percy and Douglas young men, and Froissart speaks at
least twice of Douglas as young. Fraser, The Douglas Book, 1885,
I, 292, says that Douglas was probably born in 1358. White, as
above, p. 91, would make him somewhat older.</p>

<p>17. The chivalrous trait in this stanza, and that in the
characteristic passage 36-44, are peculiar to this transcendently
heroic ballad.</p>

<p>26, 27. The earldom of Menteith at the time of this battle,
says Percy, following Douglas's Peerage, was possessed by Robert
Stewart, Earl of Fife, third son of King Robert II; but the Earl
of Fife was in command of the main body and not present. (As
Douglas married a daughter of King Robert II, the Earl of Fife
was not his uncle, but his brother-in-law.) The mention of
Huntley, says Percy, shows that the ballad was not composed
before 1449; for in that year Alexander, Lord of Gordon and
Huntley, was created Earl of Huntley by King James II. The Earl
of Buchan at that time was Alexander Stewart, fourth son of the
king. Reliques, 1794, I, 36.</p>

this fight.</p>

<p>45, 46. "The ancient arms of Douglas are pretty accurately
emblazoned in the former stanza, and if the readings were, The
crowned harte, and, Above stode starres thre, it would be
minutely exact at this day. As for the Percy family, one of their
ancient badges or cognizances was a white lyon statant, and the
silver crescent continues to be used by them to this day. They
also give three luces argent for one of their quarters." Percy,
as above, p. 30.</p>

<p>48. So far as I know, St. George does not appear as Our Lady's
knight in any legendary, though he is so denominated or described
elsewhere in popular tradition. So in the spell for night-mare,

the princess whom he has rescued, says he has vowed to Mary to be
her servant.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d161_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In the corresponding Swedish ballad, of the
same age as the Danish, George is called Mary's knight (Maria
honom riddare gjorde, st. 2): Geijer and Afzelius, ed.
Bergstr&ouml;m, II, 402. This is also his relation in German
ballads: Meinert, p. 254; Ditfurth, I, 55, No 68.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d161_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>B</b>. 1, 9, 14 nearly resemble <b>A</b> 1, 50, 68, and
must have the same origin. In <b>B</b> 9 Douglas is changed to
Montgomery; in 14 Douglas is wrongly said to have been buried on
the field, instead of at Melrose Abbey, where his tomb is still
to be seen.</p>

<p>7 is founded upon a tradition reported by Hume of Godscroft:
"There are that say that he was not slain by the enemy, but by
one of his owne men, a groome of his chamber, whom he had struck
the day before with a truncheon in the ordering of the battell,
because hee saw him make somewhat slowly to; and they name this
man John Bickerton of Luffenesse, who left a part of his armour
behinde unfastned, and when hee was in the greatest conflict,
this servant of his came behinde his back and slew him thereat."
Ed. 1644, p. 105.</p>

<p>11. The summons to surrender to a brakenbush is not in the
style of fighting-men or fighting-days, and would justify
Hotspur's contempt of metre-ballad-mongers.</p>

<p>12, 13. <b>B</b> agrees with Froissart in making a Montgomery
to be the captor of Henry Percy, whereas <b>A</b> represents that
Montgomery was taken prisoner and exchanged for Percy. In The
Hunting of the Cheviot Sir Hugh Montgomery kills Percy, and in
return is shot by a Northumberland archer.</p>

<p><b>C</b>. Scott does not give a distinct account of this
version. He says that he had obtained two copies, since the
publication of the earlier edition, "from the recitation of old
persons residing at the head of Ettrick Forest, by which the
story is brought out and completed in a manner much more
correspondent to the true history." <b>C</b> is, in fact, a
combination of four copies; the two from Ettrick Forest, <b>B</b>
<b>a</b>, and the Manuscript copy used in <b>B</b> <b>b</b> to
"correct" Herd.</p>

<p>8, it scarcely requires to be said, is spurious, modern in
diction and in conception.</p>

<p>19. Perhaps derived from Hume of Godscroft rather than from
tradition. When Douglas was dying, according to this
historian,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d161_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> he made these last requests of certain of his
kinsmen: "First, that yee keep my death close both from our owne
folke and from the enemy; then, that ye suffer not my standard to
be lost or cast downe; and last, that ye avenge my death, and
bury me at Melrosse with my father. If I could hope for these
things," he added, "I should die with the greater contentment;
for long since I heard a prophesie that a dead man should winne a
field, and I hope in God it shall be I." Ed. 1644, p. 100.</p>

<p>22 must be derived from the English version. As the excellent
editor of The Ballad Minstrelsy of Scotland, Glasgow, 1871,
remarks, "no Scottish minstrel would ever have dreamt of
inventing such a termination to the combat between these two
redoubted heroes ... as much at variance with history as it is
repulsive to national feeling: " p. 431.</p>

<p>Genealogical matters, in this and the following ballad, are
treated, not always to complete satisfaction, in Bishop Percy's
notes, Reliques, 1794, I, 34 ff; Scott's Minstrelsy, 1833, I,
351, 363 ff: White's History of the Battle of Otterburn, p. 67
ff; The Ballads and Songs of Ayrshire, I, 66 f.</p>
