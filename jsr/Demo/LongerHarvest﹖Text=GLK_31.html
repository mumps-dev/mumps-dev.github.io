<h3>31. The Marriage of Sir Gawain</h3>

<p>We have here again half a ballad, in seven fragments, but the
essentials of the story, which is well known from other versions,
happen to be preserved, or may he inferred: Arthur, apparently
some day after Christmas, had been encountered at Tarn Wadling,
in the forest of Inglewood, by a bold baron armed with a club,
who offered him the choice of fighting or ransoming himself by
coming back on New Year's day and bringing word what women most
desire. Arthur puts this question in all quarters, and having
collected many answers, in which, possibly, he had little
confidence, he rides to keep his day. On the way he meets a
frightfully ugly woman; she intimates that she can help him.
Arthur promises her Gawain in marriage, if she will, and she
imparts to him the right answer. Arthur finds the baron waiting
for him at the tarn, and presents first the answers which he had
collected and written down. These are contemptuously rejected.
Arthur then says that he had met a lady on a moor, who had told
him that a woman would have her will. The baron says that the
misshapen lady on the moor was his sister, and he will burn her
if he can get hold of her. Upon Arthur's return he tells his
knights that he has a wife for one of them. When they see the
bride they decline the match in vehement terms, all but Gawain,
who is somehow led to waive "a little foul sight and misliking."
He takes her in all her repulsiveness, and she turns to a
beautiful young woman. She asks Gawain whether he will have her
in this likeness by night only or only by day. Gawain leaves the
choice to her, and this is all that is needed to keep her
perpetually beautiful. For a stepmother had bewitched her to go
on the wild moor in that fiendly shape until she should meet some
knight who would let her have all her will. Her brother, under a
like spell, was to challenge men either to fight with him at odds
or to answer his hard questions.</p>

<p>These incidents, with the variation that Arthur waits for
Gawain's consent before he promises him in marriage, are found in
a romance, probably of the fifteenth century, printed in Madden's
Syr Gawayne, and somewhat hastily pronounced by the editor to be
"unquestionably the original of the mutilated poem in the Percy
folio." Gower (Confessio Amantis, Book i, vv. 1407 ff.) and
Chaucer (Wife of Bath's Tale) both have this tale, though with a
different setting, and with the variation, beyond doubt original
in the story, that the man whose life is saved by rightly
answering the question has himself to marry the monstrous woman
in return for her prompting him. The ballad of 'The Knight and
Shepherd's Daughter' (No. 110) has much in common with The Wife
of Bath's Tale and should also be compared. The incident of a hag
turned into a beautiful woman after a man has bedded with her
occurs several times in ancient Irish story, one text being found
in the Book of Leinster, a twelfth-century manuscript. For a full
discussion of the whole cycle of tales see Maynadier, The Wife of
Bath's Tale, its Sources and Analogues, 1901.</p>
