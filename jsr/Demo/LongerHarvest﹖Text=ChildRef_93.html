<p>'Lammikin: an Old Scotch Ballad,' Aberdeen, Lewis and James
Smith, 1862, said to be edited by the Rev. Dr. John Burnett
Pratt, Episcopal minister at Cruden, Aberdeen shire, is made up
of <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, with such
alterations as seemed good to the editor, and a few interpolated
stanzas.</p>

<p>'Long Lonkin,' edited by A.O. Bell, C.E., York, 1846 (Notes
and Queries, Fourth Series, III, 93), I have not seen, but
presume it to be a compounded copy.</p>

<p>The story is told without material variation in all the
numerous versions. A mason has built a castle for a nobleman,
cannot get his pay, and therefore seeks revenge. The name given
the builder is Lamkin, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>L</b>,
<b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>U</b>; Lammikin, <b>J</b>,
<b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>; Lankin, Lonkin, <b>F</b> <b>b</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>I</b>; Lantin, <b>T</b>; Long Lankyn, or Long
Longkin, <b>P</b> <b>a</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>K</b>; Rankin, <b>D</b>,
<b>H</b>; Balankin, or Lambert Linkin, <b>B</b>; Balcanqual,
<b>R</b>. That of the nobleman is Lord Wearie, Weire, <b>A</b>,
<b>M</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>U</b> <b>b</b>; Lord Earie,
<b>N</b>; Erley, Earley, <b>J</b>; Murray, <b>I</b>; Arran,
<b>C</b>; Montgomery, <b>B</b>; Cassilis, <b>S</b>; he is lord of
Prime Castle, <b>B</b>. The lord, having occasion to leave his
family, fears mischief from the man whom he has wronged, and
enjoins his wife to keep the castle well fastened. Precautions
are taken, but never theless his enemy effects an entrance
through some aperture that has not been secured, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>R</b>,
<b>U</b> <b>b</b>, or by connivance with a nurse, <b>A</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>. Most of the servants are away. To
get at the lady, Lamkin, as we may call him, by advice of the
nurse inflicts some hurt on the babe in the cradle, stabbing it,
or "nipping" it, and its cries bring the mother down. The lady
proffers large sums of gold to save her life, but Lamkin does not
care for gold now. He gloats over his opportunity, and bids the
nurse, or a maid-servant, or even one of the daughters of the
house, to scour a silver bason to hold the lady's noble blood.
The lord has a presentiment of calamity at home, and, returning,
finds his house red with the blood of his wife and child. Lamkin
is hanged, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, or burned, <b>C</b>,
<b>H</b>, or boiled in a pot full of lead, <b>D</b>. The nurse is
burned, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, or
hanged, <b>C</b>, <b>Q</b>, or boiled in a caldron,
<b>I</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d093_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>In <b>K</b>, the oldest version, except perhaps <b>P</b>,
which is greatly inferior, Lady Betty is called down by Longkin
to see her mother's blood running, then Lady Nelly to see her
sister's blood running, Lady Jenny to see Lady Nelly's, etc. In
<b>F</b>, <b>T</b>, the mother, very unnaturally, offers Lamkin
her daughter as wife, in ransom of her own life. In <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, a servant offers her life for her lady; in <b>D</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>K</b>, a daughter for her mother.</p>

<p>Motherwell remarks, p. lxx of his Minstrelsy, note 27: "There
is a 'Lambirkyns wod' near Dupplin, in Perthshire. Can this have
got its name from the cruel mason who the ballad assures us
'lived in the wode'? If so, it must be very ancient. It is
localized, too, I believe, at Balwearie, in Fifeshire; but there
are few places where the ballad is remembered but which have also
some ancient edifice in the neighborhood reared by the hands of
Lammikin.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d093_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Indeed, it seems questionable how some Scottish
lairds could well afford to get them selves seated in the large
castles they once occupied unless they occasionally treated the
mason after the fashion adopted in this ballad." And again, at p.
291: "There can be little doubt that the epithet Linkin Mr.
Lambert acquired from the secrecy and address with which he
insinuated him into that notable strength [Prime Castle]. Indeed,
all the names of Lammerlinkin, Lammikin, Lamkin, Lankin, Linkin,
Belinkin, can easily be traced out as abbreviations of Lambert
Linkin." It might be inferred, however, from the mason's
seemingly resentful inquiry in <b>A</b> 811, <b>J</b> 3-6, Where
's the men, women, bairns, lady, that call me Lamkin? that the
view in these particular versions was that Lamkin was a sobriquet
applied in derision of the meekness with which the builder had
submitted to his injury. Linkin, it will be observed, occurs only
in <b>B</b>, and it is far more likely that Lamkin, or Lammikin,
which is found in a full dozen copies, is a simply ironical
designation for the bloody mason, the terror of countless
nurseries.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d093_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
