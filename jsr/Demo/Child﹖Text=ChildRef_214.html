<p>First published in Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, 1808 (B
b). Scott remarks that he "found it easy to collect a variety of
copies, but very difficult indeed to select from them such a
collated edition as might in any degree suit the taste of 'these
more light and giddy-paced times.'" The copy principally used was
<b>B</b> <b>a</b>. St. 12 of Scott, which suited the taste of the
last century, but does not suit with a popular ballad, is from
<b>O</b>, and also st. 13, and there are traces of <b>F</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>M</b>, but 5-7 have lines which do not occur in any
version that I have seen.</p>

<p><b>A</b> had been somewhat edited before it was communicated
to Percy; the places were, however, indicated by commas. Several
copies besides <b>O</b>, already referred to, have slight
passages that never came from the unsophisticated people; as
<b>J</b> 2, in which a page "runs with sorrow," for rhyme and
without reason, <b>L</b> 2<sup>3</sup>, and <b>L</b>
12<sup>3,4</sup>, which is manifestly taken from Logan's Braes of
Yarrow.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d214_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> <b>N</b> has been interpolated with artificial
nonsense,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d214_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and is an almost worthless copy; the last stanza
may defy competition for silliness.</p>

<p><b>M</b> 1, 3, and <b>N</b> 4, 6, 7, belong to '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_212.html">The Duke of Athole's Nurse</a>.'
So also does one half of a fragment sent by
Burns in a letter to William Tytler, Cromek's Select Scotish
Songs, 1810, II, 194-8, which, however, has two stanzas of this
ballad (P) and two of 'Rare Willie's drowned in Yarrow,' No
215.</p>

<p>The fragment in Ritson's Scotish Songs, 1794, I, lxvii, is
<b>O</b>.</p>

<p>Herd's Manuscripts, I, 36, II, 182, have the following
couplets, evidently from a piece treating the story of this
ballad:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right">&nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>O when I look east my heart is sair,<br/>
But when I look west it 's mair and mair,<br/>
For there I see the braes of Yarrow,<br/>
And there I lost for ay my marrow.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>The groups <b>A</b>-<b>I</b> and <b>J</b>-<b>P</b> are
distinguished by the circumstance, of no importance to the story,
that the hero and heroine in the former are man and wife, in the
other unmarried lovers. In all the versions (leaving out of
account the fragments <b>O</b>, <b>P</b>) the family of the woman
are at variance with the man. Her brothers think him an unfit
match for their sister, <b>A</b> 8, <b>B</b> 2.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d214_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In <b>C</b>
2 the brothers have taken offence because their sister was not
regarded as his equal by her husband, which is perhaps too much
of a refinement for ballads, and may be a perversion. She was
worth stealing in <b>C</b> as in <b>B</b>. The dispute in two or
three copies appears to take the form who is the flower, or rose,
of Yarrow, that is the best man, <b>C</b> 8, 9, 17, <b>B</b> 1,
12, <b>D</b> 1, 14; but this matter is muddled, cf. <b>C</b> 2,
3, <b>D</b> 2. We hear nothing about the unequal match in
<b>D</b>-<b>I</b>, but in <b>J</b>-<b>L</b> a young lady
displeases her father by refusing nine gentlemen in favor of a
servant-lad.</p>

<p>Men who are drinking together fall out and set a combat for
the next day, <b>B</b>-<b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>. It is three
lords that drink and quarrel in <b>B</b>-<b>D</b> (ten (?) in
<b>I</b>). The lady fears that her three brothers will slay her
husband, <b>B</b> 5, <b>C</b> 5. The lord in <b>D</b> 2 seems not
to be one of the three in <b>D</b> 1, and we are probably to
understand that three brothers get into a brawl with a man who
has surreptitiously married their sister. Only one brother is
spoken of in <b>A</b> (6), from whom treachery is looked for,
<b>E</b> 2.</p>

<p>In <b>I</b>-<b>L</b> the father makes the servant-lad fight
with the nine high-born suitors.</p>

<p>The wife tries to keep her husband at home, <b>A</b>-<b>E</b>,
I; but he is confident that all will go well, and that he shall
come back to her early, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>I</b>.
She kisses (washes) and combs him, and helps to arm him,
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>; so
<b>J</b>, <b>K</b>. He finds nine armed men awaiting him on the
braes or houms of Yarrow, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>-<b>G</b>,
<b>I</b>-<b>M</b>, ten <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d214_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> They ask if he
has come to hawk, hunt (drink), or fight; he replies that he has
come to fight, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>; cf. <b>A</b> 5, 6.
Five (four) he slays and four (five) he wounds, <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>; in
<b>F</b> he kills all the nine; in <b>L</b> he gets no further
than the seventh; in <b>G</b> he kills all but one.</p>

<p>These nine, after the way of ballads, should be the lady's
brothers, and such they are in <b>A</b> 7, 8. Three of them, but
only three, should be the lady's brothers according to <b>B</b>
1-5, <b>C</b> 1-5. Three brethren are charged by the husband with
a message to his lady in <b>D</b> 8, and these might be his
brothers-in-law. The message is sent in <b>B</b> 9 by a
good-brother, or wife's brother, John, who clearly was not in the
fight in <b>B</b>, though the husband says he is going to meet
this brother John in <b>A</b> 6. This brother-in-law of <b>B</b>
is probably intended by brother in <b>I</b> 8.</p>

<p>After the hero has successively disposed of his nine or ten
antagonists (he takes them 'man for man'), he is stabbed from
behind in a cowardly way, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>I</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>N</b>, by somebody. The tradition is much
blurred here; it is a squire out of the bush, a cowardly man, a
fause lord. An Englishman shoots him with an arrow out of a bush
in <b>D</b>. But other reports are distinct. The lady's father
runs him through (not from behind) in <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>. Her
brother springs from a bush behind and runs him through,
<b>L</b>. Her brother John comes behind him and slays him,
<b>N</b>. Up and rose her brother James and slew him, <b>M</b>.
In <b>I</b> "that stubborn knight" comes behind him and runs his
body through, and that (a) "stubborn lord" is the author of his
death in <b>G</b>, <b>F</b>. Taking <b>E</b> 2, 8, 9 together,
the stubborn knight, at least in <b>E</b>, may be interpreted as
good-brother John, whose treachery is feared in <b>E</b> 2, who
is prominent in <b>A</b> 6, and who is expressly said to slay his
sister's true-love in <b>N</b>. On the whole, the preponderance
of tradition is to the effect that the hero was treacherously
slain by his wife's (love's) brother.</p>

<p>Word of her husband's death is sent or carried to the wife by
her brother, brother John, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>L</b>,
<b>N</b>; her or his three brothers, <b>D</b> 8; her or his
brother, <b>I</b> 8; his man John, <b>C</b> 12, by mistake; her
father (?), <b>J</b>, <b>K</b>; her sister Anne, <b>F</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. The wife has had a dream that she, her lord
or true-love and she, had been pulling green heather (birk) in
Yarrow, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>-<b>F</b>, <b>I</b>-<b>M</b>,
<b>O</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d214_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The dream is explained to signify her lord's
death, and she is enjoined to fetch him home. In <b>A</b>, the
dream occurs before the fight and is double, of pulling green
heather and of her love coming headless home; in <b>B</b>, the
lady dreams that her lord was sleeping sound in Yarrow, and in
the highly vitiated <b>N</b> that 'he had lost his life.'</p>

<p>The wife hurries to Yarrow;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d214_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> up a high, high hill and down

<p>Her hair is five quarters long; she twists it round his hand
and draws him home, <b>C</b>; ties it round his middle and
carries him home, <b>D</b>. She takes three lachters of her hair,
ties them tight round his middle and carries him home, <b>B</b>.
<i>His</i> hair is five quarters long! she ties it to her horse's
mane and trails him home, <b>K</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d214_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The carrying strikes
one as unpractical, the trailing as barbarous. In <b>L</b>, after
the lover is slain, the surviving lords and her brother trail him
by the heels to Yarrow water and throw him into a whirlpool. The
lady, searching for him, sees him 'deeply drowned.' His hair,
which we must suppose to float, is five quarters long; she twines
it round her hand and draws him out. Raising no petty questions,
it appears enough to say that this is the only version of
fourteen in which the drowning occurs, and that the drowning of
the lover is the characteristic of No 215, the next following
ballad, which has otherwise been partly confused with
this.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d214_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The lady's father urges her to restrain her grief; he will wed
her with as good a lord as she has lost, or a better; she rejects
his suggestions. Her heart breaks, <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>; she dies
in her father's arms, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>-<b>H</b>,
<b>J</b>-<b>L</b>, being at the time big with child, <b>B</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>F</b>-<b>H</b>, <b>J</b>.</p>

<p>The lady tells her father to wed his sons, <b>B</b> 12; his
seven sons, <b>J</b> 18. So 'Clerk Saunders' (of which this may
be a reminiscence, for we do not hear of seven sons in this
ballad), No 69, <b>G</b> 28; cf. <b>A</b> 26, <b>B</b> 19.</p>

<p>She bids him take home his ousen and his kye, <b>E</b> 15,
<b>F</b> 12, <b>G</b> 8, <b>H</b> 9. This I conceive to be an
interpolation by a reciter who followed the tradition cited from
Hogg further on.</p>

<p>The message to the mother to come take up her son in <b>I</b>
8 may possibly be a reminiscence from '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_114.html">Johnie Cock</a>,' No 114. It
occurs in no other copy, and comes in awkwardly.</p>

<p>'The Braes of Yarrow' ('Busk ye, busk ye, my bony, bony
bride'), written by William Hamilton of Bangour "in imitation of
the ancient Scottish manner," was suggested by this
ballad.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d214_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>'The Dowy Dens,' Evans's Old Ballads, 1810, III, 342, has the
same foundation. 'The Haughs o Yarrow,' a modern piece in
Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 211, repeats with
a slight change the third stanza of <b>O</b>, and has further on
half a stanza from 'Willie's rare,' No 215.</p>

<p>James Hogg, in sending <b>E</b> <b>a</b> to Sir Walter Scott,
wrote as follows: "Tradition placeth the event on which this song
is founded very early. That the song hath been written near the
time of the transaction appears quite evident, although, like
others, by frequent sing ing the language is become adapted to an
age not so far distant. The bard does not at all relate
particulars, but only mentions some striking features of a
tragical event which everybody knew. This is observable in many
of the productions of early times; at least the secondary bards
seem to have regarded their songs as purely temporary.</p>

<p>"The hero of the ballad is said to have been of the name of
Scott, and is called a knight of great bravery. He lived in
Ettrick, some say at Oakwood, others Kirkhope; but was
treacherously slain by his brother-in-law, as related in the
ballad, who had him at ill will because his father had parted
with the half of all his goods and gear to his sister on her
marriage with such a respectable man. The name of the murderer is
said to be Annand, a name I believe merely conjectural from the
name of the place where they are said both to be buried, which at
this day is called Annan's Treat, a low muir lying to the west of
Yarrow church, where two huge tall stones are erected, below
which the least child that can walk the road will tell you the
two lords are buried that were slain in a duel."</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott, in the revised edition of his Minstrelsy,
expressed a conviction that this ballad referred to a duel fought
between John Scott of Tushielaw and his brother-in-law Walter
Scott of Thirlestane, in which the hitter was slain.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d214_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
Contemporary entries in the records of the Presbytery of Selkirk
show that John Scott, son to Walter of Tushielaw, killed Walter
Scott, brother of Sir Robert of Thirlestane, in 1609. The slain
Walter Scott was not, however, the brother-in-law of John of
Tushielaw, for his wife was a daughter of Sir Patrick Porteous. A
violent feud ensued, as might be expected, between the Scotts of
Thirlestane and of Tushielaw. Seven years later, in 1616, a
Walter Scott of Tushielaw made " an informal and inordinat
marriage with Grizel Scott of Thirlestane without consent of her
father." The record of the elopement is three months after
followed by an entry of a summons to Simeon Scott of Bonytoun (an
adherent of Thirlestane) and three other Scotts "to com pear in
Melrose to hear themselves excommunicat for the horrible
slaughter of Walter Scott" [of Tushielaw]. Disregarding the
so-called duel, we have a Walter Scott of Tushielaw carrying off
a wife from the Scotts of Thirlestane, with which family he was
at feud; and a Walter Scott of Tushielaw horribly slaughtered by
Scotts of Thirlestane. These facts correspond rather closely with
the incidents of the ballad. We do not know, to be sure, that the
two Walter Scotts of Tushielaw were the same person. There were
Walter Scotts many; but tradition is capable of confounding the
two or the three connected with this series of events. On the
other hand, there is nothing in the ballad to connect it
preferably with the Scotts; the facts are such as are likely to
have occurred often in history, and a similar story is found in
other ballads.</p>

<p>In the Scandinavian ballad 'Herr Helmer,' Helmer has married a
lady whose family are at feud with him for the unatoned slaughter
of her uncle; he meets her seven brothers, who will now hear of
no satisfaction; there is a fight; Helmer kills six, but spares
the seventh, who treacherously kills him: Afzelius, ed.
Bergstr&ouml;m, I, 264, Arwidsson, I, 155 (etc., see 11, 170 of
this collection, note J). Other forms make the last of the
brothers willing to accept an arrangement: 'Herr Helmer Blau,'

Viser, HI, 99, No 123, has also several features of our ballad.
The hero, on parting from a lady with whom he has passed the
night in a wood, is warned by her to avoid her seven brothers.
This he is too brave to do, and he meets them. They ask him where
are his hawk and his hound. He tries, unsuccessfully, to induce
them to give him their sister for wife; they fight; he kills all
the seven brothers, and is slain himself, in some way not
explained. (These ballads are translated in Prior, III, 371,
230.)</p>

<p>The next ballad has been partially confused with this.</p>

<p><b>B</b> <b>b</b>, Scott's ballad, is translated by Doenniges, p. 237; by 
Lo&egrave;ve-Veimars, p. 347. 
Knortz, Lieder und Romanzen Alt-Englands, 
p. 92, translates Allingham's ballad.</p>
