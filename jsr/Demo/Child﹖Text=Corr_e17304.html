<h3>173. Mary Hamilton</h3>


<p>Pp. 379-97. <b>I</b> <b>a</b> was first printed in the second
edition of the Minstrelsy, 1803, II, 163. (Read in 1<sup>2</sup>,
on her; in 3<sup>2,</sup> hand.) The copy principally used was
one furnished by Sharpe, which was not <b>A</b> <b>a</b>, and has
not so far been recovered. Besides this, "copies from various
quarters" were resorted to. (Half a dozen stanzas are found in
<b>G</b>, but <b>G</b> itself is very likely a compilation).
Eight copies from Abbotsford are now printed for the first time.
Two of these may have been in Scott's hands in time to be used,
two were certainly not, and for the others we have no date.</p>

<p>There is only one novel feature in all these copies: in
<b>U</b> 13 Mary's paramour is a pottinger. The remark that there
is no trace of an admixture of the Russian story with that of the
apothecary, page 383, must therefore be withdrawn.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_e17304_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Mary in
this version, as in <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>T</b>,
<b>U</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>Y</b>, is daughter of the Duke of York.</p>

<p><b>X</b>, like <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, has borrowed from No 95: see 
13-15.</p>

<p>Finlay sent Scott, March 27, 1803, the following copy of 'The
Queen's Marie,' as he "had written it down from memory:" Letters
addressed to Sir Walter Scott, I, No 87, Abbotsford. Stanzas 10,
9, 12 appear in the second volume of the Minstrelsy, 1802, p.
154, with the variation of a couple of words, as 'The Lament of
the Queen's Marie' (here <b>I</b> <b>b</b>). Perhaps Finlay
adopted these three stanzas into his copy. Stanzas 1, 3, 6, 8,
with very slight variations, were printed by Finlay in the
preface to his Scottish Ballads, 1808 (<b>O</b>).</p>
