<p>Sir Gilbert Hay, tenth Earl of Errol, was married to Lady
Catherine Carnegy, younger daughter of James, second Earl of
Southesk, January 7, 1658, and had no children by her. He died in
1674. The ballad, says the person who communicated <b>A</b>
<b>b</b> to the Edinburgh Miscellany, was "founded, it would
seem, on some attempt to withhold from the Earl of Errol his
consort's portion." It will be observed that the father proposes
a beguiling to his daughter, and that she is ready to assent, in
<b>A</b>, 12, 13.</p>

<p>It appears from a letter cited by Sharpe in his Ballad Book
that the matters treated in the ballad were agitating, and had
even "come to public hearing," in February, 1659.</p>

<p>Sir John Hay of Killour, as the nearest male heir, became the
eleventh Earl of Errol. His wife was Lady Anne Drummond, only
daughter of James, third Earl of Perth, so that the Earl of Perth
might seem to have an interest in this affair of Errol's. She,
however, was not born till January, 1656. Perth is actually made
the other party in legal proceedings in <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 1, but
in <b>A</b> <b>b</b> seems to espouse Errol's side.</p>

<p>Carnegy's other daughter, who in most of the versions censures
her sister's conduct, is called Jean in <b>A</b> 5, <b>D</b>
<b>a</b> 7, <b>F</b> 10, Anne in <b>D</b> <b>b</b> <b>c</b>.
These are stock ballad-names, and we need not suppose that Anne
comes from Lady Anne Drummond. The older daughter's name was
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Errol is in the Carse of Gowrie, a tract noted for its
fertility; which accounts for <b>B</b> 2, <b>D</b> <b>a</b> 1,
<b>D</b> <b>c</b> 1, <b>F</b> 2.</p>

<p><b>E</b>, <b>F</b> go the length of imputing to Lady Errol an
attempt to poison her husband with wine which she offers him. A
page, of Errol's kin, exposes her in <b>E</b>; in <b>F</b> Errol
gives the drink to a greyhound, and the dog bursts.</p>

<p>The last stanza of <b>A</b> <b>b</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>
<b>c</b> has reference to "the ancient separate maintenance of a
lady dissatisfied with or apart from her husband." (Edinburgh
Magazine, as above.)</p>

<p>E is introduced in Sharpe's letter by some pages of mild
pleasantry in the form of a preface to "a specimen of the fourth
volume of the Border Minstrelsy, speedily to be published."</p>
