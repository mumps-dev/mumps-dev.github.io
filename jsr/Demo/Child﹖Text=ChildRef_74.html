<p><b>A</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b> are broadside or stall
copies, <b>a</b> of the end of the seventeenth century, <b>b</b>
"modern" in Percy's time, and they differ inconsiderably, except
that <b>a</b> has corrupted an important line.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d074_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Of <b>d</b>,
Percy says, Since the first edition some improvements have been
inserted, which were communicated by a lady of the first
distinction, as she had heard this song repeated in her infancy.
Herd, in The Ancient and Modern Scots Songs, 1769, p. 295,
follows Percy. As Percy has remarked, the ballad is twice quoted
in Beaumont and Fletcher's 'Knight of the Burning Pestle,' 1611.
Stanza 5 runs thus in Act 2, Scene 8, Dyce, II, 170:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>When it was grown to dark midnight,<br/>
And all were fast asleep,<br/>
In came Margaret's grimly ghost,<br/>
And stood at William's feet.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>The first half of stanza 2 is given, in Act 3, Scene 5, Dyce,
p. 196, with more propriety than in the broadsides, thus:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>You are no love for me, Margaret,<br/>
I am no love for you.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>The fifth stanza of the ballad, as cited in 'The Knight of the
Burning Pestle,' says the editor of the Reliques, has "acquired
an importance by giving birth to one of the most beautiful
ballads in our own or any language" [that is, 'Margaret's
Ghost'], "the elegant production of David Mallet, Esq., who, in
the last edition of his poems, 3 vols, 1759, informs us that the
plan was suggested by the four verses quoted above, which he
supposed to be the beginning of some ballad now lost."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d074_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The
ballad supposed to be lost has been lately recovered, in a copy
of the date 1711, with the title 'William and Margaret, an Old
Ballad,' and turns out to be substantially the piece which Mallet
published as his own in 1724, Mallet's changes being
comparatively slight. 'William and Margaret' is simply 'Fair
Margaret and Sweet William' rewritten in what used to be called
an elegant style. Nine of the seventeen stanzas are taken up with
a rhetorical address of Margaret to false William, who then
leaves his bed, raving, stretches himself on Margaret's grave,
thrice calls her name, thrice weeps full sore, and dies. See The
Roxburghe Ballads, in the Ballad Society's reprint, III, 671,
with Mr. Chappell's remarks there, and in the Antiquary, January,
1880. The ballad of 1711 seems to have been founded upon some
copy of the popular form earlier than any we now possess, or than
any known to me, for the last half of stanza 5 runs nearly as it
occurs in Beaumont and Fletcher (see also <b>B</b> 7), thus:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>In glided Margaret's grimly ghost,<br/>
And stood at William's feet.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>'Fair Margaret and Sweet William' begins like '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_73.html">Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</a>,'
and from the fifth stanza on is blended with a form
of that ballad represented by versions <b>E</b>-<b>H</b>. The
brown girl, characteristic of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_73.html">Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</a>,' has
slipped into <b>A</b> 14, 15, <b>B</b> 8, of 'Fair Margaret and
Sweet William.' The catastrophe of 'Fair Margaret and Sweet
William' is repeated in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_75.html">Lord Lovel</a>,' and it will be convenient
to notice under the head of the latter, which immediately
follows, some ballads out of English which resemble both,
especially in the conclusion.</p>
