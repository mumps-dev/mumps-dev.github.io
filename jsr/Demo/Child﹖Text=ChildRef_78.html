<p>The vow in the second stanza of all the copies is such as we
find in 'Bonny Bee-Ho'm,' and elsewhere (see p. 156 f of this
volume), and <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b> 4, 5, <b>C</b> 3, 4 are
nearly a repetition of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_77.html">Sweet William's Ghost</a>,' <b>A</b> 5, 6,
<b>B</b> 3, 4, <b>C</b> 7, 8, <b>D</b> 7, 10. This may suggest a
suspicion that this brief little piece is an aggregation of
scraps. But these repetitions would not strike so much if the
ballad were longer, and we must suppose that we have it only in
an imperfect form. Even such as it is, however, this fragment has
a character of its own. It exhibits the universal popular belief
that excessive grieving for the dead interferes with their
repose. We have all but had 'The Unquiet Grave' before, as the
conclusion of two versions of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_49.html">The Twa Brothers</a>:'</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott has remarked that the belief that excessive
grieving over lost friends destroyed their peace was general
throughout Scotland: Redgauntlet, Note 2 to Letter XI. See also
Gregor's Notes on the Folk-Lore of the North-East of Scotland, p.
69. We have recent testimony that this belief survives in England
(1868), Folk Lore Record, I, 60. It was held in Ireland that
inordinate tears would pierce a hole in the dead: Killinger,
Erin, VI, 65, 449 (quoting a writer that I have not
identified).</p>

<p>The common notion is that tears wet the shroud or
grave-clothes. Scott relates a story of a Highlander who was
constrained to come back and say to a kinswoman: My rest is
disturbed by your unnecessary lamentation; your tears scald me in
my shroud.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant of Laggan tells a similar story. An only sister had
lost an only brother. Night after night she sat up, weeping
incessantly arid calling upon his name. At length her brother
appeared to her in his shroud, and seemed wet and shivering.
"Why," said he, "am I disturbed with the extravagance of thy
sorrow? Till thou art humble and penitent for this rebellion
against the decrees of Providence, every tear thou sheddest falls
on this dark shroud without drying, and every night thy tears
still more chill and encumber me." Essays on the Superstitions of
the Highlanders of Scotland, ed. New York, 1813, p. 95 f.</p>

<p>A dead boy appears to his mother, and begs her to cease
weeping, for all her tears fall upon his shirt and wet it so that
he cannot sleep. The mother gives heed, her child comes again and
says, Now my shirt is dry, and I have peace. Grimms, K. u. H.
m&auml;rchen, No 109.</p>

<p>In another form of this tradition a child has to carry all its
mother's tears in a large pitcher, and cannot keep up with a
happy little band to which it would belong, 'Die Macht der
Thr&auml;nen,' Erk, Neue Sammlung, III, I, No 35 = Wunderhorn,
IV, 95, Liederhort, p. 8, No 3, Mittler, No 557; Hoffmann u.
Richter, p. 341, No 290; B&ouml;rner, Volkssagen aus dem Orlagau,
pp 142, 152; or lags behind because its clothes are heavy with
these tears, Geiler von Kaisersberg's Trostspiegel, 1510, cited
by Rochholz in Wolf's Zeitschrift fur deutsche Mythologie, II,
252; Thomas Cantipratensis, Bonum Universale, "1. ii, c. 53,
&#167; 17," about 1250; or the child collects its mother's tears
in its hands, M&uuml;llenhoff, No 196.</p>

<p>A wife's tears wet her dead husband's shirt in the German
ballad 'Der Vorwirth:' Meinert, p. 13 = Erk's Wunderhorn, IV, 96,
Erk's Liederhort, p. 160, No 46<sup>a</sup> Mittler, No 555;
Hoffmann in Deutsches Museum, 1852, II, 161 = Wunderhorn, IV, 98,
Liederhort, p. 158, No 46, Mittler, No 556; Peter, I, 200, No
15.</p>

<p>Saint Johannes Eleemosynarius and a couple of his bishops are
fain to rise from their graves because their stoles are wet
through with a woman's tears, Legenda Aurea, c. 27, 12,
Gr&auml;sse, p. 132, last half of the thirteenth century (cited
by Liebrecht); and Saint Vicelin, because his robes are drenched
with the tears of his friend Eppo, Helmold, Chronica Slavorum, 1.
i, 78, p. 15, ed. Lappenberg, last half of the twelfth century
(cited by Mullenhoff).</p>

<p>Sigr&uacute;n weeps bitter tears for Helgi's death every night
ere she sleeps. The hero comes out of his mound to comfort her,
but also to tell her how she discommodes him. He is otherwise
well off, but every drop pierces, cold and bloody, to his breast:
Helgakvi&eth;a Hundingsbana II, 45. So in some of the ballads
which apparently derive from this lay, the tears of Else or
Kerstin fill her lover's coffin with blood: Grundtvig, II, 495,
497, No 90, <b>A</b> 17, <b>B</b> 8; Afzelius, I, 31, No 6, st.
14, Wigstr&ouml;m, Folkdiktning, I, 18, st. 9.</p>

<p>Almost the very words of the Highland apparition in Scott's
tale are used by an Indian sage to a king who is inconsolable for
the loss of his wife; "the incessant tears of kinsfolk burn the
dead, so it is said:" K&acirc;lid&acirc;sas, Raghuvansa, VIII,
85, ed. Stenzler, p. 61 of his translation. Another
representation is that the dead have to swallow the rheum and
tears of their mourning relations, and therefore weeping must be
abstained from: Y&acirc;jnavalkya's Gesetzbuch, Sanskrit u.
Deutsch, Stenzler, III, 11, p. 89.</p>

<p>The ancient Persians also held that immoderate grief on the
part of survivors was detrimental to the happiness of the dead.
Weeping for the departed is forbidden, because the water so shed
forms an impediment before the bridge Tch&icirc;navar (over which
souls pass to heaven). Sad-der, Porta XCVII, Hyde, Veterum
Persarum et Parthorum Religionis Historia, p. 486, ed. Oxford,
1700. Again, Ardai Viraf, seeing a deep and fetid river, which is
carrying away a multitude of souls in all the agony of drowning,
and asking what this is, is told: The river that you see before
you is composed of the tears of mankind, tears shed, against the
express command of the Almighty, for the departed; therefore,
when you return again to the earth inculcate this to mankind,
that to grieve immoderately is in the sight of God a most heinous
sin; and the river is constantly increased by this folly, every
tear making the poor wretches who float on it more distant from
ease and relief. The Ardai Viraf Nameh, translated from the
Persian, by J.A. Pope, London, 1816, p. 53 f.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d078_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The Greeks and Romans also reprehend obstinate condolement as
troubling the dead, and perhaps, if we had the popular views on
the subject, these might be found to have taken an expression
like some of the above. In Lucian De Luctu, c. 16, the ghost of a
son who had died in the bloom of youth is made to reproach the
disconsolate father in these words: &#8038;
&#954;&#945;&#954;&#8057;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;
&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#949;, &#964;&#8055;

&#948;&#8051; &#956;&#959;&#953;
&#960;&#945;&#961;&#8051;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#962;
&#960;&#961;&#8049;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d078_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>
