<p>This ballad and the two which follow it are clearly not of the 
same rise, and not meant for the same ears, as those which go 
before. They would come down by professional rather than by 
domestic tradition, through minstrels rather than knitters and 
weavers. They suit the hall better than the bower, the tavern or 
public square better than the cottage, and would not go to the 
spinning wheel at all. An exceedingly good piece of  minstrelsy 
'The Boy and the Mantle' is, too; much livelier than most of the 
numerous variations on the somewhat overhandled theme.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Of these, as nearest related, the fabliau or "romance" of Le 
Mantel Mautailli&eacute;, 'Cort Mantel,' must be put first: 
Montaiglon et Raynaud, Recueil G&eacute;n&eacute;ral des 
Fabliaux, III, 1, from four manuscripts, three of the thirteenth 
century, one of the fourteenth; and previously by Michel, from 
the three older manuscripts, in Wolf, Ueber die Lais, p. 324. A 
rendering of the fabliau in prose, existing in a single 
manuscript, was several times printed in the sixteenth century: 
given in Legrand, ed. Renouard, I, 126, and before, somewhat 
modernized, by Caylus, 'Les Manteaux,' &OElig;uvres Badines, VI, 
425.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The story in 'Cort Mantel' goes thus. Arthur was holding full
court at Pentecost, never more splendidly. Not only kings, dukes,
and counts were there, but the attendance of all young bachelors
had been commanded, and he that had a <i>bele amie</i> was to
bring ber. The court assembled on Saturday, and on Sunday all the
world went to church. After service the gueen took the ladies to
her apartments, till dinner should be ready. But it was Arthur's
wont not to dine that day until he had had or heard-of some
adventure;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> dinner was kept waiting; and it was therefore with
great
<a name="Page_I_258"/>
satisfaction that the knights saw a handsome and courteous
varlet arrive, who must certainly bring news; news that was not
to be good to all, though some would be pleased (cf. stanza 5 of
the ballad). A maid had sent him from a very distant country to
ask a boon of the king. He was not to name the boon or the lady
till he had the king's promise; but what he asked was no harm.
The king having said that be would grant what was asked, the
varlet took from a bag a beautiful mantle, of fairy workmanship.
This mantle would fit no dame or damsel who had in any way
misbehaved towards husband or lover; it would be too short or too
long; and the boon was that the king should require all the
ladies of the court to put it on.</p>

<p>The ladies were still waiting dinner, unconscious of what was
coming. Gawain was sent to require their presence, and he simply
told them that the magnificent mantle was to be given to the one
it best fitted. The king repeated the assurance, and the queen,
who wished much to win the mantle, was the first to try it on. It
proved too short. Ywain sug-gested that a young lady who stood
near the queen should try. This she readily did, and what was
short before was shorter still. Kay, who had been making his
comments unguardedly, now divulged the secret, and after that
nobody cared to have to do with the mantle. The king said, We may
as well give it back; but the varlet insisted on having the
king's promise. There was general consternation and bad humor.</p>

<p>Kay called his mistress, and very confidently urged her to put
on the mantle. She demurred, on the ground that she might give
offence by forwardness; but this roused suspicion in Kay, and she
had no resource but to go on. The mantle was again lamentably
short. Bruns and Ydier let loose some gibes. Kay bade them wait;
he bad hopes for them. Gawain's <i>amie</i> next underwent the
test, then Ywain's, then Perceval's. Still a sad disappointment.
Many were the curses on the mantle that would fit nobody, and on
him that brought it. Kay takes the unlucky ladies, one after the
other, to sit with bis mistress.</p>

<p>At this juncture Kay proposes that they shall have dinner, and
continue the experiment by and by. The varlet is relentless; but
Kay has the pleasure of seeing Ydier discomfited. And so they go
on through whole court, till the varlet says that he fears he
shall be obliged to carry his mantle away with him. But first let
the chambers be searched; some one may be in hiding who may save
the credit of the court. The king orders a search, and they find
one lady, not in hiding, but in her bed, because she is not well.
Being told that she must come, she presents herself as soon as
she can dress, greatly to the vexation of her lover, whose name
is Carados Briebras. The varlet explains to her the quality of
the mantle, and Carados, in verses very bonorable to his heart,
begs that she will not put it on if she has any misgivings.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
The lady says very meekly that she dare not boast being better
than other people, but, if it so please her lord, she will
willingly don the mantle. This she does, and in sight of all the
barons it is neither too short nor too long. "It was well we sent
for her," says the varlet. "Lady, your lover ought to be
deligbted. I have carried this mantle many courts, and of more
than a thousand who have put it on you are the only one that bas
escaped disgrace. I give it to you, and well you deserve it." The
king confirms the gift, and no one can gainsay.</p>

<p>A Norse prose translation of the French fabliau was executed
by order of the Norwegian king, H&aacute;kon H&aacute;konarson,
whose reign covers the years 1217-63. Of this translatiopn,
"M&ouml;ttuls Saga,' a fragment has come down which is as old as
1300; there are also portions of a manuscript which is assigned
to about 1400, and two transcripts of this latter, made when it
was complete, besides other less
<a name="Page_I_259"/>
important copies. This
translation, which is reasonably close and was made from a good
exemplar, has been most excellently edited by Messrs.
Cederschi&ouml;ld and Wulff, Versions nordiques du Fabliau Le
Mantel Mautailli&eacute;, Lund, 1877, p. 1.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It presents no
divergences from the story as just given which are material
here.</p>

<p>Not so with the 'Skikkju R&iacute;mur,' or Mantle Rhymes, an
Icelandic composition of the fifteenth century, in three parts,
embracing in all one hundred and eighty-five four-line stanzas:
Cederschi&ouml;ld and Wulff, p. 51. In these the story is told
with additions, which occur partially in our ballad. The mantle
is of white velvet. Three elf-women had been not less than
fifteen years in weaving it, and it seemed both yellow and gray,
green and black, red and blue: II, 22, 23, 26. Our English
minstrel describes these variations of color occurring after
Guenever had put the mantle on: stanzas 11, 12. Again, there are
among the Pentecostal guests a king and queen of Dwarf Land; a
beardless king of Small-Maids Land, with a queen eight years old;
and a King Felix, three hundred years old, with a beard to the
crotch, and a wife, tall and fat, to whom he has been two
centuries married, &mdash; all these severally attended by
generous retinues of pigmies, juveniles, and seniors: I, 28-35;
III, 41. Felix is of course the prototype of the old knight
pattering over a creed in stanzas 21-24 of the ballad, and he
will have his representative in several other pieces presently to
be spoken of. In the end Arthur sends all the ladies from his
court in disgrace, and his knights to the wars; we will get
better wives, he says: III, 74, 75.</p>

<p>The land of Small-Maids and the long-lived race are mentioned
in a brief geographical chapter (the thirteenth) of that singular
gallimaufry the saga of Samson the Fair, but not in connection
with a probation by the mantle, though this saga has appropriated
portions of the story. Here the mantle is one which four fairies
have worked at for eighteen years, as a penalty for stealing from
the fleece of a very remarkable ram; and it is of this same
fleece, described as being of all hues, gold silk, <i>ok
kolors</i>, that the mantle is woven. It would hold off from an
unchaste woman and fall off from a thief. Quintalin, to ransom
his life, undertakes to get the mantle for Samson. Its virtue is
tried at two weddings, the second being Samson's; and on this last
occasion Valentina, Samson's bride, is the only woman who can put
it on. The mantle is given to Valentina, as in the fabliau to
Carados's wife, but nevertheless we hear later of its being
presented by Samson to another lady, who, a good while after, was
robbed of the same by a pirate, and the mantle carried to Africa.
From Africa it was sent to our Arthur by a lady named Elida, "and
hence the saga of the mantle."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Bj&ouml;rner, Nordiska
K&auml;mpa Dater, cc 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24.</p>

<p>There is also an incomplete German version of the fabliau, now
credibly shown to be the work of Heimich von dem T&uuml;rlin,
dating from the earliest years of the thirteenth century.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
Though the author has dealt freely with his original, there are
indications that
<a name="Page_I_260"/>
this, like the M&ouml;ttulssaga, was founded
upon some version of the fabliau which is not now extant. One of
these is an agreement between vv 574-6 and the sixth stanza of
our ballad. The mantle, in English, is enclosed between two
nut-shells;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in German, the bag from which it is taken is
hardly a span wide. In the M&ouml;ttulssaga, p. 9, l. 6, the
mantle comes from a p&uacute;ss, a small bag hanging on the belt;
in Ulrich von Zatzikboven's Lanzelet, from ein m&aelig;zigez
teschel&icirc;n, and in the latter case the mantle
instantaneously expands to full size (Warnatsch); it is also of
all colors known to man, vv 5807-19. Again, when Guenever had put
on the mantle, st. 10 of our balllad, "it was from the top to the
toe as sheeres had itt shread." So in 'Der Man-tel,' vv 732,
733:</p>

<p>Unde [= untenJ het man in zerizzen,<br/>
Oder mit mezzern zesnitten.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The Lanzelet of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven, dating from the first
years of the thirteenth century, with peculiarities of detail and
a partially new set of names, presents the outline of the same
story. A sea-fairy sends a maid to Arthur with a magnificent
gift, which is, however, conditioned upon his granting a boon.
Arthur assents, and the maid takes, from a small bag which she
wears at her girdle, a mantle, which is of all colors that man
ever saw or heard of, and is worked with every manner of beast,
fowl, and strange fish. The king's promise obliges him to make
all the court ladies don the mantle, she to have it whom it
perfectly fits. More than two hundred try, and there is no
absolute fit.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> But Iblis, Lanzelet's wife, is not present:
she is languishing on account of his absence on a dangerous
adventure. She is sent for, and by general agreement the mantle
is, on her, the best-fitting garment woman ever wore. Ed. Hahn, vv
5746-6135.</p>

<p>The adventure of the Mantle is very briefly reported to
Gawain, when on his way with Ydain to Arthur, by a youth who had
just come from the court, in terms entirely according with the
French fabliau, in Messire Gauvain, ou La Vengeance de Raguidel,
by the trouv&egrave;re Raoul, ed. Hippeau, p. 135 ff, 3906-55,
and in the Dutch Lancelot, ed. Jonckbloet, Part II, p. 85, vv
12,500-527, poems of the thirteenth century. the one lady whom
the mantle fits is in the latter
<a name="Page_I_261"/>
Carados vrindinne, in the other
l'amie Caraduel Briefbras.</p>

<p>The Scalachronica, by Sir Thomas Gray of Heton, a chronicle of
England and Scotland, 1066-1362, begun in 1355, gives the
analysis of many romances, and that of the adventure of the
Mantle in this form. There was sent to Arthur's court the mantle
of Karodes, which was of such virtue that it would fit no woman
who was not willing that her husband should know both her act and
her thought.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This was the occasion of much mirth, for the
mantle was either too short, or too long, or too tight, for all
the ladies except Karodes' wife. And it was said that this mantle
was sent by the father of Karodes, a magician, to prove the
goodness of his son's wife.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Two fifteenth-century German versions of the mantle story give
it a shape of their own. In Fastnachtspiele aus dem
f&uuml;nfzehnten Jahrhundert II, 665, No 81, 'Der Luneten
Mantel,' the amiable Lunet, so well and favorably known in
romances, takes the place of the English boy and French varlet.
The story has the usual course. The mantle is unsuccessfully
tried by Arthur's queen, by the wife of the Greek emperor, and by
the queen of Lorraine. The king of Spain, who announces himself
as <i>the oldest man</i> present, is willing to excuse his wife,
who is the youngest of the royal ladies. She says, If we lack
lands and gold, "so sei wir doch an eren reich," offers herself
to the test with the fearlessness of innocence, and comes off
clear, to the delight of her aged spouse. A meistergesang, Bruns,
Beitr&auml;ge zur kritischen Bearbeitung alter Handschriften, p.
143,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> 'Lanethen Mantel,' again awards the prize to the young
wife of a very old knight. Laneth, a clean maid, who is Arthur's
niece, having made herself poor by her bounty, is cast off by her
uncle's wife and accused of loose behavior. She makes her trouble
known to a dwarf, a good friend of her father's, and receives
from him a mantle to take to Arthur's court: if anybody huffs her,
she is to put it to use. the queen opens upon Laneth, as soon as
she appears, with language not unlike that which she employs of
Cradock's wife in stanzas 33, 34 of the ballad. The mantle is
offered to any lady that it will fit. In front it comes to the
queen's knee, and it drags on the ground behind. Three hundred
and fifty knights' ladies fare as ill as the sovereign.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The Dean of Lismore's collection of Gaelic poetry, made in the
early part of the sixteenth century, contains a ballad, obscure
in places, but clearly presenting the outlines of the Engish
ballad or French fabliay.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Finn, Diarmaid, and four other
heroes are drinking, with their six wives. The women take too
much, and fall to boasting of their chastity. While they are so
engaged, a maid approaches who is clad in a seamless robe of pure
white. She sits down by Finn, and he asks her what is the virtue
of the garment. She replies that her seamless robe will
completely cover none but the spotless wife. Conan, a sort of
Kay, says, Give it to my wife at once, that we may learn the
truth of what they have been saying.
<a name="Page_I_262"/>
The robe shrinks into folds,
and Conan is so angry that he seizes his spear and kills his
wife.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_016','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Diarmaid's wife tries, and the robe clings about her
hair; Oscar's, and it does not reach to her middle; Maighinis,
Finn's wife, and it folds around her ears. MacRea's wife only is
completely covered. The 'daughter of Deirg,' certainly a wife of
Finn, and here seemingly to be identified with Maighinis, claims
the robe: she has done nothing to be ashamed of; she has erred
only with Finn. Finn curses her and womankind, "because of her
who came that day."</p>

<p>The probation by the Horn runs parallel with that by the
Mantle, with which it is combined in the English ballad. Whether
this or that is the anterior creation it is not possible to say,
though the 'Lai du Corn' is, beyond question, as Ferdinand Wolf
held, of a more original stamp, fresher and more in the popular
vein than the fabliau of the Mantle, as we have it.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_017','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The
'Lai du Corn,' preserved in a single not very early manuscript
(Digby 86, Bodleian Library "of the second half of the thirteenth
or beginning of the fourteenth century"), may well belong, where
Wolf puts it, in the middle of the twelfth. Robert Bikez, the
jongleur who composed it, attributes the first authorship to
"Garadue," the hero, and says that he himself derived the story
from the oral communication of an abb&eacute;. Arthur has
assembled thirty thousand knights at a feast at Pentecost, and
each of them is paired with a lady. Before dinner there arrives a
donzel, with an ivory horn adorned with four gold bands and rich
jewels. This horn has been sent Arthur by Mangounz, king of
Moraine. The youth is told to take his place before the king, who
promises to knight him after dinner and give him a handsome
present the next day; but he laughingly excuses himself, on the
ground that it is not proper for a squire to eat at a knight's
table, and retires. Arthur sees that there is an inscription on
the horn, and desires that his "chapelein" may read it. Everybody
is eager to hear, but some repent afterwards. The horn was made
by a fairy. who endued it with this quality, that no man should
drink of it without spilling, if his wife had not been true in
act and thought. Even the queen hung her head, and so did all the
barons that had wives. the maids jested, and looked at their
lovers with "Now we shall see." Arthur was offended, but ordered
Kay to fill. The king drank and spilled; seized a knife, and was
about to strike the queen, but was withheld by his knights.
Gawain gallantly came to the queen's vindication. "Be not such a
churl," he said, "for there is no married woman but has her
foolish thought." The queen demanded an ordeal by fire: if a hair
of her were burned, she would be torn by horses. She confessed
that the horn was in so far right that she had once given a ring
to a youth who had killed a giant that had accused Gawain of
treason, etc. She thought this youth would be a desirable
addition to the court. Arthur was not convinced: be would make
everybody try the horn now, king, duke. and count, for he would
not be the only one to be shamed. Eleven kings, thirty counts,
all who essay, spill: they are very angry, and bid the devil take
him who brought and him who sent the horn. When Arthur saw this,
he began to laugh: he regarded the horn as a great present, he
said, and he would part with it to nobody except the man that
could drink out of it. The queen blushed so prettily that he
kissed her three times, and asked her pardon for his bad humor.
The queen said, Let everybody
<a name="Page_I_263"/>
take the horn, small and great.
There was a knight who was the happiest man in all the court, the
least a braggart, the most mannerly, and the most redoubtable
after Gawain. His name was Garadue, and he had a wife, <i>mout
leal</i>, who was a fairy for beauty, and surpassed by none but
the queen. Garadue looked at her. She did not change color.
"Drink," she said; "indeed, you are at fault to hesitate." She
would never have husband but him: for a woman should be a dove,
and accept no second mate. Garadue was naturaJly very much
pleased: he sprang to his feet, took the horn, and, crying
Wassail! to the king, drank out every drop. Arthur presented him
with Cirencester, and, for his wife's sake, with the horn, which
was exhibited there on great days.</p>

<p>The romance of Perceval le Gallois, by Chrestien de Troyes and
others (second half of the twelfth century), describes Arthur,
like the fabliau, as putting off dinner till he should hear of
some strange news or adventure. A knight rides into the hall,
with an ivory horn, gold-banded and richly jewelled, hanging from
his neck, and presents it to the king. Have it filled with pure
water, says the bearer, and the water will turn to the best wine
in the world, enough for all who are present. "A rich present!"
exclaims Kay. But no knight whose wife or love has be-trayed him
shall drink without spilling. "Or empire vostre pr&eacute;sens,"
says Kay. The king has the born filled, and does not heed
Guenever, who begs him not to drink, for it is some enchantment,
to shame honest folk. "Then I pray God," says the queen, "that if
you try to drink you may be wet." The king essays to drink, and
Guenever has her prayer. Kay has the same luck, and all the
knights,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_018','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> till the horn comes to Carados
(Brisi&eacute;-Bras). Carados, as in the lai, hesitates; his wife
(Guinon, Guimer) looks at him, and says, Drink! He spills not a
drop. Guenever and many a dame hate nothing so much as her.

<p>The story of 'Le Livre de Carados,' in Perceval, is given in
abridgment by the author of Le Roman du Renard contrefait,
writing in the second half of the fourteenth century:
Tarb&eacute;, Po&egrave;tes de Champagne ant&eacute;rieurs au
siecle de Fran&ccedil;ois I<sup>er</sup>, Histoire de Quarados
Brun-Bras, p. 79 ff. The horn here becomes a cup.</p>

<p>A meistergesang, entitkd 'Dis ist Frauw Tristerat Horn von
Saphoien,' and found in the same fifteenth-century manuscript as
Der Lanethen Mantel, Bruns, as before, p. 139, preserves many
features of the lai. While Arthur is at table with seven other
kings and their wives, a damsel comes, bringing an ivory horn,
with gold letters about the rim, a present from Frau Tristerat of
Savoy. The king sends for a clerk to read the inscription, and
declares he will begin the experiment. The damsel prudently
retires. Arthur is thorougbly wet, and on the point of striking
the queen, but is prevented by a knight. The seven kings then
take the born, one after the other. Six of them fare like Arthur.
The king of Spain looks a his wife, fearing shame. She encourages
him to drink, saying, as in the other meistergesang, If we are
poor in goods, we are rich in honor. Arthur presents him with the
horn, and adds cities and lands. Another copy of this piece was
printed by Zingerle, in Germania, V, 101, 'Das goldene Horn.' The
queen is aus der Syrenen lant.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_020','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A fastnachtspiel gives substantially the same form to the
story: Keller, Nachlese, No 127, p. 183. Arthur invites seven
kings and queens to his court. His wife wisbes him to ask his
sister, the Queen of Cyprus, also; but she has offended him, and
he cannot be prevailed upon to do it. The Queen of Cyprus sends
the horn to Arthur by her maid as a gift
<a name="Page_I_264"/>
from a queen who is to
be nameless, and in fulfilling her charge the messenger describes
her lady simply as a sea princess. The inscription is read aloud
by one of Arthur's knights. The King of Spain carries off the
honors, and receives in gift, besides the horn, a ducal crown,
and gold to boot. Arthur resolves that the horn shall be
forgotten, and no grudge borne against the women, and proposes a
dance, which he leads off with his wife.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_021','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>We have Arthur joining in a dance under nearly the same
circumstances in an English "bowrd" found in a manuscript of
about the middle of the fifteenth century (Ashmolean Museum, No
61). The king has a bugle horn, which always stands before him,
and often amuses himself by experimenting with it. Those who
cannot drink without spilling are set at a table by themselves,
with willow garlands on their heads, and served with the best.
Upon the occasion of a visit from the Duke of Gloucester, the
king, wishing to entertain his guest with an exhibition of the
property of the horn, says he will try all who are present. He
begins himself, as he was wont to do, but this time spills. He
takes the mishap merrily, and says he may now join in a dance
which the "freyry" were to have after meat. 'The Cokwolds Daunce,'

<p>Heinrich von dem T&uuml;rlin narrates the episode of the
probation by the Horn with many variations of his own, among them
the important one of subjecting the women to the test as well as
the men.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_023','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> In his Cr&ocirc;ne, put at 1200-10, a misshapen,
dwarfish knight, whose skin is overgrown with scales, riding on a
monster who is fish before and dolphin behind, with wings on its
legs, presents himself to Arthur on Christmas Day as an envoy
from a sea king, who offers the British monarch a gift on
condition of his first granting a boon. The gift is a cup, made
by a necromancer of Toledo, of which no man or woman can drink
who has been false to love, and it is to be the king's if there
shall be anybody at the court who can stand the test. The ladies
are sent for, and the messenger gives the cup first to them. They
all spill. The knights follow, Arthur first; and he, to the
general astonishment, bears the proof, which no one else does
except the sea king's messenger. Caraduz<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_024','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> von Caz fails with

<p>The prose Tristan confines the proof to the women, and
transfers the scene to King Mark's court. Morgan the Fay having
sent the enchanted horn to Arthur's court by the hands of a
damsel, to avenge herself on Guenever, two knights who had a
spite against Mark and Tristan intercept it, and cause the horn
to be taken to King Mark, who is informed that no lady that has
been false to her lord can drink of it without spilling. Yseult

spills, and the king says she deserves to die. But, fortunately or
unfortunately, all the rest of the ladies save four are found to
be in the same plight as the queen. The courtiers, resolved to
make the best of a bad matter, declare that they have no
confidence in the probation, and the king consents to treat the
horn as a deception, and acquits his wife.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_025','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>In a piece in the Wunderhorn, I, 389, ed. 1819, called 'Die
Ausgleichung,' and purporting to be from oral tradition, but
reading like an imitation, or at most a reconstruction, of a
meistergesang, the cup and mantle are made to operate conjointly:
the former to convict a king and his knights, the other a queen
and her ladies, of unfaithfulness in love. Only the youngest of
the ladies can wear the mantle, and only the oldest of the
knights, to whom she is espoused, can drink from the cup. This
knight, on being presented with the cup, turns into a dwarf; the
lady, on receiving the gift of the mantle, into a fay. They pour
a drop of wine from the cup upon the mantle, and give the mantle
to the queen, and the cup, empty to the king. After this, the
king and all the world can drink without inconvenience, and the
mantle fits every woman. But the stain on the mantle grows bigger
every year, and the cup gives out a hollow sound like tin! An
allegory, we may suppose, and, so far as it is intelligible, of
the weakest sort.</p>

<p>Tegau Eurvron is spoken of in Welsh triads as one of the three
chaste ladies, and again as one of the three fair ladies, of
Arthur's court.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_027','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> She is called the wife of Caradawe
Vreichvras by various Welsh writers, and by her surname of
"Gold-breasted" she should be so.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_028','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> If we may trust the
author of The Welsh Bards, Tegau was the possessor of three
treasures or rarities "which befitted none but herself," a
mantle, a goblet, and a knife. The mantle is mentioned in a
triad,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_029','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and is referred to as having the variable hue
attributed to it in our ballad and elsewhere. There are three
things, says the triad, of which no man knows the color; the
peacock's expanded tail, the mantle of Tegau Eurvron, and the
miser's pence. Of this mantle, Jones, in whose list of "Thirteen
Rarities of Kingly Regalia" of the Island of Britain it stands
eleventh, says, No one could put it on who had dishonored
marriage, nor a young damsel who had committed incontinence; but
it would cover a chaste
<a name="Page_I_266"/>
woman from top to toe: Welsh Bards, II,
49. The mantle certainly seems to be identified by what is said
of its color in the (not very ancient) triad, and so must have
the property attributed to it by Jones, but one would be glad to
have had Jones cite cbapter and verse for his description.</p>

<p>There is a drinking-horn among the Thirteen Precious Things of
the Island of Britain, which, like the conjurer's bottle of our
day, will furnish any liquor that is called for, and a knife
which will serve four-and-twenty men at meat "all at once." How
this horn and this knife should befit none but the chaste and
lovely Tegau, it is not easy to comprehend. Meanwhile the horn
and the knife are not the property of Cradock's wife, in the
English ballad: the horn falls to Cradock of right, and the knife
was his from the beginning. Instead of Tegau's mantle we have in
another account a mantle of Arthur, which is the familiar cloak
that allows the wearer to see everything without himself being
seen. Not much light, therefore, but rather considerable mist,
comes from these Welsh traditions, of very uncertain date and
significance. It may be that somebody who had heard of the three
Welsh rarities, and of the mantle and horn as being two of them,
supposed that the knife must have similar virtues with the horn
and mantle, whence its appearance in our ballad; but no proof has
yet been given that the Welsh horn and knife had ever a power of
testing chastity.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_030','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Heinrich von dem T&uuml;rlin, not satisfied with testing
Arthur's court first with the mantle, and again with the horn,
renews the experiment with a Glove, in a couple of thousand lines
more of tedious imitation of 'Cort Mantel,'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_031','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Cr&ocirc;ne,
22,990-24,719. This glove renders the right side of the body
invisible, when put on by man or woman free of blame, but leaves
in the other case some portion of that side visible and bare. A
great many ladies and knights don the glove, and all have reason
to regret the trial except Arthur and Gawain.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_032','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>There is another German imitation of the fabliau of the
mantle, in the form (1) of a farce of the fifteenth century and
(2) of a meistergesang printed in the sixteenth. In these there
is substituted for the mantle a Crown that exposes the infidelity
of husbands.</p>

<p>1. "Das Vasnachtspil mit der Kron."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_033','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A "master" has been
sent to Arthur's court with a rich crown, which the King of Abian
wishes to present to whichever king or lord it shall fit, and it
will fit only those who have not "lost their honor." The King of
Orient begins the trial, very much against his will: the crown
turns to ram's horns. The King of Cyprus is obliged to follow,
though he says the devil is in the crown: the crown hangs about
his neck. Appeals are made to Arthur that the trial may now stop,
so that the knights may devote themselves to the object for which
they had come together, the service and honor of the ladies, But
here Lanet, Arthur's sister (so she is styled), interposes, and
expresses a hope that no honors are intended the queen,
<a name="Page_I_267"/>
for she
is not worthy of them, having broken her faith. Arthur is very
angry, and says that Lanet has by her injurious language
forfeited all her lands, and shall be expelled from court. (Cf.
Der Lanethen Mantel, p. 261.) A knight begs the king to desist,
for he who heeds every tale that is told of his wife shall never
be easy.</p>

<p>2. The meistergesang 'Die Krone der K&ouml;nigin von
Afion.'"<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_034','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> While his majesty of Afion is holding a great
feast, a youth enters the hall bearing a splendid crown, which
has such chaste things in it that no king can wear it who haunts
false love. The crown had been secretly made by order of the
queen. The king wishes to buy the crown at any price, but the
youth informs him that it is to be given free to the man who can
wear it. The king asks the favor of being the first to try the
crown: when put on his head it falls down to his back. The King
of Portugal is eager to be next: the crown falls upon his
shoulder. The King of Holland at first refuses to put on the
crown, for there was magic in it, and it was only meant to shame
them: but he is obliged to yield, and the crown goes to his
girdle. The King of Cyprus offers himself to the adventure: the
crown falls to his loins. And so with eleven. But there was a
"Young Philips," King of England, who thought he might carry off
the prize. His wife was gray and old and ugly, and quite willing,
on this account, to overlook e bisserle Falschheit, and told him
that he might spare himself. But he would not be prevented; so
they put the crown on him, and it fitted to a hair. This makes an
edifying pendant to 'Der Luneten Mantel,' p. 261.</p>

<p>Still another imitation is the Magical Bridge in the younger
Titurel which Klingsor throws over the Sibra. Knights and ladies
assembled at Arthur's court, if less than perfect<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_035','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> on
attempting to ride over it are thrown off into the water, or

magician: ed. Keller, Historia, K&ouml;nig Artus mit der
ehbrecher-brugk, II, 262; Goedeke, Dichtungen von Hans Sachs, I,
175. Kirchhof follows Hans Sachs in a story in Wendunmuth, ed.
&Ouml;sterley, II, 38.</p>

<p>Florimel's Girdle, in the fourth book of the 'Fairy Queen,'
canto V, once more, is formed on the same pattern.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_036','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>There might be further included in imitations of the horn or
mantle test several other inventions which are clearly, as to
form, modelled on this original, but which have a different
object: the valley from which no false lover could escape till it
had been entered by one "qui de nulle chose auroit vers s'amie

<p>A <b>picture</b>. For the rose, as in Perceforest,
<a name="Page_I_269"/>
there is
substituted, in a story otherwise essentially the same, a
picture. A knight, compelled to leave his wife, receives from a
ma-gician a picture of her, small enough to carry in a box about
his person, which will turn yellow if she is tempted, pale if she
wavers, black if she yields, but will otherwise preserve its
fresh hues: Bandello, Part I, nov. 21. This tale, translated in
Painter's Palace of Pleasure, 1567 (ed. Haslewood, II, 471, nov.
28), furnished the plot for Massinger's 'Picture,' 1630. The
miniature will keep its color as long as the woman is innocent and
unattempted, will grow yellow if she is solicited but
unconquered, and black if she surrenders: Act I, Scene 1.
Bandello's story is also the foundation of S&eacute;nec&eacute;'s
tale, 'Filer le parfait amour,' with a wax image taking the place
of the picture: &OElig;uvres Choisies, ed. Charles et Cap, p.
95.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_041','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A <b>ring</b>. the picture is exchanged for a ring in a French
tale derived, and in parts almost translated, from Bandello's:
the sixth in 'Les Faveurs et les Disgraces de l'Amour,' etc.,
said to have appeared in 1696.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_042','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A white stone set in the
ring may become yellow or black under circumstances. Such a ring
Rimnild gave Horn Child: when the stone should grow wan, her
thoughts would have changed; should it grow red, she is no more a
maid: see p. 192. A father, being required to leave three
daughters, gives them each such a ring in Basile, Pentamerone,
III, 4. The rings are changed into glass distaffs in 'L'Adroite
Princesse,' an imitation of this story by Mlle. Lh&eacute;ritier
de Villaudon, which has sometimes been printed with Perrault's
tales: Perrault, Contes des F&eacute;es, ed. Giraud, p. 239;
Dunlop, cb. 13.</p>

<p>A <b>mirror</b>, in the History of Prince Zeyn Alasnam,
reflecting the image of a chaste maid, will remain unblurred:
Arabian Nights, Scott, IV, 120, 124; 1001 Nacht, Habicht, VI,
146, 150; etc. Virgil made a mirror of like property; it exposed
the woman that was "new-fangle," wandelm&uuml;etic, by the
ignition of a "worm" in the glass: Meisterlieder der Kolmarer
Handschrift, Bartsch, p. 605 (Warnatsch). There is also one of
these mirrors in Primaleon, I. ii, cap. 27; Rajna, Le Fonti dell'
Orlando Furioso, p. 504, note 3. Alfred de Musset, in
'Barberine,' substitutes a pocket-mirror for the picture in
Bandello, Part I, nov. 21: &OElig;uvres Compl&egrave;tes, III,
378 ff.</p>

<p>A <b>harp</b>, in the hands of an image, upon the approach of
a <i>despucell&eacute;e</i>, plays out of tune and breaks a
string: Perceval le Gallois, II, 149, vy 13,365-72 (Rajna, as
above).</p>

<p>A <b>crystal brook</b>, in the amiral's garden in Flor and
Blancheflor, when crossed by a virgin remains pellucid, but in
the other case becomes red, or turbid: ed. Du M&eacute;ril, p.
75, vv 1811-14; Bekker, Berlin Academy, XLIV, 26, vv 2069-72;
Fleck, ed. Sommer, p. 148, vv 4472-82; Swedisb, ed. Klemming, p.

Middle Greek, Bekker, Berlin Academy, 1845, p. 165, Wagner,
Medi&aelig;val Greek Texts, p. 40 f, vv 1339-48; etc. In the
English poem, Hartshorne's Ancient Metrical Tales, p. 93, if a
clean maid wash her hands in the water, it remains quiet and
clear; but if one who has lost her purity do this, the water will
yell like mad and become red as blood.</p>

<p>The <b>stone</b> Aptor, in Wigamur, vv 1100-21, is red to the
sight of clean man or woman, but misty to others: Von der Hagen
und B&uuml;sching, Deutsche Gedichte des Mittelalters, p. 12

<p>A <b>statue</b>, in an Italian ballad, moved its eyes when
young women who had sacrificed their honor were presented to it:
Ferraro,
<a name="Page_I_270"/>
Canti popolari di Ferrara, Cento e Pontelagoscuro, p.
84, 'Il Conte Cagnolino.' There was said to be a statue of Venus
in Constantinople which could not be approached by an incontinent
woman without a very shameful exposure; and again, a pillar
surmounted by four horns, which turned round three times if any
&#954;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#7939;&#962; came up to it.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_044','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
Virgil, 'Filius,' made a brass statue which no misbehaving woman
might touch, and a vicious one received violent blows from it:
Meisterlieder der Kolmarer Handschrift, Bartsch, p. 604, 14th
century. This statue would bite off the fingers of an adulteress
if they were put in its mouth, according to a poem of the same
century published by Bartsch in Germania, IV, 237; and a third
version makes the statue do this to <i>all</i> perjurers,
agreeing in other respects with the second: Kolmarer
Meisterlieder, as before, p. 338. In the two last the offence of
the wife causes a horn to grow out of the husband's forehead.
Much of the story in these poems is derived from the fifteenth
tale of the Shukasaptati, where a woman offers to pass between
the legs of a statue of a Yaksha, which only an innocent one can
do: Benfey, Pantschatantra, I, 457.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_045','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>According to a popular belief in Austria, says J. Grimm, you
may know a clean maid by her being able to blowout a candle with
one puff and to light it again with another. The phrase was known
in Spain: "Matar un candil con un soplo y encenderlo con otro."
Grimm adds that it is an article of popular faith in India that a
virgin can make a ball of water, or carry water in a sieve:
Rechtsalterth&uuml;mer, p. 932.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_046','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>An ordeal for chastity is a feature in several of the Greek
romances. In Heliodorus's &AElig;thiopica, X, 8, 9, victims to be
offered to the sun and moon, who must be pure, are obliged to
mount a brazier covered with a golden grating. The soles of those
who are less than perfect are burned. Theagenes and Chariclea
experience no inconvenience. The Clitophon and Leucippe of
Achilles Tatius, VIII, 6, 13, 14, has a <b>cave</b> in the grove
of Diana of Ephesus, in which they shut up a woman. If it is a
virgin, a delicious melody is presently heard from a syrinx, the
doors open of themselves, and the woman comes out crowned with
pine leaves; if not a virgin, a wail is heard, and the woman is
never seen again. There is also a not perfectly convincing trial,
by the Stygian water, in &#167; 12, which seems to be imitated in
the Hysmine and Hysminias of Eustathius [EumathiusJ, VIII, 7, XI,
17. In the temple of Diana, at Artycomis, stands a statue of the
goddess, with bow in hand, and from about her feet flows water
like a roaring river. A woman, crowned with laurel, being put in,
she will float quietly, if all is right; but should she not have
kept her allegiance to Dian, the goddess bends her bow as if to
shoot at her head, which causes the culprit to duck, and the
water carries off her wreath.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_047','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>It is prescribed in Numbers v, 11-31, that any man jealous of
his wife may bring her to the priest, who shall, with and after
various ceremonies, give her a bitter drink of holy water in
which dust from the floor of the tabernacle has been infused. If
she have trespassed, her body shall swell and rot. In the
Pseudo-Matthew's Gospel, ch. xii, Joseph and Mary successively
take this aquam potationis domini. No pretender to innocence
could taste this and then make seven turns round the altar,
without some sign of sin appearing in the face. The experiment
sbows both to be faultless. So, with some variation, the
sixteenth chapter of the Protevangelium of James. This trial is
the subject of one of the Coventry Mysteries, No 14, p, 137 ff,
ed. Halliwell, and no doubt of other scripture plays. It is
naturally introduced into Wernher's Maria, Hoffmann, Fundgruben,
II, 188, line 26 ff, and probably into other lives of the
Virgin.</p>

<p>Herodotus relates, II, 111, that Pheron, son of Sesostris,
after a blindness of ten years' duration, received an intimation
from all oracle that he would recover his sight upon following a
certain prescription, such as we are assured is still thought
well of in Egypt in cases of ophthalmia. For this the
co&ouml;peration of a chaste woman was indispensable. Repeatedly
balked, the king finally regained his vision, and collecting in a
town many women of whom he had vainly hoped aid, in which number
his queen was included, he set fire to the place and burned both
it and them, and then married the woman to whom he was so much
indebted. (First cited in the Gentleman's Magazine, 1795, vol.
65, I, 114.) The coincidence with foregoing tales is certainly
curious, but to all appearance accidental.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d029_048','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The 'Boy and the Mantle' was printed "verbatim" from his
manuscript by Percy in the Reliques, III, 3, ed. 1765. The copy at
p. 314 is of course the same "revised and altered" by Percy, but
has been sometimes mistaken for an independent one.</p>
