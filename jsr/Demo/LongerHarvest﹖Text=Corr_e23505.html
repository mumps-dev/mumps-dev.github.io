<p>P. 311 b, omit the paragraph beginning <b>J</b>, and say:</p>

<p>Charles, first Earl of Aboyne, married for his first wife
Margaret Irvine of Drum, who died in December, 1662. (The Records
of Aboyne, edited by the Marquis of Huntly, New Spalding Club,
1894, p. 552.) The story of the ballad, so far as is known, is an
absolute fiction.</p>

<p>In vol. ii of <i>Retours</i> or Services of Heirs, No 4906
(Aberdeen), 17 June, 1665, there is the entry: Domina Anna
Gordoun, h&aelig;res Domin&aelig; Margaret&aelig; Irving,
spons&aelig; Comitis de Aboyne matris. (Mr. Walker of
Aberdeen.)</p>
