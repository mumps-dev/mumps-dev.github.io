<p>Diamond (Daisy, Dysmal, Dysie), only daughter of a great king,
is with child by a very bonny kitchen-boy. The base-born paramour
is put to death, and, by the king's order, his heart is taken to
the princess in a cup of gold. She washes it with the tears which
run into the cup, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and dies of her
grief. Her father has a sharp remorse, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>; his
daughter's shame looks pardonable, when he considers the beauty
of the man he has slain, <b>A</b>.</p>

<p><b>B</b> is blended with 'Willie o Winsbury,' No 100; cf.
<b>B</b> 4-9, and No 100, <b>A</b> 2-7, <b>B</b> 1-5, etc. In
'Willie o Winsbury ', <b>B</b>, the princess's name is Dysmill.
<b>A</b> 12, <b>B</b> 11 of 'Lady Diamond' also recall 'Willie o
Winsbury.'</p>

<p>In <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, the kitchen-boy is smothered between
two feather-beds.</p>

<p>Isbel was the princess's name in a copy obtained by
Motherwell, but not preserved. Mother well's Note-Book, p. 7;
C.K. Sharpe's Correspondence, II, 328.</p>

<p>The ballad is one of a large number of repetitions of
Boccaccio's tale of Guiscardo and Ghismonda, Decamerone, IV, 1.
This tale was translated in Painter's Palace of Pleasure, 1566
(ed. Jacobs, I, 180), and became the foundation of various
English poems and plays.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d269_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Very probably it was circulated in
a chap-book edition in Great Britain, as it was in Germany
(Simrock, Volksb&uuml;cher, VI, 153).</p>

<p>Prince Tancredi has an only daughter (cf. <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, 1), whose name is Ghismonda (Diamond, <b>C</b>, Dysmal,
<b>B</b>, Dysie, <b>D</b>, Daisy, <b>A</b>). She has a secret
amour with a young man of inferior condition (valetto, di nazione
assai umile; giovane di vilissima condizione, says Tancredi),
sunk in the ballad to the rank of kitchen-boy. This young man,
Guiscardo, is, however, distinguished for manners and fine
qualities; indeed, superior in these to all the nobles of the
court. In the ballad he is a very bonny boy (preferred to dukes
and earls, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>). Guiscardo is strangled (or
suffocated); the bonny boy is smothered between two feather-beds
in <b>B</b> 8, <b>C</b> 7. The bonny boy's heart is cut out and
sent to the king's daughter in a cup of gold, in the ballad; she
washes it with the tears that run from her eyes into the cup.
Ghismonda, receiving Guiscardo's heart in a gold cup, sheds a
torrent of tears over it, pours a decoction of poisonous herbs
into the cup (ove il cuore era da molte delle sue lagrime
lavato), and drinks all off, then lies down on her bed and awaits
her death. Tancredi, repenting too late of his cruelty, has the
pair buried with honors in one tomb.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d269_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p><b>Italian</b>. <b>A</b>. 'Il padre crudele,' Widter und Wolf,
Volkslieder aus Venetian, p. 72, No 93. A king has an only
daughter, Germonia. She has twelve servants to wait upon her, and
other twelve to take her to school, and she falls in love with
the handsomest, Rizzardo. They talk together, and this is
reported to the king by Rizzardo's fellow-servants. The king
shuts Rizzardo up in a room, bandages his eyes, cuts his heart
out, puts it in a gold basin, and carries it to his daughter.
'Take this basin,' he says; 'take this fine mess, Rizzardo's
heart is in it.' Germonia reproaches him for his cruelty; he
tells her, if he has done her an offence, to take a knife and do
him another. She does not care to do this; however, if he were
abed, she would. In a variant, she goes out to a meadow, and
'poisons herself with her own hands.'</p>

<p><b>B</b>. 'Flavia,' Sabatini, Saggio di Canti popolari romani,
in Rivista di Letteratura popolare, Rome, 1877, p. 17 f., and
separately, 1878, p. 8 f. Flavia has thirteen servants, and
becomes enamored of one of these, Ggism&oacute;nno. His fellows
find out that the pair have been communing, and inform the king.
'S&aacute;gra cor&oacute;na ' orders them to take
Ggism&oacute;nno to prison, and put him to death. They seat him
in a chair of gold, and dig out his heart, lay the heart in a
basin of gold, and carry it to Flavia, sitting at table, saying,
Here is a mess for you. She retires to her chamber, lies down on
her bed, and drinks a cup of poison.</p>

<p><b>C</b>. 'Risguardo belo e Rismonda bela,' Bernoni,
Tradizioni pop. veneziane, p. 39. A count has an only daughter,
Rismonda. She has twelve servants, and falls in love with the
handsomest, who waits at table, the handsome Risguardo. She asks
him to be her lover; he cannot, for if her father should come to
know of such a thing he would put him to death in prison. The
knowledge comes to the father, and Risguardo is put into prison.
One of his fellows looks him up after a fortnight, and after a
month cuts out his heart, and takes it to Rismonda; 'here is a
fine dish, the heart of Risguardo.' Rismonda, who is sitting at
table, goes to her chamber; her father comes to console her; she
bids him leave her. If I have done you wrong, he says, take this
sword and run it through me. She is not disposed to do this; she
will write three letters and die.</p>

<p>All these come from the Decameron, iv, 1. The lover is sunk to
a serving-man, as in the Scottish ballad. The names are fairly
well preserved in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>; in B the lover gets his
name from the princess, and she is provided with one from the
general stock.</p>

<p><b>Swedish</b>. 'Hertig Fr&ouml;jdenborg och Fr&ouml;ken
Adelin,' broadside, 48 stanzas, Stockholm, 1757; Afzelius, I, 95,
No 19, ed. Bergstr&ouml;m och H&ouml;ijer, I, 81, No 18, 47 sts;
Lagus, Nyl&auml;ndska Folkvisor, I, 30, No 8 a, 47 sts; Djurklou,
Ur Nerikes Folkspr&auml;k, p. 96, 22 sts; Dybeck, Runa, 1869, p.
34, 37 sts, of which only 8 are given; Lagus, as above, b, 2 sts,
c, 1 st.; Aminson, Bidrag, I, 1st heft, p. 31, No 6, 2d heft, p.
16, 1 st. each; unprinted fragments, noted by Olrik, Danmarks
gamle Folkeviser, V, II, 216 f. The broadside is certainly the
source or basis of all the printed copies, and probably of an
unpublished fragment of twenty-eight stanzas obtained by Eva
Wigstr&ouml;m in 1882 (Olrik); some trifling variations are
attributable to editing or to tradition.</p>

<p>Adelin is in the garden, making a rose chaplet for
Fr&ouml;jdeuborg, who, seeing her from his window, goes to her
and expresses the wish that she were his love. Adelin begs him
not to talk so; she fears that her father may overhear. False
maid-servants tell the king that Fr&ouml;jdenborg is decoying his
daughter; the king orders him to be put in chains and shut up in
the dark tower. There he stays fifteen years. Adelin goes to the
garden to make Fr&ouml;jdenborg a garland again. The king sees
from his window what she is about, orders her into his presence
(he has not cared to see her for fifteen years), and angrily
demands what she has been doing in the garden. She says that she
has been making a rose garland for Fr&ouml;jdenborg. 'Not
forgotten him yet?' 'No; nor should I, if I lived a hundred
years.' 'Then I will put a stop to this love.' Fr&ouml;jdenborg
is taken out of the tower; his hair and beard are gray, but he
declares that the fifteen years have seemed to him only a few
days. They bind Fr&ouml;jdenborg to a tree, and kill him as boors
slaughter cattle. They lay him on a board, and gut (slit) him as
boors gut (slit) a fish. The false maids take his heart and dress
the lady a dainty dish. She has a misgiving, and asks what she
has eaten. They tell her it is her lover's heart; then, she says,
it shall be my last meal. She asks for drink: she will drink to
Fr&ouml;jdenborg, she will drink herself dead. Her heart breaks;
word is carried to her father; God a mercy! he cries, I have
betrayed my only child. The two are buried in one grave, from
which springs a linden; the linden grows over the church ridge;
one leaf enfolds the other.</p>

<p><b>Danish</b>. 'Hertug Frydenborg,' in about forty copies from
recent tradition and a broadside of the eighteenth century, but
not found in old manuscripts: Olrik, Danmarks gamle Folkeviser,
V, II, 216, No 305, <b>H</b>-<b>A</b>, and Kristensen, XI, 117,
No 46. Of these, <b>E</b> <b>i</b>, obtained in 1809, had been
printed by Nyerup og Rasmussen, Udvalg af danske Viser, II, 238,
No 71. Others are in Kristensen's Skattegraveren, I, 33, No 113,
III, 148, Nos 835-38, and in Kristensen's Jyske Folkeminder, II,
207, No 61 A-D ('Ridderens Hj&aelig;rte'), and X, 213, 385, 360,
No 52 <b>A</b>-<b>E</b>, No 94 B.</p>

<p>One half of these texts, as Olrik remarks, are of Swedish
origin, and even derived from the Swedish broadside; others have
marks of their own, and one in particular, which indicates the
ultimate source of the story in both the Swedish and the Danish
ballad. This source appears to be the Decameron, IV, 1, as in the
Scottish and Italian ballads. The points of resemblance are: A
princess, an only daughter, has a lover; her father disapproves,
and throws the lover into prison (where he remains fifteen years
in the ballad, only a day or two in the tale). The lover is taken
from prison and put to death, and his heart is cut out. (The
heart is not sent to the princess in a golden vessel, as in the
Decameron, IV, 1, and the Scottish and Italian ballads, but is
cooked, and given her to eat, and is eaten; and she says, when
informed that she has eaten her lover's heart, that it shall be
her last food.) In most of the Scandinavian ballads the princess
calls for wine (mead), and 'drinks herself to death.' But in
<b>C</b> it is expressly said that she drinks poisoned wine, in
<b>E</b> <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>k</b>, poisonous wine, in
<b>D</b> that she puts a grain of poison in the cruse. (In
<b>E</b> 1 they mix the lover's blood in wine; she takes two
draughts, and her heart bursts.)</p>

<p>A husband giving his wife her lover's heart to eat is a
feature in an extensive series of poems and tales, sufficiently
represented for present purposes by the ninth tale in the fourth
day of the Decameron, and no further explanation is required of
the admixture in the Scandinavian ballad.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d269_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>In Danish <b>A</b> <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>h</b>, <b>o</b>,

lovers, and embrace or grow together. In <b>E</b> <b>k</b>, 1,
<b>F</b> <b>b</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>f</b>, and Kristensen, XI, No 46,
the lovers are buried apart (she south, he north, of kirk, etc.),
a lily springs from each, and the two grow together.</p>

<p>A youth, <b>B</b> 2, has watched a winter-long night, brought
thereto by a fair maid, <b>A</b> 1, 3, <b>B</b> 1, to whom he has
devoted his heart and thoughts, and with whom he wishes to make
off, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. Ill news comes to the maid, <b>B</b> 2,
that her lover is a prisoner, and has been thrown into a tower.
There Brennenberg (<b>A</b>, der Bremberger, <b>B</b>,
Brandenborch, <b>C</b>, der Brandenburger, <b>D</b> <b>a</b>) lay
seven years or more, till his head was white and his beard was
gray. They laid him on a table and slit him like a fish,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d269_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> cut
out his heart, dressed it with pepper, and gave it to the
fairest, <b>A</b>, the dame, <b>B</b>, the dearest, <b>C</b>, to
eat. 'What have I eaten that tasted so good?' 'Brennenberg's
heart,' <b>A</b>. 'If it is his heart, pour wine for me, and give
me to drink.' She set the beaker to her mouth, and drank it to
the bottom, <b>B</b>. The first drop she drank, her heart broke
into a dozen bits, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>. (Their love was pure, such
as no one could forbid, <b>A</b> 11; the same implied in <b>A</b>
12, <b>C</b> 5.)</p>

<p>The German-Dutch ballad, though printed two hundred years
before any known copy of the Swedish-Danish, is much less
explicit. The lady is certainly a maid in <b>B</b>, and she is a
maid in <b>A</b> if the first stanza is accepted as belonging to
the ballad. Then it should be her father who proceeds so cruelly
against her. The wine-drinking, followed by speedy death, may
come, as it almost certainly does in some of the Scandinavian
ballads, from the story of Ghismonda; and therefore the
German-Dutch ballads, as they stand, may perhaps be treated as a
blending of the first and the ninth tale of Boccaccio's fourth
day. But there is a German meisterlied, printed, like <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b> <b>a</b>, in the sixteenth century, which has
close relation with these ballads, and much more of Boccaccio's
ninth tale in it: 'Von dem Brembergers end und tod,' von der
Hagen's Minnesinger, IV, 281, Wunderhorn, 1808, II, 229,
epitomized in the Grimms' Deutsche Sagen, II, 211, No 500. The
knight Bremberger has loved another man's wife. The husband cuts
off his head, and gives his heart to the lady to eat. He asks her
if she can tell what she has eaten. She would be glad to know, it
tasted so good. She is told that it is Bremberger's heart. She
says she will take a drink upon it, and never eat or drink more.
The lady hastens from table to her chamber, grieves over
Bremberger's fate, protesting that they had never been too
intimate, starves herself, and dies the eleventh day. The husband
suffers great pangs for having 'betrayed' her and her deserving
servant, and sticks a knife into his heart.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d269_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The incident of a husband giving his wife her lover's heart to
eat occurs in a considerable number of tales and poems in
literature, and in all is obviously of the same source.</p>

<p>Ysolt, in the romance of Tristan, twelfth century, sings a lai
how Guirun was slain for love of a lady, and his heart given by
the count to his wife to eat. (Michel, III, 39, vv. 781-90.)</p>

<p>Ramon de Castel Rossillon (Raimons de Rosillon) cut off the
head of Guillems de Cabestaing, lover of his wife, Seremonda
(Margarita), took the heart from the body, 'fetz lo raustir e far
pebrada,' and gave it to his wife to eat. He then told her what
she had been eating (showing her Cabestaing's head), and asked
her if it was good. So good, she said, that she would never eat
or drink more; hearing which, her husband rushed at her with his
sword, and she fled to a balcony, let herself fall (threw herself
from a window), and was killed. (Chabaneau, Les Biographies des
Troubadours en langue proven&ccedil;ale, pp. 99-103, Manuscripts
of the thirteenth and the fourteenth century.) Nearly the same
story, 'secondo che raccontano i provenzali,' in the Decameron,
IV, 9, of Messer Guiglielmo Rossiglione and Messer Guiglielmo
Guardastagno. The lady says that she liked very much the dish
which she had eaten, and the husband, No wonder that you should
like when it was dead the thing which you liked best of all when
it was living: what you have eaten was Guardastagno's heart. God
forbid, replies the lady, that I should swallow anything else
after so noble a repast; then lets herself drop from a high
window.</p>

<p>In Konrad von W&uuml;rzburg, 'Das Herz,' 'Das Herzm&auml;re,'
1260-70, five or six hundred verses, a knight and a lady are
inflamed with a mutual passion (tugendhafter mann, reines weib).
The lady's husband conceives that he may break this up by taking
her to the Holy Land. In that case, the knight proposes to
follow; but the lady prevails upon him to go before her husband
shall take this step, with the object of lulling his jealousy and
stopping the world's talk. The knight goes, and dies of the
separation. As his end was approaching, he had ordered his
attendant to take out his heart, embalm it, enclose it in a gold
box, and carry it to the lady. The husband lights upon the
emissary, takes away the box, directs his cook to make a choice
dish of the heart, and has this set before his wife for her
exclusive enjoyment. He asks her how she finds it, and she
declares that she has never eaten anything so delicious. She is
then told that she has eaten the knight's heart, sent her by him
as a token. God defend, she exclaims, that any ordinary food
should pass my mouth after so precious victual, and thereupon
dies (von der Hagen's Gesammtabenteuer, I, 225). The same story
is introduced as an "example" in a sermon-book: 'Quidam miles
tutpiter adamavit uxorem alterius militis.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d269_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The lady kills

<p>Again, in a romance of eight thousand verses, of the
Ch&acirc;telain de Couci and la Dame de Faiel (of the end of the
thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth century), with the
difference that the ch&acirc;telain takes the cross, is wounded
with a poisoned arrow, and dies on his way to France. (Jakemon
Sakesep, Roman du Ch&acirc;telain de Couci, etc., ed. Crapelet,
1829.) From this romance was derived The Knight of Curtesy and
the Fair Lady of Faguell (in which the lady is chaste to her lord
as is the turtle upon the tree), five hundred verses, Ritson's
Metrical Romance&euml;s, III, 193, from an edition by William
Copland, "before 1568;" also a chap-book, curiously adapted to
its time, 'The Constant but Unhappy Lovers,' London, 1707 (cited
by Clouston, Popular Tales and Fictions, II, 191).</p>

<p>Descending to tradition of the present time, we find in the
adventures of R&aacute;j&aacute; Ras&aacute;lu, as told in verse
and prose in the north of India, surprising agreements with
Boccaccio's tale: <b>a</b>. Temple's Legends of the Panj&acirc;b,
I, 64 f., 1883. <b>b</b>. The same, III, 240 f., 1886. <b>c</b>.
Swynnerton in the Folk-Lore Journal, I, 143 ff., 1883, and in The
Adventures of R&aacute;j&aacute; Ras&aacute;lu, 1884, pp. 130-35.
<b>d</b>. Clouston, Popular Tales and Fictions, II, 192, from a
book privately printed, 1851. R&aacute;j&aacute; Ras&aacute;lu
kills his wife's lover, tears out his heart, <b>a</b>, heart and
liver, <b>d</b>, takes of his flesh, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, roasts
and gives to his wife to eat. She finds the meat is very good,
<b>a</b>, no venison was ever so dainty, <b>c</b>. The king
retorts, You enjoyed him when he was living; why should you not
relish his flesh now that he is dead? and shows her the body of
his rival. She leaps from the palace wall and is killed (<b>c</b>
only). (R&aacute;j&aacute; Ras&aacute;lu is assigned to our
second century.)</p>

<p>A Danish ballad in Syv's collection, 1695, has one half of the
story. A king has a man for whom his wife has a fancy chopped up
and cooked and served to the queen. She does not eat.
('Livsvandet,' Grundtvig, II, 504, No 94 A, Prior, I, 391.)</p>

<p>Very like the Indian and the Proven&ccedil;al sage, but with
change of the parts of husband and wife, is what Mme. d'Aulnoy
relates as having been enacted in the Astorga family, in Spain,
in the seventeenth century. The Marchioness of Astorga kills a
beautiful girl of whom her husband is enamored, tears out her
heart, and gives it to her husband in a stew. She asks him if the
dish was to his taste, and he says, Yes. No wonder, says the
wife, for it was the heart of the mistress whom you loved so
much; and then produces the gory head. (M&eacute;moires de la
Cour d'Espagne, La Haye, 1691, I, 108.)</p>

<p>Going back to the twelfth century, we come, even at that early
date, upon one of those extravagances, not to say travesties,
which are apt to follow successful strokes of invention. Ignaure
loves and is loved by twelve dames. The husbands serve his heart
to their twelve wives, who, when they are apprised of what has
passed, duly vow that they will never eat again after the
precious mess which they have enjoyed. (Lai d'Ignaur&egrave;s,
ed. Monmerqu&eacute; et Michel.) There are relics of a similar
story in Proven&ccedil;al and in German, and a burlesque tale to
the same effect was popular in Italy: Le Cento Novelle Antiche,
of about 1300, Biagi, Le Novelle Antiche, 1880, p. 38, No
29.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d269_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A kitchen-boy plays a part of some consequence in several
other ballads. A kitchen-boy is the hero of No 252, IV, 400, a
very poor ballad, to be sure. There is a bad tell-tale of a
kitchen-boy in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_65.html">Lady Maisry</a>,' <b>A</b>, No 65, II, 114, and there
is a high-minded kitchen-boy in 'The Lady Isabella's
Tragedy.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d269_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> 'A ballett, The Kitchen-boyes Songe' (whatever
this may be), is entered as licensed to John Aide in the
Stationers' Registers, 1570-71, Arber, I, 438. In about half of
the versions of 'Der grausame Bruder' (see II, 101 f.), the king
of England presents himself as a k&uuml;chenjuug to the brother
of a lady whom he asks in marriage after a clandestine
intimacy.</p>
