<h3>The Bonny Hind</h3>

<a name="Page_I_444"/>
<ol type="A">
<li>'The Bonny Hyn,' Herd's Manuscripts, I, 224;
II, fol. 65, fol. 83. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d05001.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>This piece is transcribed three times in Herd's manuscripts,
with a note prefixed in each instance that it was copied from the
mouth of a milkmaid in 1771. An endorsement to the same effect on
the last transcript gives the date as 1787, no doubt by mistake.
Scott had only Manuscript I in his hands, which accidentally
omits two stanzas (13, 14), and he printed this defective copy
with the omission of still another (4): Minstrelsy, II. 298, ed.
1802; III, 309, ed. 1833. Motherwell supplies these omitted
stanzas, almost in Herd's very words, in the Introduction to his
collection, p. lxxxiv, note 99. He remarks, p. 189, that tales of
this kind abound in the traditionary poetry of Scotland. The two
ballads which follow, Nos 51, 52, are of the same general
description.</p>

<p>In the first half of the story 'The Bonny Hind' comes very
near to the fine Scandinavian ballad of 'Margaret,' as yet
known to be preserved only in F&auml;r&ouml;e and Icelandic. The
conclusions differ altogether. Margaret in the F&auml;r&ouml;e ballad,
'Margretu kv&aelig;&eth;i,' F&aelig;r&ouml;iske Kv&aelig;der, Hammershaimb, No 18, is the
only daughter of the Norwegian king Magnus, and has been put in a
convent. After two or three months she longs to see her father's
house again. On her way thither she is assaulted by a young noble
with extreme violence: to whom she says,</p>

<td>Now you  have torn off all my clothes, and done me sin and shame,<br/>
I beg you, before God most high, tell me what is your name.</td></tr>

<p>Magnus, he answers, is his father, and Gertrude his mother, and
he himself is Olaf, and was brought up in the woods. By this she
recognizes that he is her own brother. Olaf
<a name="Page_I_445"/>
begs her to go back
to the convent, and say nothing, bearing her sorrow as she may.
This she does. But every autumn the king makes a feast, and
invites to it all the nuns in the cloister. Margaret is missed,
and asked for. Is she sick or dead? Why does she not come to the
feast, like other merry dames? The wicked abbess answers, Your
daughter is neither sick nor dead; she goes with child, like
other merry dames. The king rides off to the cloister, encounters
his daughter, and demands who is the father of her child. She
replies that she will sooner die than tell. The king leaves her
in wrath, but returns presently, resolved to burn the convent,
and Margaret in it. Olaf comes from the wood, tired and weary,
sees the cloister burning, and quenches the flames with his
heart's blood.</p>

<p>The Icelandic ballad, 'Margretar kv&aelig;&eth;i,'
&Iacute;slenzk Fornkv&aelig;&eth;i, Grundtvig and Sigur&eth;sson,
No 14, has the same story. It is, however, the man who brings on
the discovery by asking the woman's parentage. The editors inform
us that the same subject is treated in an unprinted Icelandic
ballad, less popular as to style and stanza, in the Arne
Magnussen collection, 154.</p>

<p>The story of Kullervo, incorporated in what is called the
national epic of the Finns, the Kalevala, has striking
resemblances with the ballads of the Bonny Hind class. While
returning home in his sledge from a somewhat distant errand,
Kullervo met three times a girl who was travelling on snow-shoes,
and invited her to get in with him. She rejected his invitation
with fierceness, and the third time he pulled her into the sledge
by force. She angrily bade him let her go, or she would dash the
sledge to pieces; but he won her over by showing her rich things.
The next morning she asked what was his race and family; for it
seemed to her that he must come of a great line. "No," he said,
"neither of great nor small. I am Kalervo's unhappy son. Tell me
of what stock art thou." "Of neither great nor small," she
answered. "I am Kalervo's unhappy daughter." She was, in fact, a
long-lost sister of Kullervo's, who, when a child, had gone to
the wood for berries, and had never found her way home. She had
wept the first day and the second; the third and fourth, the
fifth and sixth, she had tried every way to kill herself. She
broke out in heart-piercing lamentations:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'O that I had died then, wretched!<br/>
O that I had perished, weak one!<br/>
Had not lived to hear these horrors,<br/>
Had not Iived this shame to suffer!'</td></tr>

</table>

<p>So saying she sprang from the sledge into the river, and found
relief under the waters.</p>

<p>Kullervo, mad with anguish, went home to his mother, and told
her what had happened. He asked only how he might die, &mdash; by
wolf or bear, by whale or sea-pike. His mother vainly sought to
soothe him. He consented to live only till the wrongs of his
parents had been revenged. His mother tried to dissuade him even
from seeking a hero's death in fight.</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>'If thou die in battle, tell me,<br/>
What protection shall remain then<br/>
For the old age of thy father?'<br/>
'Let him die in any alley,<br/>
Lay his life down in the house-yard.'<br/>
'What protection shall remain then<br/>
For the old age of thy mother?'<br/>
'Let her die on any straw-truss;<br/>
Let her stifle in the stable.'<br/>
'Who shall then be left thy brother,<br/>
Who stand by him in mischances?'<br/>
'Let him pine away in the forest,<br/>
Let him drop down on the common.'<br/>
'Who shall then be left thy sister,<br/>
Who stand by her in mischances?'<br/>
'When she goes to the well for water,<br/>
Or to the washing, let her stumble.'</td></tr>

<p>Kullervo had his fill of revenge. Meanwhile father, brother,
sister, and mother died, and he came back to his home to find it
empty and cold. A voice from his mother's grave seemed to direct
him to go to the wood for food: obeying it, he came again to the
polluted spot, where grass or flowers would not grow any more. He
asked his sword would it like to feed on guilty flesh and drink
wicked blood. The sword said, Why should I not like to feed on
guilty flesh and drink wicked blood, I that feed on the flesh of
the good
<a name="Page_I_446"/>
and drink the blood of the sinless? Kullervo set the
sword hilt in the earth, and threw himself on the point.
(Kalewala, &uuml;bertragen von Schiefner, runes 35, 36.)</p>

<p>The dialogue between Kullervo and his mother is very like a
passage in another Finnish rune, 'Werinen Pojka,' 'The Bloody
Son,' Schroter, Finnische Runen, 124, ed. 1819; 150, ed. 1834.
This last is a form of the ballad known in Scottish as '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_13.html">Edward</a>,'
No 13, or of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_49.html">The Twa Brothers</a>,' No 49. Something similar is
found in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_51.html">Lizie Wan</a>,' No 51.</p>

<p>The passage 5-7 is a commonplace that may be expected to recur
under the same or analogous circumstances, as it does in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_39.html">Tam Lin</a>,'
<b>D</b>, 'The Knight and Shepherd's Daughter,' 'The Maid
and the Magpie,' and in one version of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_217.html">The Broom of Cowdenknows</a>.'
These are much less serious ballads, and the tone of stanza 5,
which so ill befits the distressful situation, is perhaps owing
to that stanza's having been transferred from some copy of one of
these. It might well change places with this, from 'The Knight
and Shepherd's Daughter,' <b>A</b>:</p>

<p>Much better with the solemn adjuration in the F&auml;r&ouml;e
'Margaret,' or even this in 'Ebbe Galt,' Danske Viser, No 63,
