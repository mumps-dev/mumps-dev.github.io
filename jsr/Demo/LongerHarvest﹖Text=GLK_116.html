<h3>116. Adam Bell, Clim of the Clough, And william of Cloudesly</h3>

<p>'Adam Bell' is licensed to John Kynge in the Stationers'
Registers, 19 July, 1557 - 9 July, 1558. Again, among copies
which were Sampson Awdeley's, to John Charlewood, 15 January,
1582; and, among copies which were John Charlwoode's, to James
Robertes, 31 May, 1594. Seven reprints of the seventeenth
century, later than d, are noted in Mr. W.C. Hazlitt's Handbook,
p. 35.</p>

<p>The rescue of Robin Hood by Little John and Much in No. 119,
sts. 61-82, has a general resemblance to the rescue of Cloudesly
by Adam and Clim in this ballad, sts. 52 ff . The rescue of Will
Stutly (No. 141) has also some slight similarity, sts. 26-33.</p>

<p>The shooting of an apple from a boy's head (sts. 151-162) is,
as is well known, a trait in several German and Norse traditions,
and these particular feats, as well as everything resembling
them, have been a subject of eager discussion in connection with
the apocryphal history of William Tell. The story is not
remarkably widespread. The seven versions agree in two points:
the shot is compulsory; the archer meditates revenge in case he
harms the person on whose head the mark is placed. These features
are wanting in the English ballad. William of Cloudesly offers of
his own free motion to shoot an apple from his son's head, and
this after the king had declared him the best archer he had ever
seen, for splitting a hazel-rod at twenty score paces; so that
the act was done purely for glory. To be sure, the king threatens
him with death if he does not achieve what he has undertaken, as
death is also threatened in four of the seven German-Scandinavian
stories for refusal to try the shot or for missing; but the
threats in sts. 154 f. of the English ballad are a revival of the
vow in sts. 119 f. The shooting of the apple from the boy's head,
isolated from any particular connection, is perhaps all of the
German-Scandinavian story that was known to the English
ballad-maker, and all minor resemblances may well be 
fortuitous.</p>

<p>If the shooting of an apple by somebody from somebody's head
is to be regarded as the kernel of the story, its area may then
he considerably extended. For various remoter parallels of this
kind, see Child, in, 19 ff., where a full discussion will be
found. Professor Child is opposed to the mythical explanation and
takes particularly strong ground against making a sun-god out of
William of Cloudesly. He sums up in the following sentence: "A
story long current in Europe, a mythical story if you please,
could certainly be taken up by an English ballad-maker without
prejudice to the substantial and simply romantic character of his
hero."</p>
