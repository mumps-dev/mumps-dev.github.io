<h3>The English and Scottish Popular Ballads</h3>

<h4>by Francis James Child</h4>

<p>The rich field of English balladry was a virgin territory
before Francis James Child entered it. Only a few scattered
editions of a portion of the ballad texts had been published,
each filled with unacknowledged editorial changes and distortions
of the original manuscripts. Prof. Child compiled all the extant
ballads with all known variations and made them available for the
first time, together with his own invaluable commentary, in a
single source that maintained absolute fidelity to the original
texts. His ten-part study, "The English and Scottish Popular
Ballads," published from 1882 to 1898, became the definitive
collection of popular ballads in the English language, never to
be superseded.</p>

<p>Besides its great value in its own right, Prof. Child's work
provided the groundwork for all future studies in the field;
there is scarcely a ballad student since who has not openly paid
tribute to Child and acknowledged the great debt that all present
and future students in the field owe to him. This is a major
scholarly work, one that no ballad student, folklorist, or student
of English literature should be without, And because of the
simple, direct appeal of the ballads themselves, this collection
should also offer many rewarding hours of pleasure to any general
reader with an interest in folklore or folk music. "This great
achievement," as the Dictionary of American Biography so aptly
put it, "seems destined to endure as long as the ballads
themselves; few scholars have left so lasting a monument."</p>

<p>The entire collection comprises 305 ballads, many with ten or
more versions. Prefacing each ballad section, there is a
comprehensive discussion of the history, date, lore, and
different versions of the ballad, the place of the ballad in
various cultural traditions and how the material in English and
Scottish popular ballads is related to that of folktales of
Europe and other parts of the world. Included in the latter
discussion is a comparison of treatments of the same or similar
tales in many languages and cultures, including French, Italian,
German, Slavic, Swedish, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish,
Lettish, Romaic, Lithuanian, Albanian, Icelandic, Norwegian,
Magyar, etc.</p>

<p>This volume V consists of Parts IX and X of the original set.
Part IX contains ballads 266-305. Part X contains several bibliographical
listings (totalling nearly 3,000 sources), 3 indexes, a glossary,
actual music for some of the ballads, and other supplementary information.
Appended to this volume is an essay by Walter Morris Hart entitled 
"Professor Child and the Ballad."</p>

<p>Unabridged and unaltered republication of 1st edition (1894, 1898).

<p><b>A DOVER EDITION DESIGNED FOR YEARS OF USE!</b></p>

<p>We have made every effort to make this the best book possible.
Our paper is opaque, with minimal show-through; it will not
discolor or become brittle with age. Pages are sewn in
signatures, in the method traditionally used for the best books,
and will not drop out, as often happens with paperbacks held
together with glue. Books open flat for easy reference. The
binding will not crack or split. This is a permanent book.</p>
