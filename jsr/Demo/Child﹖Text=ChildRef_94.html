<h3>Young Waters</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Percy's Reliques, 1765, II, 172. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d09401.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Percy took this ballad "from a copy printed not long since at
Glasgow, in one sheet 8vo," and he informs us that the world was
indebted for its publication to the Lady Jean Hume, sister to the
Earl of Hume. Maidment, Scotish Ballads and Songs, His torical
and Traditionary, II, 62, gives the title of the first edition as
follows: Young Waters, an Ancient Scotish Poem, never before
printed. Glasgow: printed and sold by Robert and Andrew Foulis.
MDCCLV. Small 4to, pp. 8. He does not say whether he prints from
the original edition. The ballad was repeated in Herd's Ancient
and Modern Scots Songs, 1769, p. 238; in Ritson's Scotish Song,
1794, II, 181, with the variation of a word or two; and in
Pinkerton's Select Scotish Ballads, 1783, I, 72, with arbitrary
changes.</p>

<p>Motherwell, Minstrelsy, Introduction, p. lxviii, note 16, says
he had never met with any traditionary version of this ballad.
There is a copy in the Skene Manuscripts, p. 23, which in all
likelihood was learned by the writer from print. Buchan, who may
generally be relied upon to produce a longer ballad than anybody
else, has 'Young Waters' in thirty-nine stanzas, "the only
complete version which he had ever met." Of this copy I will only
say that everything which is not in the edition of 1755 (itself a
little the worse for editing) is a counterfeit of the lowest
description. Nevertheless it is given in an appendix; for much
the same reason that thieves are photographed.</p>

<p>It is possible, and Aytoun, <b>I</b>, 93, thinks highly
probable, that this ballad may have been founded on some real
event in Scottish history; but Aytoun shows a commendable
discretion in his conclusion that, "though various conjectures
have been hazarded as to its origin, none appear sufficiently
plausible to warrant their adoption," an opinion in which
Maidment fully concurs. Chambers, who unhesitatingly accepted
Buchan's ballad, did not, in 1829, entertain the least doubt that
Young Waters was one of the Scottish nobles executed by James I
after his return from his captivity in England, and very probably
Walter Stuart, second son of the Duke of Albany: The Scottish
Ballads, p. 34. Thirty years later he had no more doubt that the
ballad was composed by Lady Wardlaw.</p>

<p>A Scandinavian ballad, historical to the extent that one
version has historical names, exhibits the principal incidents of
the short story of 'Young Waters.' <b>Danish</b>. 'Folke
Lovmands&oslash;n og Dronning Helvig,' texts of the 16th century,
Grundtvig, III, 691, No 178, <b>A</b>-<b>D</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d094_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
<b>Swedish</b>. <b>A</b>, 'Falkvard Lugermanson,' tradition of
this century, Arwidsson, II, 62, No 80. <b>B</b>, manuscript of
the last century, Grundtvig, III, 697. The king and queen, Danish
<b>B</b>, are Magnus I of Sweden and his wife Helvig (died 1290,
1325). Folke Lovmands&oslash;n is in high favor with dames and
maids, but especially with the queen, to whose service he is
devoted. A little wee page plays the part of the wily lord of
'Young Waters' in exciting the king's jealousy. The innocent
young knight is rolled down hill in a tun set with knives.</p>
