<h3>178. Captain Car, or, Edom o Gordon</h3>


<p>P. 426, note *. This history borrows from Sir Robert Gordon.
See what he says, p. 166 f., and also previously, p. 164 ff.</p>

<p>428 a. <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>. "I have a manuscript where the
whole scene is transferred to Ayrshire, and the incendiary is
called Johnnie Faa." Note of Sir W. Scott in Sharpe's Ballad
Book, ed. 1880, p. 142.</p>

<p>This copy has not as yet been recovered, but there is another
at Abbotsford, a fine fragment, in which Lady Campbell is the
heroine. As to Adam McGordon, the c of Mac is often dropped, so
that Adam MaGordon and Adam o Gordon are of pretty much the same
sound (a remark of Mr. Macmath). The Andrew Watty of
13<sup>3</sup> is noted on the last page of the Manuscript to be
"a riding man."</p>

<p>"Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border Minstrelsy," No 75,
Abbotsford. Communicated to Scott November 6, 1803, by Bruce
Campbell, Sornbeg, Galston, Ayrshire, through David Boyle,
Advocate, afterwards Lord Justice General of Scotland.</p>
