<h3>The False Lover Won Back</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>'The Fause Lover,' Buchan's Manuscripts, I, 114;
Buchan's Ballads of the North of Scotland, I, 268. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d21801.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
<li>The place where my love Johnny dwells,' Christie's

<p>A young man is deserting one maid for another. The object of
his new fancy lives at a distance, and he is on his way to her.
He is followed by his old love from stage to stage; he repelling
her, and she tenderly remonstrating. His heart gradually softens;
he buys her gifts from town to town, and though each time he bids
her go back, he ends with buying her a wedding gown (ring) and
marrying her.</p>

<p>Two pretty stanzas in A, 4, 5, seem not to belong to this
story. The inconstant youth would have been only too glad to have
the faithful maid look to other men, and gives her all liberty to
do so. These two stanzas are first found in Herd's Manuscripts,
I, 53, and in Herd's Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs, 1776, II,
6, as follows:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right">&nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>False luve, and hae ye played me this,<br/>
In the simmer, mid the flowers?<br/>
I sail repay ye back agen,<br/>
In the winter, mid the showers.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">&nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>Bot again, dear luve, and again, dear luve,<br/>
Will ye not turn again?<br/>
As ye look to ither women,<br/>
Sall I to ither men.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>In a manuscript at Abbotsford, entitled Scottish Songs, 1795
(containing pieces dated up to 1806), fol. 69, they stand
thus:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right">&nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>False luve, and hae ye played me this,<br/>
In simmer amang the flowers?<br/>
I shall repay you back agen<br/>
In winter amang the showers.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" align="right">&nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>Unless again, again, dear luve,<br/>
But if ye turn agen,<br/>
As ye look other women to,<br/>
Sall I to other men.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Scott has put these verses, a little varied, into Davie
Gellatley's mouth, in the ninth chapter of 'Waverley.' The first,
with a change, occurs also in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_219.html">The Gardener</a>,' No 219, <b>A</b> 7,
<b>B</b> 15, <b>C</b> 3.</p>

<p><b>A</b> is translated by Rosa Warrens, Schottische
Volkslieder, p. 141, No 32; by Gerhard, p. 114.</p>
