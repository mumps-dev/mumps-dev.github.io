<h3>294. Dugal Quin</h3>


<p>P. 165. Dugald Gunn, Mr. Macmath suggests, may have been a
mistaken reading of Scott's difficult handwriting on the part of
the editor of the Ballad Book; as is certainly the case with
regard to The Stirrup of Northumberland, V, 207 b, No 9,
<b>G</b>.</p>

<p>I unhappily forgot Buchan's 'Donald M'Queen's Flight wi Lizie
Menzie,' Ballads of the North of Scotland, II, 117, which, though
I think it corrupted at the end, removes the principal verbal
difficulties in the Old Lady's copy. Mr. Walker of Aberdeen has
reminded me of Buchan's ballad, and he had previously suggested
to me that Dunfermline was proprietor of Fyvie, and this fact had
disposed me to read Fyvie where the text already given has farei,
farie. Of the rightfulness of this reading there can now be no
doubt, though information is desirable as to the tempting cheese
of Fyvie, of which I have not found mention elsewhere.</p>

<p>Buchan, II, 319, makes the following note on his copy:
&mdash;</p>

<p>"Donald M'Queen, the hero of this ballad, was one of the
servants of Baron Seaton of Fyvie, who, with his master, had fled
to France after the rebellion in 1715. Baron Seaton having died
in France, Donald, his man, returned to Fyvie with one of his
master's best horses, and procured a love potion, alias 'the
tempting cheese of Fyvie,' which had the effect of bewitching,
or, in other words, casting the glamour oer his mistress, Lizie
Menzie, the Lady of Fyvie. Some years afterwards this lady went
through the country as a common pauper, when, being much
fatigued, and in a forlorn condition, she fell fast asleep in the
mill of Fyvie, whither she had gone to solicit an alms (charity):
on her awakening, she declared that she had just now slept as
soun a sleep with the meal-pock beneath her head, as ever she had
done on the best down-bed of Fyvie. This information I had from
James Rankin, an old blind man, who is well acquainted with the
traditions of the country."</p>

<p>Alexander Seaton acquired Fyvie, it is said, in 1596, and in
1606 was created Earl of Dunfermline. Castle and title were
forfeited in 1689, and the property was purchased of the crown in
1726 by the Earl of Aberdeen. Dunfermline had no horses for
Dugald or Donald to take after 1689. The whole story of Lizie
Menzie, Baroness of Seaton, seems to be a fiction as sheer as it
is vulgar. Lizie Menzie's forsaking her husband for a footman is
refuted by the well-informed Rankin himself, who tells us that
the husband had died in France before his man " returned to Fyvie
with one of his master's best horses." The conclusion is borrowed
mostly from 'The Gypsy Laddie,' where even the drinking of one's
own brewage is to be found; but 'The Gypsy Laddie' is not to be
reproached with the foolish last stanza.</p>
