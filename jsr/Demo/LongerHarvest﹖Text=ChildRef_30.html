<li>Percy Manuscript, p. 24. Hales &amp; Furnivall, I, 61; Madden's Syr

</ol>

<p>The mutilation of the earlier pages of the Percy manuscript
leaves us in possession of only one half of this ballad, and that
half in eight fragments, so that even the outline of the story
cannot be fully made out.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> We have, to be sure, the whole of a
French poem which must be regarded as the probable source of the
ballad, and, in view of the recklessness of the destroyer Time,
may take comfort; for there are few things in this kind that the
Middle Ages have bequeathed which we could not better spare. But
the losses from the English ballad are still very regrettable,
since from what is in our hands we can see that the story was
treated in an original way, and so much so that comparison does
not stead us materially.</p>

<p>'King Arthur and King Cornwall' is apparently an imitation, or
a traditional variation, of Charlemagne's Journey to Jerusalem
and Constantinople, a <i>chanson de geste</i> of complete
individuality and of remarkable interest. This all but
incomparable relic exists in only a single manuscript,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and
that ill written and not older than the end of the thirteenth
century, while the poem itself may be assigned to the beginning
of the twelfth, if not to the latter part of the eleventh.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
Subsequently, the story, with modifications, was introduced into
the romance of Galien, and in this setting it occurs in three
forms, two manuscript of the fifteenth century, and the third a
printed edition of the date 1500. These are all in prose, but
betray by metrical remains imbedded in them their descent fro111
a romance in verse, which there are reasons for putting at least
as early as the beginning of the fourteenth century.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A very little of the story, and this little
<a name="Page_I_275"/>
much changed, is
found in Italian romances of Charles's Journey to Spain and of
Ogier the Dane. The derivation from Galien is patent.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The Journey of Charlemagne achieved great popularity, as it
needs must. It forms a section of the Karlamagnus Saga, a prose
translation into Norse of <i>gestes</i> of Charles and his peers,
made in the thirteenth century, and probably for King
H&aacute;kon the Old, though this is not expressly said, as in
the case of the 'Mantle.' Through the Norwegian version the story
of Charles's journey passed into the other Scandinavian dialects.
There is a Swedish version, slightly defective, existing in a
manuscript earlier than 1450, and known to be older than the
manuscript, and a Danish abridgment, thought to have been made
from the Swedish version, is preserved in a manuscript dated
1480, which again is probably derived from an elder. Like the
'Mantle,' the Journey of Charlemagne is treated in Icelandic
R&iacute;mur, the oldest manuscript being put at about 1500.
These Rhymes (Geiplur, Gabs, Japes), though their basis is the
Norwegian saga, present variations from the existing manuscripts
of this saga. There is also a F&auml;r&ouml;e traditional ballad
upon this theme, 'Geipa-t&aacute;ttur.' This ballad has much that
is peculiar to itself.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Charlemagne's Journey was also turned into Welsh in the
thirteenth century. Three versions are known, of which the best
is in the Red Book of Hergest.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Let us now see what is narrated in the French poem.</p>

<p>One day when Charlemagne was at St. Denis he had put on his
crown and sword, and his wife had on a most beautiful crown, too.
Charles took her by the hand, under an olive-tree, and asked her
if she had ever seen a king to whom crown and sword were so
becoming. The empress was so unwise as to reply that possibly he
thought too well of himself: she knew of a king who appeared to
even better advantage when he wore his crown. Charles angrily
demanded where this king was to be found: they would wear their
crowns together, and if the French sided with her, well; but if
she had not spoken truth, he would cut off her head. The empress
endeavored to explain away what she had said: the other king was
simply richer, but not so good a knight, etc. Charles bade her
name him, on her head. There being no escape, the empress said
she had heard much of Hugo, the emperor of Greece and
Constantinople. "By my faith," said Charles, " you have made me
angry and lost my love, and are in a fair way to lose your head,
too. I will never rest till I have seen this king."</p>

<a name="Page_I_276"/>
<p>The emperor, having made his offering at St. Denis, returned to
Paris, taking with him his twelve peers and some thousand of
knights. To these he announced that they were to accompany him to
Jerusalem, to adore the cross and the sepulchre, and that he
would incidentally look up a king that he had heard of. They were
to take with them seven hundred camels, laden with gold and
silver, and be prepared for an absence of seven years.</p>

<p>Charlemagne gave his people a handsome equipment, but not of
arms. They left behind them their lances and swords, and took the
pilgrim's staff and scrip. When they came to a great plain it
appeared that the number was not less than eighty thousand: but
we do not have to drag this host through the story, which
concerns itself only with Charles and his peers. They arrived at
Jerusalem one fine day, selected their inns, and went to the
minster. Here Jesus and his apostles had sung mass, and the
chairs which they had occupied were still there. Charles seated
himself in the middle one, his peers on either side. A Jew came
in, and, seeing Charles, fell to trembling; so fierce was the
countenance of the emperor that he dared not look at it, but fled
from the church to the patriarch, and begged to be baptized, for
God himself and the twelve apostles were come. The patriarch went
to the church, in procession, with his clergy. Charles rose and
made a profound salutation, the priest and the monarch embraced,
and the patriarch inquired who it was that had assumed to enter
that church as he had done. "Charles is my name," was the answer.
"Twelve kings have I conquered, and I am seeking a thirteenth
whom I have heard of. I have come to Jerusalem to adore the cross
and the sepulchre." The patriarch proving gracious, Charles went
on to ask for relics to take home with him. "A plentet en avrez,"
says the patriarch; "St. Simeon's arm, St. Lazarus's head, St.
Stephen's &mdash;" "Thanks!" "The sudarium, one of the nails, the
crown of thorns, the cup, the dish, the knife, some of St.
Peter's beard, some hairs from his head &mdash;" "Thanks!" "Some
of Mary's milk, of the holy shift &mdash;" And all these Charles
received.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> He stayed four months in Jerusalem, and began the
church of St. Mary. He presented the patriarch with a hundred
mule-loads of gold and silver, and asked "his leave and pardon" to
return to France: but first he would find out the king whom his
wife had praised. They take the way through Jericho to gather
palms, The relics are so strong that every stream they come to
divides before them, every blind man receives sight, the crooked
are made straight, and the dumb speak.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> On reaching
Constantinople they have ample reason to be impressed with the
magnificence of the place. Passing twenty thousand knights, who
are playing at chess and tables, dressed in pall and ermine, with
fur cloaks training at their feet, and three thousand damsels in
equally sumptuous attire, who are disporting with their lovers,
they come to the king, who is at that moment taking his day at
the plough, not on foot, goad in hand, but seated most splendidly
in a chair drawn by mules, and holding a gold wand, the plough all
gold, too; none of this elegance, however, impairing the
straightness of his majesty's furrow. The kings exchange
greetings. Charles tells Hugo that he is last from Jerusalem, and
should be glad to see him and his knights. Hugo makes him free to
stay a year, if he likes, unyokes the oxen, and conducts his
guests to the palace.</p>

<p>The palace is gorgeous in the extreme, and, omitting other
architectural details, it is circular, and so constructed as to
turn like a wheel when the wind strikes it from the west. Charles
thinks his own wealth not worth a glove in comparison, and
remembers how he
<a name="Page_I_277"/>
had threatened his wife. "Lordings," he says,
"many a palace have I seen, but none like this had even
Alexander, Constantine, or C&aelig;sar." At that moment a strong
wind arose which set the palace in lively motion; the emperor was
fain to sit down on the floor; the twelve peers were all upset,
and as they lay on their backs, with faces covered, said one to
the other, "This is a bad business: the doors are open, and yet
we can't get out!" But as evening approached the wind subsided;
the Franks recovered their legs, and went to supper. At the table
they saw the queen and the princess, a beautiful blonde, of whom
Oliver became at once enamored. After a most royal repast, the
king conducted Charles and the twelve to a bed-chamber, in which
there were thirteen beds. It is doubtful whether modern luxury
can vie with the appointments in any respect, and certain that we
are hopelessly behind in one, for this room was lighted by a
carbuncle. But, again, there was one luxury which Hugo did not
allow them, and this was privacy, even so much privacy as
thirteen can have. He had put a man in a hollow place under a
marble stair, to watch them through a little hole.</p>

<p>The Franks, as it appears later, had drunk heavily at supper,
and this must be their excuse for giving themselves over, when in
a foreign country, to a usage or propensity which they had no
doubt indulged in at home, and which is familiar in northern
poetry and saga, that of making brags (gabs, Anglo-Saxon
be&oacute;t, gilp<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>). Charles began: Let Hugo arm his best
man in two hauberks and two helms, and set him on a charger:
then, if he will lend me his sword, I will with a blow cut
through helms, hauberks, and saddle, and if I let it have its
course, the blade shall never be recovered but by digging a
spear's depth in the ground. "Perdy," says the man in hiding,
"what a fool King Hugo was when he gave you lodging!"</p>

<p>Roland followed: Tell Hugo to lend me his horn, and I will go
into yon plain and blow such a blast that not a gate or a door in
all the city shall be left standing, and a good man Hugo will be,
if he faces me, not to have his beard burned from his face and
his fur robe carried away. Again said the man under the stair,
"What a fool was King Hugo!"</p>

<p>The emperor next called upon Oliver, whose gab was:</p>

<p>'Prenget li reis sa fille qui tant at bloi le peil,<br/>
En sa chambre nos metet en un lit en requeit;<br/>
Se jo n'ai testimoigne de li anuit cent feiz,<br/>
Demain perde la teste, par covent li otrei.'</p>

<p>"You will stop before that," said the spy; "great shame have
you spoken."</p>

<p>Archbishop Turpin's brag was next in order: it would have been
more in keeping for Turpin of Hounslow Heath, and we have all
seen it performed in the travelling circus. While three of the
king's best horses are running at full speed on the plain, he
will overtake and mount the foremost, passing the others, and
will keep four big apples in constant motion from one hand to the
other; if he lets one fall, put out his eyes.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> "A good brag
this," is the comment of the simple scout (<i>l'escolte</i>),
"and no shame to my lord."</p>

<p>William of Orange will take in one hand a metal ball which
thirty men have never been able to stir, and will hurl it at the
palace wall and bring down more than forty toises of it. "The
king is a knave if he does not make you try," says
<i>l'escolte</i>.</p>

<p>The other eight gabs may be passed over,
<a name="Page_I_278"/>
save one. Bernard de
Brusban says, "You see that roaring stream? To-morrow I will make
it leave its bed, cover the fields, fill the cellars of the city,
drench the people, and drive King Hugo into his highest tower,
from which he shall never come down without my leave." "The man
is mad," says the spy. "What a fool King Hugo was! As soon as
morning dawns they shall all pack."</p>

<p>The spy carries his report to his master without a moment's
delay. Hugo swears that if the brags are not accomplished as
made, his guests shall lose their heads, and orders out a hundred
thousand men-at-arms to enforce his resolution.</p>

<p>When the devout emperor of the west came from mass the next
morning (Hugo was evidently not in a state of mind to go), he
advanced to meet his brother of Constantinople, olive branch in
hand; but Hugo called out from far off, "Charles, why did you
make me the butt of your brags and your scorns?" and repeated
that all must be done, or thirteen heads would fall. Charles
replied that they had drunk a good deal of wine the night before,
and that it was the custom for the French when they had gone to
bed to allow themselves in jesting. He desired to speak with his
knights. When they were together, the emperor said that they had
drunk too much, and had uttered what they ought not. He caused
the relics to be brought, and they all fell to praying and
beating their breasts, that they might be saved from Hugo's
wrath, when lo, an angel appeared, who bade them not be afraid;
they bad committed a great folly yesterday, and must never brag
again, but for this time, "Go, begin, not one of them shall
fail."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Charles returned to Hugo master of the situation. He repeated
that they bad drunk too much wine the night before, and went on
to say that it was an outrage on Hugo's part to set a spy in the
room, and that they knew a land where such an act would be
accounted villainy: "but all shall be carried out; choose who
shall begin." Hugo said, Oliver; and let him not fall short of
his boast, or I will cut off his head, and the other twelve shall
share his fate. The next morning, in pursuance of an arrangement
made between Oliver and the princess, the king was informed that
what had been undertaken had been precisely discharged. "The
first has saved himself," says Hugo ; "by magic, I believe; now I
wish to know about the rest." "What next?" says Charlemagne.
William of Orange was called for, threw off his furs, lifted the
huge ball with one hand, hurled it at the wall, and threw down
more than forty toises. "They are enchanters," said the king to
his men. "Now I should like to see if the rest will do as much.
If one of them fails, I will hang them all to-morrow." "Do you
want any more of the gabs?" asked Charles. Hugo called upon
Bernard to do what he had threatened. Bernard asked the prayers
of the emperor, ran down to the water, and made the sign of the
cross. All the water left its bed, spread over the fields, came
into the city, filled the cellars, drenched the people, and drove
King Hugo into his highest tower; Charles and the peers being the
wbile ensconced in an old pine-tree, all praying for God's
pity.</p>

<p>Charles in the tree heard Hugo in the tower making his moan:
he would give the emperor all his treasure, would become his man
and hold his kingdom of him. The emperor was moved, and prayed
that the flood might stop, and at once the water began to ebb.
Hugo was able to descend from his tower, and he came to Charles,
under an "ympe tree," and repeated what he had uttered in the
moment of extremity. "Do you want the rest of the gabs? " asked
Charles. "Ne de ceste semaine," replied Hugo. "Then, since you
are my man," said tbe emperor, "we will make a holiday and wear
our crowns together."
<a name="Page_I_279"/>
When the French saw the two monarchs
walking together, and Charles overtopping Hugo by fifteen inches,
tbey said the queen was a fool to compare anybody with him.</p>

<p>After this promenade there was mass, at which Turpin
officiated, and then a grand dinner. Hugo once more proffered all
his treasures to Charles, but Charles would not take a denier.
"We must be going," he said. The French mounted their mules, and
went off in high spirits. Very happy was Charles to have
conquered such a king without a battle. Charles went directly to
St. Denis, and performed his devotions. The nail and the crown he
deposited on the altar, distributed the other relics over the
kingdom, and for the love of the sepulchre he gave up his anger
against the queen.</p>

<p>The story in the English ballad, so far as it is to be
collected from our eight fragments, is that Arthur, represented
as King of Little Britain, while boasting to Gawain of his round
table, is told by Guenever that she knows of one immeasurably
finer; the very trestle is worth his halls and his gold, and the
palace it stands in is worth all Little Britain besides; but not
a word will she say as to where this table and this goodly
building may be. Arthur makes a vow never to sleep two nights in
one place till he sees that round table; and, taking for
companions Gawain, Tristram, Sir Bredbeddle, and an otherwise
unknown Sir Marramiles, sets out on the quest.</p>

<p>The pilgrimage which, to save his dignity, Charles makes a
cover for his visit to the rival king forms no part of Arthur's
programme.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The five assume a palmer's weed simply for
disguise, and travel east and west, in many a strange country,
only to arrive at Cornwall, so very little a way from home.</p>

<p>The proud porter of Cornwall's gate, a minion swain,
befittingly clad in a suit of gold, for his master is the richest
king in Christendom, or yet in heathenness, is evidently
impressed with Arthur's bearing, as is quite the rule in such
cases:<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> he has been porter thirty years and three, but [has
never seen the like]. Cornwall would naturally ask the pilgrims
some questions. From their mentioning some shrine of Our Lady he
infers that they have been in Britain, &mdash; Little Britain we
must suppose to be meant. Cornwall asks if they ever knew King
Arthur, and boasts that he had lived seven years in Little
Britain, and had had a daughter by Arthur's wife, now a lady of
radiant beauty, and Arthur has none such.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> He then sends for
his steed, which he can ride three times as far in a day as
Arthur can any of his, and we may suppose that he also exhibits
to his guests a horn and a sword of remarkable properties, and a
Burlow-Beanie, or Billy-blin, a seven-headed, fire-breathing
fiend whom he has in his service. Arthur is then conducted to
bed, and the Billy-Blin, shut up, as far as we can make out, in
some sort of barrel, or other vessel,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_016','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
<a name="Page_I_280"/>
is set by Arthur's
bed-side to hear and report the talk of the pilgrims. Now, it
would seem, the knights make each their vow or brag. Arthur's is
that he will be the death of Cornwall King before he sees Little
Britain. Gawain, who represents Oliver, will have Cornwall's
daughter home with him. Here there is an unlucky gap. Tristram
should undertake to carry off the horn, Marramiles the steed, and
Sir Bredbeddle the sword. But first it would be necessary to
subdue the loathly fiend. Bredbeddle goes to work without
dallying, bursts open the rub-chadler with his sword, and fights
the fire-breathing monster in a style that is a joy to see; but
sword, knife, and axe all break, and he is left without a weapon.
Yet he had something better to fall back on, and that was a
little book which he had found by the seaside, no doubt in the
course of those long travels which conducted the pilgrims from
Little Britain to Cornwall. It was probably a book of Evangiles;
our Lord had written it with his hands and sealed it with his
blood. With this little book, which in a manner takes the place
of the relics in the French tale, for the safety of the pilgrims
and the accomplisbment of their vows are secured through it,
Bredbeddle conjures the Burlow-beanie, and shuts him up till
wanted in a "wall of stone," which reminds us of the place in
which Hugo's spy is concealed. He then reports to Arthur, who has
a great desire to see the fiend in all his terrors, and, upon the
king's promising to stand firm, Bredbeddle makes the fiend start
out again, with his seven heads and the fire flying out of his
mouth. The Billy-Blin is now entirely amenable to command:
Bredbeddle has only to "conjure" him to do a thing, and it is
done. First he fetches down the steed. Marramiles, who perhaps
had vowed to bring off the horse, considers that he is the man to
ride him, but finds he can do nothing with him, and has to call
on BredbeddIe for help. The Billy-Blin is required to tell how
the steed is to be ridden, and reveals that three strokes of a
gold wand which stands in Cornwall's study-window will make him
spring like spark from brand. And so it comes out that Cornwall
is a magician. Next the horn has to be fetched, but, when
brought, it cannot be sounded. For this a certain powder is
required. This the fiend procures, and Tristram blows a blast
which rends the horn up to the midst.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_017','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Finally the
Billy-Blin is conjured to fetch the sword, and with this sword
Arthur goes and strikes off Cornwall's head. So Arthur keeps his
vow, and, so far as we can see, all the rest are in a condition
to keep theirs.</p>

<p>The English ballad retains too little of the French story to
enable us to say what form of it this little was derived from.
The poem of Galien would cover all that is borrowed as well as
the Journey of Charlemagne. It may be regarded as an indication
of late origin that in this ballad Arthur is king of Little
Britain, that Bredbedclle and Marramiles are made the fellows of
Gawain and Tristram, Bredbeddle carrying off all the honors, and
that Cornwall has had an intrigue with Arthur's queen. The name
Bredbeddle is found elsewhere only in the late Percy version of
the romance of the Green Knight, Hales and Furnivall, II, 56,
which version alludes to a custom of the Knights of the Bath, an
order said to have been instituted by Henry IV at his coronation,
in 1399.</p>

<p>The F&auml;r&ouml;e ballad, 'Geipa-t&aacute;ttur,' exists in
four versions: <b>A</b>, Svabo's manuscript collection, 1782,
III, 1, 85 stanzas; <b>B</b>, Sand&oslash;bog, 1822, p. 49, 140
stanzas; <b>C</b>, Fugl&oslash;bog, c. 1840, p. 9, 120 stanzas;
<b>D</b>, Syder&oslash; version, obtained by Hammershaimb, 1848,
103 stanzas.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_018','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It repeats the story of the Norse saga, with a
<a name="Page_I_281"/>
moderate number of traditional accretions and changes. The
emperor, from his throne, asks his champions where is his
superior [equal] . They all drop their heads; no one ventures to
answer but the queen, who better had been silent. "The emperor of
Constantinople" (Hakin, <b>D</b>), she says, "is thy superior."
"If he is not," answers Karl, "thou shalt burn on bale." In
<b>B</b>, when they have already started for Constantinople,
Turpin persuades them to go rather to Jerusalem: in the other
versions it must be assumed that the holy city was on the route.
As Karl enters the church the bells ring and the candles light of
themselves, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. There are thirteen seats in the
choir: Karl takes the one that Jesus had occupied, and the peers
those of the apostles. A heathen tells the patriarch<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_019','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> that
the Lord is come down from heaven, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. The
patriarch proceeds to the church, with no attendance but his
altar-book [singing from his altar-book]; he asks Karl what he
has come for, and Karl replies, to see the halidoms, <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. In <b>B</b> the patriarch presents himself to
the emperor at his lodging, and inquires his purpose; and,
learning that he is on his way to Constantinople, for glory,
advises him first to go to the church, where the ways and means
of success are to be found. The patriarch gives Karl some of the
relics: the napkin on which Jesus had wiped his hands, cups from
which he had drunk, etc. Karl, in <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, now
announces that he is on his way to Constantinople; the patriarch
begs him not to go, for he will have much to suffer. At the
exterior gate of the palace will be twelve white bears, ready to
go at him; the sight of his sword [of the holy napkin, <b>B</b>]
will cause them to fall stone-dead, or at least harmless,
<b>B</b>. At the gate next within there will be twelve
wolf-dogs<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_020','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> [and further on twelve toads, <b>B</b>], which
must be disposed of in like wise : etc. The castle stands on a
hundred pillars, <b>A</b>, and is full of ingenious contrivances:
the floor goes up to the sky, and the roof comes down to the
ground, <b>B</b>. Karl now sets out, with the patriarch's blessing
and escort. Before they reach the palace they come upon three
hundred knights. and ladies dancing, which also had been
foretold, and at the portals of the palace they find and vanquish
the formidable beasts. The palace is to the full as splendid and
as artfully constructed as they had been informed: the floor goes
up and the roof comes down, <b>B</b>; there are monstrous figures
(?), with horns at their mouths, and upon a wind rising the horns
all sound, the building begins to revolve, and the Frenchmen jump
up, each clinging to the other, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>.
Karl remembers what his wife had said, <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>.</p>

<p>Of the reception by the monarch of Constantinople nothing
further is said. We are immediately taken to the bedroom, in
which there are twelve beds, with a thirteenth in the middle, and
also a stone arch, or vault, inside of which is a man with a
candle. Karl proposes that they shall choose feats, make boasts,
rouses [<i>skemtar</i>, jests, <b>C</b>]. These would inevitably
be more or less deranged and corrupted in the course of
tradition. <b>A</b> and <b>C</b> have lost many. Karl's boast,
dropped in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, is that he will smite King
H&aacute;kin, so that the sword's point shall stick in the
ground, <b>D</b>; hit the emperor on the neck and knock him off
his horse, <b>A</b>. Roland, in all, will blow the emperor's hair
off his head with the blast of his horn. Oliver's remains as in
the French poem. William of Orange's ball is changed to a bolt.
The exploit with the horses and apples is assigned to Bernard in
<b>D</b>, the only version which preserves it, as in the Norse
saga; and, as in the saga again, it is Turpin,
<a name="Page_I_282"/>
and not Bernard,
who brings in the river upon the town, and forces the king to
take refuge in the tower.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the spy reports in writing, and King
H&aacute;kin, <b>D</b>, says that Karl and his twelve peers shall
burn on the bale, <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, if they cannot
make good their boasts, <b>B</b>. Karl's queen appears to him in
his sleep, <b>A</b>, and bids him think of last night's words. It
is the queen of Constantinople in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>
who rouses Karl to a sense of his plight; in <b>B</b> she tells
him that the brags have been reported, and that burning will be
the penalty unless they be achieved. Karl then sees that his wife
knew what she was saying, and vows to give her Hildarheim and a
scarlet cloak if he gets home alive. He hastens to church; a dove
descends from heaven and sits on his arm [in <b>B</b> a voice
comes from heaven]; he is assured that the boasts shall all be
performed, but never let such a thing be done again. In <b>A</b>
three of the feats are executed, in <b>D</b> four, in <b>C</b>
seven, Oliver's in each case strictly, and Turpin's, naturally,
last. The king in <b>C</b> does the feat which is proposed by
Eimer in the saga. <b>A</b> and <b>C</b> end abruptly with
Turpin's exploit. In <b>D</b> Karl falls on his knees and prays,
and the water retires; Karl rides out of Constantinople, followed
three days on the road by Koronatus, as H&aacute;kin is now
called, stanza 103: it is Karlamagn&uacute;s that wears his crown
higher. <b>B</b> takes a turn of its own. Roland, Olger and
Oliver are called upon to do their brags. Roland blows so that
nobody in Constantinople can keep his legs, and the emperor falls
into the mud, but he blows not a hair off the emperor's head;
Olger slings the gold-bolt over the wall, but breaks off none;
Oliver gives a hundred kisses, as in the saga. The emperor
remarks each time, I hold him no champion that performs his rouse
that way. But Turpin's brag is thoroughly done; the emperor is
driven to the tower, and begs Karl to turn off the water; no more
feats shall be exacted. Now the two kaisers walk in the hall,
conferring about tribute, which Karl takes and rides away. When
he reaches home his queen welcomes him, and asks what happened at
Constantinople: "Hvat gekk af?" "This," says Karl; "I know the
truth now; you shall be queen as before, and shall have a voice
in the rule."</p>

<p>It is manifest that Charlemagne's pilgrimage to Jerusalem and
the visit to the king of Constantinople, though somewhat
intimately combined in the old French <i>geste</i>, were
originally distinct narratives. As far as we can judge, nothing
of the pilgrimage was retained by the English ballad. We are not
certain, even, that it is Charlemagne's visit to Hugo upon which
the ballad was formed, though the great popularity of the French
poem makes this altogether likely. As M. Gaston Paris has said
and shown,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_022','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> the visit to Hugo is one of a cycle of tales of
which the framework is this: that a king who regards himself as
the richest or most magnificent in the world is told that there
is somebody that outstrips him, and undertakes a visit to his
rival to determine which surpasses the other, threatening death
to the person who has disturbed his self-complacency, in case the
rival should turn out to be his inferior. A familiar example is
afforded by the tale of Aboulcassem, the first of the Mille et un
Jours. Haroun Alraschid was incessantly boasting that no prince
in the world was so generous as he.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_023','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The vizier Giafar humbly
exhorted the caliph not to praise himself, but to leave that to
others. The caliph, much piqued, demanded, Do you then know
anybody who compare's with me? Giafar felt compelled to reply
that there was
<a name="Page_I_283"/>
a young man at Basra, who, though in a private
station, was not inferior even to the caliph in point of
generosity. Haroun was very angry, and, on Giafar's persisting in
what he had said, had the vizier arrested, and finally resolved
to go to Basra to see with his own eyes: if Giafar should have
spoken the truth, he should be rewarded, but in the other event
be should forfeit his life.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_024','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>This story, it is true, shows no trace of the gabs which
Charlemagne and the peers make, and which Hugo requires to be
accomplished on pain of death. The gabs are a well-known
North-European custom, and need not be sought for further; but
the requiring by one king of certain feats to be executed by
another under a heavy penalty is a feature of a large class of
Eastern tales of which there has already been occasion to speak:
see '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_2.html">The Elfin Knight</a>,' p. 11. The demand in these, however, is
made not in person, but through an ambassador. The combination of
a personal visit with a task to be performed under penalty of
death is seen in the Vaf&thorn;r&uacute;&eth;nism&aacute;l, where
Odin, disguised as a traveller, seeks a contest in knowledge with
the wisest of the giants.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_025','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>The story of the gabs has been retold in two modern
imitations: very indifferently by Nivelle de la Chauss&eacute;e,
'Le Roi Hugon,' &OElig;uvres, t. V, suppl&eacute;ment, p. 66, ed.
1778, and well by M.J. Ch&eacute;nier, 'Les Miracles,' III, 259,
ed. 1824.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d030_026','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Uhland treated the subject dramatically in a
