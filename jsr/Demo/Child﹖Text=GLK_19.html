<h3>19. King Orfeo</h3>

<p>Mr. Edmonston, from whose memory this ballad was derived,
notes that though stanzas are probably lost after the first,
which would give some account of the king in the east wooing the
lady in the west, no such verses were sung to him. He had
forgotten some stanzas after the fourth, of which the substance
was that the lady was carried off by fairies, that the king went
in quest of her, and one day saw a company passing along a
hillside, among whom he recognized his lost wife. The troop went
to what seemed a great "ha-house," or castle, on the hillside.
Stanzas after the eighth were also forgotten, the purport being
that a messenger from behind the grey stane appeared and invited
the king in.</p>

<p>We have here in traditional song the story of the medieval
romance of Orpheus, in which fairy-land supplants Tartarus,
faithful love is rewarded, and Eurydice (Heurodis, Erodys,
Eroudys) is retrieved. There are three versions of this tale
(edited respectively by Laing, Select Remains of the Ancient
Popular Poetry of Scotland, No. 3; Halliwell, Illustrations of
Fairy Mythology, p. 37; and Ritson, Metrical Romancees, n, 248).
See the critical edition by O. Zielke, Breslau, 1880.</p>
