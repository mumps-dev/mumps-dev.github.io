<h3>The Lady of Arngosk</h3>


<ol type="A">
<li>Sharpe's Ballad Book, 1823, p. 99. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d22401.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>"The following fragment," says Sharpe in his preface (he had
not then recovered the second stanza), "I cannot illustrate
either from history or tradition." Very soon after the
publication of the Ballad Book, full particulars of the carrying
off of the Lady of Arngosk were procured for him by David
Webster, the bookseller. Webster addressed himself to Mrs.
Isobell Dow, otherwise Mrs. Mac Leish, of Newburgh, Fife, whose
mother, he had learned, was waiting-maid to the lady at the time
of the rape. "In my very early years," he wrote, July 4, 1823, "I
have listened with great delight to my mother when she sung me a
song the first stanza of which was this:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right">&nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>The Highlandmen are a' cum down,<br/>
They 're a' cum down almost,<br/>
They 've stowen awa the bonny lass,<br/>
The lady of Arngosk.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>"Now Miss Finlay informs me that Isobel Stewart, your mother,
was waiting-maid to the 'bonny lass' at the time she was 'stowen
awa,' and that you are the most likely person now alive who will
be able to recollect the song, or the particulars that gave rise
to it. My reason for requesting this favour from a lady I have
not the pleasure to know is, some gentlemen, my acquaintance, are
making a collection of old Scots songs, which is print ing, and
they are anxious to have it as full as possible. We therefore
wish a copy of the song entire, if you can recollect it, and the
name of the lady who was the 'bonny lass,'" etc. Mrs. Dow
replied, July 8, through John Masterton, that she was " sorrow "
to say that she could not recollect more of the song than Webster
was already in possession of, but the story she could never
forget, having heard her mother repeat it so often: and this
story Masterton proceeds to give in Mrs. Dow's own words.
Although Mrs. Dow was liberal of details, Webster seems to have
wanted to hear more, and accordingly Masterton writes at greater
length July 30, repeating what had been said before, with "some
particular incidents" omitted in the former letter, but nothing
very material except that Miss Gibb was rich, and that Isobell
Dow had "brought to her recolection another verse of the song"
(st. 2). The earlier letter even is somewhat out of proportion to
so meagre a relic of verse, an intolerable deal of bread to a
half-penny worth of sack; but it is very readable, and has some
value as a chapter from domestic life in Scotland in the first
half of the last century.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d224_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Dear Sir. I am directed by Isobell Dow to acknowledge the
receipt of your letter, and to write you an answer to your
request respecting the stealing awa the Lady of Arngosk. She is
sorrow to say she cannot recolect any more of the song than what
you are in possession off already. As for the truth of the story,
she can never forget, having heard her mother repeat it so often.
I will therefore give you it in her own words.</p>

<p>My mother was waiting-maid to the Lady of Arngask, whose name
was Miss Margret Gibb, at which time two gentlemen paid addresses
to her; the one a Mr. Jamieson, a writer in Strathmiglo, the
other a Mr. Graham, of Bracko Castle, who was the subject of the
story; but his love did not meet with a return suitable to his
wishes; he therefore came to the strong resolution of taking her
away by force. It will be proper to mention that he came two
nights previous, when my mother was in the barn dighting corn,
and accosted her thus: Tiby, I want to see Margret She answerd: I
doubt, Mr. Graham, you canna see her the night, but I'll gang an
tell her. She went and was orderd to tell him that he could not
see her; which put him in such a frenzy that he ran up and down
the barn through chaff and corn up to the middle; however, he
forced in to her company, but what passed be twixt them my mother
did not know. But on the second night after, at midnight, when in
bed (my mother alway sleeping with Miss Gibb),<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d224_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> a very sharp
knock was heard at the door, which alarmd them very much, it
being a lonely place. My mother went and called, who was there;
she was answered, Open the door, Tiby, and see. She said: Keep
me! Mr. Graham, what way are you here at this time? Ye canna won
in the night. She drew the bar, and was almost frighted out of
her sences by the appearance of above thirty Hillandmen on
horseback, all armed with swords and dirks, &amp;c. She atempted
to shut the door again, but Mr. Graham pressed his knee in and
forced his way. He went ben, and ordered them to put on their
clothes an go along with him. Miss Gibb insisted on stoping ere
daylight, and she would go with good will; but he would admit of
no delay, but ordered her to dress herself imediately, otherwise
he would do it by force. She then said she would not go unless
Tiby acompanied her, which he said he intended to propose had she
not mentioned it; but my mother would not go, she said, to ride
behind none of these Hillandmen. Mr. Graham then proposed to take
her behind himself. They did then all mount; he at the same time
used the precaution of placing sentries on the houses where the
other servants lodged, to prevent them giving the alarm, and also
three stout men at the bell of the church, to prevent it being
rung. They kept their posts till they thought them a sufficient
distance on the way, Mr. Graham always joking to my mother about
something or other, asuring her so soon as he had all over he
would make her happy and comfortable all the days of her life.
They rode on over hill and dale till within sight of Bracko
Castle, when all of a sudden the Hillanmen dispersed, or deserted
them, excepting his own imediate servants; which my mother
thought was because he had deceived them, saying that the lady
was willing to marry him but her friends would not alow, which by
this time they must have found out. He told my mother that a
minister was waiting them at Bracko, but he must have been
disappointed, for the minister never appeared; else, she always
thought, they would been married. Report said that Mr. Jamieson
had so contrived to stop his arrival. My mother and Miss Margret
were then secured in an uper room in the castle till the next
day, when there appeared mostly all the men of the parishes of
Arngask and Strathmiglo, demanding their lady; my father among
the rest, demanding my mother as his intended wife. It seemed so
soon as the Hillan sentries were gone from the houses and
church-bell of Arngask, that the servants ran to the bell, and
rang such a peal as made all the Ochles resound wi the sad news
that their lady was stowen awa by Graham an his clan. Mr.
Jamieson was no less busy in alarming and rousing the indignation
of the good folk of Strathmiglo, who were much atached to her
interest, so that both parishes rose to a man, and armed
themselves with whatever came in the way, and marched in a body
to make an attack on the castle, and rescue their much esteemed
lady. But on their making their appearance before the castle in
such formidable array, Mr. Graham thought it prudent to surender
rather than sustain the attack of such a body of desperate men.
Mr. Graham conducted them down stairs with his cap in hand (the
gentlemen in those days wore velvet caps), and addressed her
thus: I shall see you on your horse, Margret, for a' the ill you
've done me, and bade her a long and last ing farewell; at which
she stamped with her foot and recommended him to the devil. They
all came home in safety, and the bells, that so lately rang to
alarm and spread the dismal news, were again rung to proclaim the
happy return of the lady that was stowen awa. Bonelires were also
erected on the highest of the Ochles. She was married that same
year to Mr. Jamieson, and I suppose some of their children are
alive to this day. It was generaly reported that Mr. Graham was
so much affronted at the dissapointment that he left the country
soon after.</p>

<p>Such, sir, is the story that gave rise to the song 
you are so much in request off, which I have gathered from Isobell Dow, and put in order according 
to my weak capacity, knowing it will fall into better and abler hands, and that, altho the song be a 
wanting, there is ample mater for composition. 
I remain your most Obed<sup>t</sup> H<sup>le</sup> 
Serv<sup>t</sup>,</p> 

<p>John Masterton, for Isobell Dow.</p>

<p>P.S. I had almost forgot to mention as to the period of time
when it happened, which cannot be less than 87 years, which
Isobell makes out in the following mauer; it being two years
before her father and mother was married, and that they lived
together fifty-one years, it being now thirty-four years since
her mother died, which makes it to have been about the year
1736.</p>
