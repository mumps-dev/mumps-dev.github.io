</ol>

<p>All the known copies of this ballad are recent. It is not in
Thackeray's list of broadsides, which dates perhaps as late as
1689 (Chappell, The Roxburghe Ballads, I, xxiv-xxvii); and it is
not included in the collection of 1723-25, which showed
particular favor to historical pieces. In a manuscript index of
first lines to a large collection of songs and ballads "formed in
1748," I find, "As our king lay on his bed," and the ballad may
probably have first been published in the second quarter of the
last century. In a woodcut below the title of <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>,
there are two soldiers with G R on the flap of the coat and G on
the cap (no doubt in <b>c</b> as well); the date of these
broadsides cannot therefore be earlier than the accession of
George I, 1714. The broadside is in a popular manner, but has no
mark of antiquity. It may, however, represent an older ballad,
disfigured by some purveyor for the Aldermary press.</p>

<p>It is probable that the recited versions had their ultimate
source in print, and that printed copies were in circulation
which, besides the usual slight variations,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d164_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> contained two
more stanzas, one after 2 and another after 8, such as are found
in h and elsewhere; which stanzas are likely to have formed part
of the original matter.</p>

<p>After 2, <b>h</b> (see also <b>g</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>j</b>):</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Tell him to send me my tribute home,<br/>

</table>

<p>After 8, <b>h</b> (see also <b>g</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>k</b>, 
<b>m</b>):</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>then bespoke our noble king,<br/>

As in French lands he neer did see!</td></tr>

</table>

<p><b>g</b> has several stanzas which are due to the 
hand of some improver.</p>

<p>Another, and much more circumstantial, ballad on Agincourt,
written from the chronicles, was current in the seventeenth
century. It begins, 'A councell braue [grave] our king did hold,'
and may be seen in the Percy Manuscript, p. 241, Hales and
Furnivall, II, 166, in The Crown Garland of Golden Roses (with
seven stanzas fewer), ed. 1659, p. 65 of the reprint by the Percy
Society, vol. xv; Pepys' Ballads, I, 90, No 44; Old Ballads, II,
79; Pills to purge Melancholy, V, 49; etc.</p>

<p>The story of the Tennis-Balis is not mentioned by the French
historians, by Walsingham, Titus Livius, or the anonymous
biographer of Henry in Cotton Manuscript, Julius E. iv.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d164_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It
occurs, however, in several contemporary writings, as in Elmham's
Liber Metricus de Henrico Quinto, cap. xii (Quod filius regis
Francorum, in derisum, misit domino regi pilas, quibus valeret
cum pueris ludere potius quam pugnare, etc.), Cole, Memorials of
Henry the Fifth, 1858, p. 101; but not in Elmham's prose history.
So in Capgrave, De illustribus Henricis, with a <i>fertur</i>, ed.
Hingeston, 1858, p. 114; but not in Capgrave's chronicle. We
might infer, in these two cases, that the tale was thought good
enough for verses and good enough for eulogies, though not good
enough for history.</p>

<p>Again, in verses of Harleian Manuscript 565, "in a hand of the
fifteenth century," the Dolphin says to the English
ambassadors:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Me thinke youre kyng he is nought [so] old<br/>
No werrys for to maynteyn.<br/>
Grete well youre kyng, he seyde, so yonge,<br/>
That is both gentill and small;<br/>
A tonne of tenys-ballys I shall hym sende,<br/>
For hym to pleye with all.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Henry sends back this message:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Oure Cherlys of Fraunce gret well or ye wende,<br/>
The Dolfyn prowed withinne his wall;<br/>
Swyche tenys-ballys I schal hym sende<br/>
As schall tere the roof all of his [h]all.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d164_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></td></tr>

</table>

<p>But there is a chronicler who has the tale still. Otterbourne
writes: Eodem anno [1414], in quadragesima, rege existente apud
Kenilworth, Karolus, regis Francorum filius, Delphinus vocatus,
misit pilas Parisianas ad ludendum cum pueris. Cui rex Anglorum
rescripsit, dicens se in brevi pilas missurum Londoniarum, quibus
terreret et confunderet sua tecta.</p>

<p>And once more, the author of an inedited "Chronicle of King
Henry the Fifth that was Kyng Henries son," Cotton Manuscript,
Claudius A. viii, of the middle of the fifteenth century, fol. 1,
back:<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d164_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>And than, the Dolphine of Fraunce aunswered to our
embassatours, and said in this maner, 'that the kyng was ouer
yong and to tender of age to make any warre ayens hym, and was
not lyke yet to be noo good werrioure to doo and to make suche a
conquest there vpon hym. And somwhat in scorne and dispite he
sente to hym a tonne fulle of tenysballis, be-cause he wolde haue
some-what for to play wit<i>h</i>alle for hym and for his lordis,
and that be-came hym better than to mayntayn any werre. And than
anone oure lordes that was embassatours token hir leue and comen
in to England ayenne, and tolde the kyng and his counceille of
the vn-goodly aunswer that they had of the Dolphyn, and of the
present the whiche he had sent vnto the kyng. And whan the kyng
had hard her wordis, and the answere of the Dolp[h]ynne, he was
wondre sore agreued, and righte euelle apayd towarde the
Frensshemen, and toward the kyng, and the Dolphynne, and thoughte
to auenge hym vpon hem as sone as God wold send hym grace and
myghte; and anon lette make tenys-ballis for the Dolp[h]ynne in
all the hast that the myghte be made, and they were grete
gonne-stones for the Dolp[h]ynne to play wythe-alle.'</p>

<p>The Dolphin, whom two of these writers make talk of Henry as
if he were a boy, was himself in his nineteenth year, and the
English king more than eight years his senior. "Hume has justly
observed," says Sir Harris Nicolas, "that the great offers made
by the French monarch, however inferior to Henry's demands, prove
that it was his wish rather to appease than exasperate him; and
it is almost incredible that, whilst the advisers of Charles
evinced so much forbearance, his son should have offered Henry a
personal insult... It should be observed, as additional grounds
for doubting that the message or gift was sent by the Dauphin,
that such an act must have convinced both parties of the
hopelessness of a pacific arrangement afterwards, and would, it
may be imagined, have equally prevented the French court and
Henry from seeking any other means of ending the dispute than by
the sword. This, however, was not the case; for even supposing
that the offensive communication was made on the occasion of the
last, instead ... of that of the first embassy, it is certain
that overtures were again sent to Henry whilst he was on his
journey to the place of embarkation, and that even when there, he
wrote to the French monarch with the object of adjusting his
claims without a recourse to arms: " pp. 9, 12 f.</p>

<p>History repeats itself. Darius writes to Alexander as if he
were a boy, and sends him, with other things, a ball to play
with; and Alexander, in his reply to Darius, turns the tables
upon the Persian king by his interpretation of the insolent
gifts: Pseudo-Callisthenes, I, 36, ed. M&uuml;ller, p. 40 f.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d164_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
The parallel is close. It is not inconceivable that the English
story is borrowed, but I am not prepared to maintain this.</p>

<p>It does not appear from any testimony external to the ballad
that married men or widows' sons had the benefit of an exemption
in the levy for France, or that Cheshire, Lancashire, and
Derby<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d164_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> were particularly called upon to furnish men: st. 9.
The Rev. J. Endell Tyler believes the ballad to be unquestionably
of ancient origin, "probably written and sung within a very few
years of the expedition," "before Henry's death, and just after
his marriage;" which granted, this stanza would have a certain
interest. But, says Mr. Tyler, "whether there is any foundation
at all in fact for the tradition of Henry's resolution to take
with him no married man or widow's son, the tradition itself
bears such strong testimony to the general estimate of Henry's
character for bravery at once and kindness of heart that it would
be unpardonable to omit every reference to it," and he has both
printed the ballad in the body of his work and placed "that
golden stanza" on his title-page.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d164_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The question of Henry's
kindness of heart does not require to be discussed here, but it
may be said in passing that there is not quite enough in this
ballad to remove the impression which is ordinarily made by his
conduct of the siege of Rouen.</p>

<p>The Battle of Agincourt was fought October 25, 1415. It is
hardly necessary to say, with reference to the marching to Paris
gates, that Henry had the wisdom to evacuate French ground as
soon after the battle as convoy to England could be procured.</p>
