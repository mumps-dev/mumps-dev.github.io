<h3>162. The Hunting of the Cheviot</h3>

<p>The 'Hunttis of Chevet' is among the "sangis of natural music
of the antiquite" mentioned as sung by the "shepherds" in The
Complaynte of Scotlande, 1549. It was an old and a popular song
at the middle of the sixteenth century. <b>A</b>, the copy in the
Ashmolean manuscript, is subscribed 'Expliceth, quod Rychard
Sheale,' upon which ground Sheale has been held to be the author,
and not, as Percy and Ritson assumed, simply the transcriber, of
the ballad. Sheale describes himself as a minstrel living at
Tamworth, whose business was to 'sing and talk,' or to chant
ballads and tell stories. He was the author of four pieces of
verse in the same manuscript, one of which is of the date 1559.
This and another piece, in which he tells how he was robbed of
above threescore pound, give a sufficient idea of his dialect and
style and a measure of his ability. This ballad was of course
part of his stock as minstrel; the supposition that he was the
author is preposterous in the extreme.</p>

<p>'The Battle of Otterburn' (No, 161) and 'The Hunting of the
Cheviot' appear to be founded upon the same occurrence, 'The
Hunting of the Cheviot' being the later of the two, and following
in part its own tradition, though repeating some portions of the
older ballad. The grammatical forms of <b>A</b> are, however,
earlier than those of the particular copy of 'The Battle of
Otterburn' which has been preserved. Sidney's well-known words
may apply either to 'Otterburn' or to the present ballad:
"Certainly I must confesse my own barbarousnes, I never heard the
olde song of Percy and Duglas, that I found not my heart mooued
more then with a Trumpet," etc. (Apologie for Poetrie, ed. Arber,
p. 46).</p>

<p><b>B</b> is a striking but by no means a solitary example of
the impairment which an old ballad would suffer when written over
for the broadside press. This very seriously enfeebled edition
was in circulation throughout the seventeenth century, and much
sung (says Chappell) despite its length. It is declared by
Addison, in his appreciative and tasteful critique (Spectator,
Nos. 70, 74, 1711), to be the favorite ballad of the common
people of England. Addison, who knew no other version, informs us
that Ben Jonson used to say that he had rather have been the
author of Chevy Chase than of all his works. The broadside copy
may possibly have been the only one known to Jonson also, but in
all probability the traditional ballad was still sung in the
streets in Jonson's youth, if not later.</p>
