</ol>

<p>Also Pepys, II, 122, No 107, by Alexander Milbourne (1670-97):
Old Ballads, 1723, II, 39.</p>

<p><b>a</b> is printed in Ritson's Robin Hood, 1795, II, 19.
Evans, Old Ballads, 1777, 1784, I, 102, apparently follows the
Aldermary Churchyard garland.</p>

<p>Robin Hood, while ranging the forest, sees a bishop and all
his men coming, and, knowing that if he is taken no mercy will be
given him, asks the help of an old woman, to whom he makes
himself known. The old woman has had a kindness from him, and
wishes to return it. She consents to exchange her gray coat and
spindle for his green mantle and arrows, and Robin makes for his
band in this disguise. The bishop carries off the old woman on a
horse, making no doubt that he has Robin in custody, but, as he
proceeds through the wood, sees a hundred bowmen, and asks his
prisoner what this may be. I think it be Robin Hood, says the
supposed outlaw. "And who are you?" "Why, I am an old woman." The
bishop turns about, but Robin stays him, ties him to a tree,
takes five hundred pound from his portmantle, and then is willing
he should go. But Little John will not let him off till he has
sung a mass; after which the bishop is mounted on his
dapple-gray, with his face to the tail, and told to pray for
Robin Hood.</p>

<p>This ballad and the following are variations upon the theme of
Robin Hood and the Monk, in the Gest. The disguise as a woman
occurs in other outlaw stories; as in Eustace the Monk, Michel,
p. 43. Also in Blind Harry's Wallace, ed. Moir, Book I, 239, and
Book IV, 764, pp 9, 72: in the first case Wallace has a rock and
sits spinning. See also the ballad of Gude Wallace, further
on.</p>

<p>We hear again of the forced mass, st. 23, in Robin Hood and
Queen Katherine, <b>A</b> 31, <b>B</b> 40; and of money borrowed
against the bishop's will, in <b>A</b> 32 of the same. It is the
Bishop of Hereford who suffers: see the ballad which follows.</p>

<p>Translated by Doenniges, p. 203; Anastasius Gr&uuml;n, p. 
113.</p>
