<h3>12. Lord Randal</h3>

<p>P. 151.</p>

<p><b>B</b>. Add: Kinloch Manuscripts, VII, 89.</p>

<p><b>D</b>. Read: <b>a</b>. 'Lord Randal,' Minstrelsy, 
etc.<br/>
<b>b</b>. 'Lord Rannal,' Campbell Manuscripts, II, 269.</p>

<p><b>I</b>. Add: <b>h</b>. Communicated by Mr. George M. 
Richardson.<br/>
<b>i</b>. Communicated by Mr. George L. Kittredge.</p>

<p><b>K</b>. <b>b</b>. Insert after Popular Rhymes: 1826, p. 
295.<br/>
Add: <b>d</b>. 'The Crowdin Dou,' Kinloch Manuscripts, I, 
184.</p>

<p>Add: <b>P</b>. 'Lord Ronald, my son,' communicated by Mr.
Macmath, of Edinburgh.</p>

<p><b>Q</b>. 'Lord Randal,' Pitcairn's Manuscripts, III, 19.</p>

<p><b>R</b>. 'Little wee toorin dow,' Pitcairn's Manuscripts,
III, 13, from tradition.</p>

<p>153 a. I failed to mention, though I had duly noted them,
three versions of 'L'Avvelenato,' which are cited by Professor
D'Ancona in his Poesia popolare Italiana, pp 106 ff.</p>

<p><b>D</b>. The Canon Lorenzo Panciatichi refers to the ballad
in a 'Cicalata in lode della Padella e della Frittura,' recited
at the Crusca, September 24, 1656, and in such manner as shows
that it was well known. He quotes the first question of the
mother, "Dove andast&ugrave; a cena," etc. To this the son
answered, he says, that he had been poisoned with a roast eel:
and the mother asking what the lady had cooked it in, the reply
was, In the oil pot.</p>

<p><b>E</b>. A version obtained by D'Ancona from the singing of a
young fellow from near Pisa, of which the first four stanzas are
given. Some verses after these are lost, for the testament is
said to supervene immediately.</p>

<p><b>F</b>. A version from Lecco, which has the title, derived
from its burden, 'De lu cavalieri e figliu de re,' A. Trifone
Nutricati Briganti, Intorno ai Canti e Racconti popolari del
Leccese, p. 17. The first four stanzas are cited, and it appears
from these that the prince had cooked the eel himself, and,
appropriately, in a gold pan.</p>

<p>154 a, first paragraph. <b>F</b> is given by Meltzl, Acta
Comparationis, 1880, columns 143 f, in another dialect.</p>

<p>154 b. <b>Magyar</b>. The original of this ballad, 'A
meg&eacute;tett J&aacute;nos,' 'Poisoned John' (as would appear,
in the Szekler idiom), was discovered by the Unitarian bishop
Kriza, of Klausenburg, and was published by him in J. Arany's
'Koszoru,' in 1864. lt is more exactly translated by Meltzl in the
Acta Comparationis Litterarum Universarum, 1880, VII, columns 30
f, the original immediately preceding. Aigner has omitted the
second stanza, and made the third into two, in his translation.
The Szekler has ten two-line stanzas, with the burden, Ah, my
bowels are on fire! Ah, make ready my bed! In the second stanza
John says he has eaten a four-footed crab; in the sixth he leaves
his elder brother his yoke of oxen; in the seventh he leaves his
team of four horses to his younger brother. Also translated in
Ungarische Revue, 1883, p. 139, by G. Heinrich.</p>

<p><b>B</b>, another Szekler version, taken down by Meltzl from
the mouth of a girl, is in seven two-line stanzas, with the
hurden, Make my bed, sweet mother! 'J&aacute;nos,' Acta, cols 140
f, with a German translation. John has been at his
sister-in-law's, and had a stuffed chicken and a big cake. At his
elder sister's they gave him the back of the axe, bloody stripes.
He bequeaths to his elder sister remorse and sickness; to bis
sister-in-law six oxen and his wagon; to his father illness and
poverty; to his mother kindness and beggary.</p>

<p>156 b, second paragraph. Polish: add Roger, p. 66, No 119. Add
further: Little Russian, Golovatsky, Part I, pp 206, 207, 209,
Nos 32, 33, 35. Masovian, Kozlowski, No 14, p. 52, p. 53.
(Sacharof, IV, 7 = &#268;elakovsk&yacute;, III, 108.)</p>

<p>157 a, second paragraph. Kaden translates Nannarelli, p. 52. 
(K&ouml;hler.)</p>

<p>157 b. Italian <b>A</b> is translated by Evelyn Carrington in
The Antiquary, III, 156 f. <b>D</b> also by Freiligrath, II, 226,
ed. Stuttgart, 1877.</p>

<p>158 a. <b>B</b>. Found in Kinloch Manuscripts, VII, 89. The
sixth stanza is not there, and was probably taken from Scott,
