</ol>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to remark that this ballad, like too
many others, has suffered severely by the accidents of tradition.
<b>A</b> has been not simply damaged by passing through low
mouths, but has been worked over by low hands. Something
considerable has been lost from the story, and fine romantic
features, preserved in Norse and German ballads, have been quite
effaced.</p>

<p>Margaret, a king's daughter, <b>A</b>, an earl's daughter,
<b>B</b>, a lady of noble birth, <b>C</b>, as she sits sewing in
her bower door, hears a note in Elmond's wood and wishes herself
there, <b>A</b>. The wood is Amon-shaw in <b>C</b>, Mulberry in
<b>B</b>; the Elmond (Amond, Elfman?) is probably significant. So
far the heroine resembles Lady Isabel in No 4, who, sewing in her
bower, hears an elf-horn, and cannot resist the enchanted tone.
Margaret makes for the wood as fast as she can go. The note that
is heard in <b>A</b> is mistaken in <b>B</b> for <i>nuts</i>:
Margaret, as she stands in her bower door, spies some nuts
growing in the wood, and wishes herself there. Arrived at the
wood, Margaret, in <b>A</b> as well as <b>B</b>, immediately
takes to pulling nuts.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d041_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The lady is carried off in <b>C</b>
under cover of a magical mist, and the hero in all is no ordinary
hind.</p>

<p>Margaret has hardly pulled a nut, when she is confronted by
young Akin, <b>A</b>, otherwise, and correctly, called Etin in
<b>B</b>, a hind of giant strength in both, who accuses her of
trespassing, and stops her. Akin pulls up the highest tree in the
wood and builds a bower, in visible to passers-by, for their
habitation. <b>B</b>, which recognizes no influence of
enchantment upon the lady's will, as found in <b>A</b>, and no
prepossession on her part, as in <b>C</b>, makes Hind Etin pull
up the biggest tree in the forest as well, but it is to scoop out
a cave many fathoms deep, in which he confines Margaret till she
comes to terms, and consents to <i>go home</i> with him, wherever
that may be. Hastings, another corruption of Etin, carries off
the lady on his horse to the wood, "where again their loves are
sworn," and there they take up their abode in a cave of stone,
<b>C</b> 9. Lady Margaret lives with the etin seven years, and
bears him seven sons, <b>A</b> 9; many years, and bears seven
sons, <b>B</b>; ten years, and bears seven bairns, <b>C</b> 6, 8,
9.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d041_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Once upon a time the etin goes hunting,
<a name="Page_I_361"/>
and takes his eldest
boy with him. The boy asks his father why his motber is so often
in tears, and the father says it is because she was born of high
degree, but had been stolen by him; "is wife of Hynde Etin, wha
ne'er got christendame," <b>B</b> 15. The etin, who could pull
the highest tree in the wood up by the roots, adds in <b>A</b> 15
that when he stole his wife he was her father's cup-bearer! and
that he caught her "on a misty night," which reminds us of the
mist which Young Hastings, "the groom," cast before the lady's
attendants when he carried her off.</p>

<p>The next time Akin goes hunting he leaves his young comrade
behind, and the boy tells his mother that he heard "fine music
ring" when he was coming home, on the other occasion. She wishes
she had been there. He takes his motber and six brothers, and
they make their way through the wood at their best speed, not
knowing in what direction they are going. But luckily they come to
the gate of the king, the father and grandfather of the band. The
mother sends her eldest boy in with three rings, to propitiate
the porter, the butler-boy, who acts as usher in this particular
palace, and the minstrel who plays before the king. His majesty
is so struck with the resemblance of the boy to his daughter that
he is blinded with tears. The boy informs his grandfather that
his mother is standing at the gates, with six more brothers, and
the king orders that she be admitted. He asks her to dine, but
she can touch nothing till she has seen her mother and sister.
Admitted to her mother, the queen in turn says, You will dine
with me; but she can touch nothing till she has seen her sister.
Her sister, again, invites her to dine, but now she can touch
nothing till she has seen her "dear husband." Rangers are sent
into the wood to fetch Young Akin, under promise of a full
pardon. He is found tearing his yellow hair. The king now asks
Akin to dine with him, and there appears to have been a family
dinner. While this is going on the boy expresses a wish to be
christened, "to get christendoun;" in all his eight years he had
never been in a church. The king promises that he shall go that
very day with his mother, and all seven of the boys seem to have
got their christendoun; and so, we may hope, did Hind Etin, who
was, if possible, more in want of it than they; <b>B</b> 15,
19.</p>

<p>In this story <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> pretty nearly agree.
<b>C</b> has nothing of the restoration of the lady to her
parents and home. The mother, in this version, having harped her
seven bairns asleep, sits down and weeps bitterly. She wishes,
like Fair Annie, that they were rats, and she a cat, to eat them
one and all. She has lived ten years in a stone cave, and has
never had a churching. The eldest boy suggests that they shall
all go to some church: they be christened and she be churched.
This is accomplished without any difficulty, and, as the tale
stands, we can only wonder that it had not been attempted
before.</p>

<p>The etin of the Scottish story is in Norse and German a
dwarf-king, elf-king, hill-king, or even a merman. The ballad is
still sung in Scandinavia and Germany, but only the Danes have
versions taken down before the present century.</p>

<p><b>Danish</b> <b>A</b>, one of the three sixteenth-century
versions, tells how a knight, expressing a strong desire to
obtain a king's daughter, is overheard by a dwarf, who says this
shall never be. The dwarf pretends to bargain with the knight for
his services in forwarding the knight's object, but consults
meanwhile with his mother how he may get the lady for
himself.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d041_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The mother tells him that the princess will go to
even-song, and the dwarf writes runes on the way she must go by,
which compel her to come to the hill. The dwarf holds out his
hand and asks, How came ye to this strange land? to which tbe
lady answers mournfully, I wot never how. The dwarf says, You
have pledged yourself to a knight, and he has betrayed you with
runes: this eve you shall be the dwarf's guest. She stayed there
the night, and was taken back to her mother in the morning. Eight
years went by; her hand was sought by five kings, nine counts,
but no one of them could get a good answer. One day her mother
asked, Why are thy cheeks so faded? Why can no one get thee? She
then revealed that she had been beguiled by the dwarf, and had
seven sons and a daughter in the hill, none of whom she ever saw.
She thought she was alone, but the dwarf-king was listening. He
strikes her with an elf-rod, and bids her hie to the hill after
him. Late in the evening the poor thing dons her cloak, knocks at
her father's door, and says good-night to the friend that never
will see her again, then sadly turns to the hill. Her seven sons
advance to meet her, and ask why she told of their father. Her
tears run sore; she gives no answer; she is dead ere midnight.</p>

<p>With <b>A</b> agrees another of the three old Danish copies,
<b>B</b>, and three modern ones, <b>D</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>,
have something of the opening scene which characterizes <b>A</b>.
So also Swedish <b>C</b>, <b>I</b>, and the Icelandic ballad. In
Swedish <b>C</b>, Proud Margaret, who is daughter of a king of
seven kingdoms, will have none of her suitors (this
<a name="Page_I_363"/>
circumstance
comes too soon). A hill-king asks his mother how he may get her.
She asks in return, What will you give me to make her come of
herself to the hill? He promises red gold and chestfuls of pence;
and one Sunday morning Margaret, who has set out to go to church,
is made &mdash; by magical operations, of course &mdash; to take
the way to the hill.</p>

<p><b>A</b> second form begins a stage later: Danish <b>C</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>K</b>, Swedish <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>K</b>,
Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>,
<b>I</b> (?), <b>K</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b> (7) <b>N</b> (?),
F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. We learn nothing of the
device by which the maid has been entrapped. Mother and daughter
are sitting in their bower, and the mother asks her child why her
cheeks are pale, why milk is running from her breasts. She
answers that she has been working too hard; that what is taken
for milk is mead. The mother retorts that other women do not
suffer from their industry; that mead is brown, and milk is
white. Hereupon the daughter reveals that she has been beguiled
by an elf, and, though living under her mother's roof, has had
eight or nine children (seven or eight sons and a daughter;
fifteen children, F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>), none of
whom she ever saw, since after birth they were always transferred
to the hill (see, especially, Danish <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, also
<b>A</b>; Norwegian <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>; F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>) . The mother (who disowns her, Danish <b>C</b>,
<b>G</b>, Swedish <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, Norwegian <b>K</b>), in
several versions, asks what gifts she got for her honor. Among
these was a harp [horn, Norwegian <b>L</b>], which she was to
play when she was unhappy. The mother asks for a piece, and the
first tones bring the elf, who reproaches the daughter for
betraying him: had she concealed their connection she might still
have lived at home, <b>C</b>; but now she must go with him. She
is kindly received by her children. They give her a drink which
makes her forget father and mother, heaven and earth, moon and
sun, and even makes her think she was born in the hill, Danish
<b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, Swedish <b>D</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d041_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Danish <b>G</b>, <b>K</b>, F&auml;r&ouml;e <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
take a tragic turn: the woman dies in the first two the night she
comes to the hill. Danish <b>C</b>, one of the sixteenth-century
versions, goes as far as possible in the other direction. The
elf-king pats Maldfred's cheek, take her in his arms, gives her a
queen's crown and name.</p>

<p>And this he did for the lily-wand,<br/>
He had himself christened and all his land!</p>

<p>A third series of versions offers the probable type of the
much-corrupted Scottish ballads, and under this head come Danish
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>-<b>R</b>,
<b>T</b>; Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>-<b>I</b>, and also
<b>C</b>, after an introduction which belongs to the first class;
Norwegian <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>. The characteristic feature is that
the woman has been living eight or nine years in the hill, and
has there borne her children, commonly seven sons and a daughter.
She sets out to go to matins, and whether under the influence of
runes, or accidentally, or purposely, takes the way to the hill.
In a few cases it is clear that she does not seek the hill-man or
put herself in his way, e.g., Danish <b>N</b>, Swedish <b>G</b>,
but Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>N</b> make her apply for
admission at the hill-door. In Danish <b>I</b>,
<b>N</b>-<b>R</b>, <b>T</b>, Norwegian <b>F</b>, it is not said
that she was on her way to church; she is in a field or in the
hill. In Swedish <b>F</b> she has been two years in the cave, and
it seems to her as if she had come yesterday. After her eight or
nine years with the hill-man the woman longs to go home, Danish
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>I</b>, Norwegian <b>D</b>; to go to church, Danish <b>L</b>,
<b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>T</b>, Norwegian <b>F</b>; for
she had heard Denmark's bells, church bells, Danish
<b>L</b>-<b>P</b>, <b>T</b>, Swedish <b>G</b>, Norwegian
<a name="Page_I_364"/>
<b>D</b>, <b>F</b>. She had heard these bells as she watched the
cradle, Danish <b>T</b>, <b>P</b>, Swedish <b>G</b>; sat by the
cradle and sang, <b>T</b> 4; compare English <b>C</b> 7. She asks
the hill-man's permission, and it is granted on certain terms:
she is not to talk of him and her life in the hill, Danish
<b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>I</b>, is to
come back, Danish <b>F</b>, must not stay longer than an hour or
two, Norwegian <b>D</b>; she is not to wear her gold, her best
clothes, not to let out her hair, not to go into her mother's pew
at the church, not to bow when the priest pronounces the holy
name, or make an offering, or go home after service, etc., Danish
<b>I</b>, <b>L</b>-<b>P</b>, <b>T</b>, Norwegian <b>F</b>. All
these last conditions she violates, nor does she in the least
heed the injunction not to speak of the hill-man. The consequence
is that he summarily presents himself, whether at the church or
the paternal mansion, and orders her back to the hill, sometimes
striking her on the ear or cheek so that blood runs, or beating
her with a rod, Danish <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>,
<b>S</b>, <b>T</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, Norwegian <b>F</b>. In a few versions, the
hill-man tells her that her children are crying for her, and she
replies, Let them cry; I will never go back to the hill; Danish
<b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>O</b>, Norwegian <b>F</b>. In Danish
<b>E</b>, Swedisb <b>G</b>, a gold apple thrown into her lap
seems to compel her to return; more commonly main force is used.
She is carried dead into the hill, or dies immediately on her
arrival, in Norwegian <b>F</b>, Danish <b>T</b>; she dies of
grief, according to traditional comment, in Norwegian <b>D</b>.
They give her a drink, and her heart breaks, Swedish <b>A</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>M</b>; but elsewhere the drink only
induces forgetfulness, Danish <b>L</b>, <b>M</b>, Swedish
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>.</p>

<p>Much of the story of 'Jomfruen og Dv&aelig;gekongen' recurs in
the ballad of 'Agnete og Havmanden,' which, for our purposes, may
be treated as a simple variation of the other. The Norse forms
are again numerous, but all from broadsides dating, at most, a
century back, or from recent tradition.</p>

described at p. 818. <b>C</b>, Grundtvig, IV, 809, also more
Danish than Norwegian. All these communicated by Bugge.</p>

<p><b>Danish</b> <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, have a
hill-man instead of a merman, and might as well have been put
with the other ballad. On the other hand, the Danish versions
<b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>O</b> of 'The Maid and the Dwarf-King'
call the maid Agenet, and give the hill-man a name, Nek. Netmand,
Mekmand, which implies a watery origin for him, and the fragments
<b>P</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b> have similar names, Nekmand, Negen,
L&aelig;kkemand, as also Agenete, and might as well have been
ranked with 'Agnes and the Merman.' In 'The Maid and the
Dwarf-King,' Swedish <b>L</b> (one stanza) the maid is taken by
"Pel Elf-ven" to the sea.</p>

<p>Agnes goes willingly with the merman to the sea-bottom, Danish
<b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>K</b>, Swedish <b>A</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>. She lives
there, according to many versions, eight years, and has seven
children. As she is sitting and singing by the cradle one day,
she hears the bells of England, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>,
<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b> Swedish <b>D</b>
[church bells, bells, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>], Norwegian <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>. She asks if she may go to
<a name="Page_I_365"/>
church, go home, and receives
permission on the same terms as in the other ballad. Her mother
asks her what gifts she had received, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, Swedish <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>,
Norwegian <b>C</b>. When the merman comes into the church all the
images turn their backs, Danish <b>A</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>K</b>,
Swedish <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, Norwegian <b>A</b>,
<b>C</b>; and, in some cases, for Agnes, too. He tells her that
the children are crying for her; she refuses to go back, Danish
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>K</b>, Swedish
<b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b> (and apparently <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>C</b>), Norwegian <b>C</b>. In Norwegian <b>A</b> the merman
strikes her on the cheek, and she returns; in Danish <b>I</b> she
is taken back quietly; in Danish <b>C</b> he gives her so sore an
ail that she dies presently; in Danish <b>H</b> she is taken away
by force, and poisoned by her children; in Danish <b>K</b> the
merman says that if she stays with her mother they must divide
the children (five). He takes two, she two, and each has to take
half of the odd one.</p>

<p>The Norse forms of 'Agnes and the Merman' are conceded to have
been derived from Germany: see Grundtvig, IV, 812. Of the German
ballad, which is somewhat nearer to the English, the following
versions have been noted:</p>

Volkslieder in Anhalt-Dessau, p. 140, No 1 = Mittler, No 553.

<p>A wild merman has become enamored of the King of England's
daughter, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>. He plates a
bridge with gold; she often walks over the bridge; it sinks with
her into the water [the merman drags her down into the water,
<b>H</b>]. She stays below seven years, and bears seven sons. One
day [by the cradle, <b>C</b>, <b>G</b>] she hears the bells of
England, <b>A</b> 6, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>
[bells, <b>E</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>], and longs to go to church.
She expresses this wish to the merman, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. The merman says she must take her seven sons
with her, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>; she must come back,
<b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. She takes her seven sons by the hand, and
goes with them to England, <b>A</b> 5, <b>B</b> 7; cf. Scottish
<b>C</b> 13, 14, <b>A</b> 22, 50. When she enters the church
everything in it bows, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>F</b>. Her parents
are there, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>; her father opens the pew, her
mother lays a cushion for her, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. As she goes
out of the church, there stands the merman, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>,
<b>E</b>, <b>F</b>. Her parents take her home in <b>D</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. They seat her at the table, and while she is
eating, a gold apple falls into her lap (cf. 'The Maid and the
Dwarf-King,' Danish <b>E</b>, Swedish <b>G</b>), which she begs
her mother to throw into the fire; the merman appears, and asks
if she wishes him burnt, <b>G</b>, <b>H</b>. The merman, when he
presents himself at the church, asks whether the woman will go
back with him, or die where she is, and she prefers death on the
spot, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>. In the other case, be says
that if she will not return, the children must be divided,
&mdash; three and three, and half of the seventh to each; the
mother prefers the water to this. <b>D</b> has a peculiar and not
very happy trait. The merman fastens a chain to his wife's foot
before she goes up, and, baving been kept long waiting, draws it
in. But the people at the church have taken off the chain, and he
finds nothing at the end of it. He asks whether she does not wish
to live with him; she replies. I will no longer torment you, or
fret myself to death.</p>

<p>The story of Agnes and the Merman occurs in a Wendish ballad,
with an introductory scene found in the beautiful German ballad,,
'Wassermanns Braut:'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d041_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Haupt und Schmaler,

I, 62, No 34. A
maid begs that she may be left to herself for a year, but her
father says it is time for her to be married. She goes to her
chamber, weeps and wrings her hands. The merman comes and asks,
Where is my bride? They tell him that she is in her chamber,
weeping and wringing her hands. The merman asks her the reason,
and she answers, They all say that you are the merwoman's son. He
says he will build her a bridge of pure silver and gold, and have
her driven over it with thirty carriages and forty horses; but ere
she has half passed the bridge it goes down to the bottom. She is
seven years below, has seven sons in as many years, and is going
with the eighth. She implores her husband to permit her to go to
cburch in the upper world, and he consents, with the proviso that
she shall not stay for the benediction. At church she sees her
brother and sister, who receive her kindly. She tells them that
she cannot stay till the benediction;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d041_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> they beg her to come
home to dine with them. She does wait till the benediction; the
merman rushes frantically about. As she leaves the church and is
saying good-by to her sister, she meets the merman, who snatches
the youngest child from her (she appears to have all seven with
her), tears it in pieces, strangles the rest, scatters their
limbs on the road, and hangs himself, asking, Does not your heart
grieve for your children? She answers, I grieve for none but the
youngest.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d041_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A Slovenian ballad has the story with modifications, Achacel
and Korytko, &#350;lov&eacute;n&#351;ke P&eacute;&#351;mi
krajnskiga Nar&oacute;da, I, 30,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d041_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> 'Povodnji m&oacute;sh;'
given in abstract by Haupt and Schmaler, I, 339, note to No. 34.
Mizika goes to a dance, in spite of her mother's forbidding. Her
mother, in a rage, wishes that the merman may fetch her. A young
man who dances with her whirls her round so furiously that she
complains, but he becomes still more violent. Mizika sees how it
is, and exclaims, The merman has come for me! The merman flies
out of the window with her, and plunges into the water. She bears
a son, and asks leave to pay a visit to her mother; and this is
allowed on conditions, one of which is that she shall not expose
herself to a benediction. She does not conform, and the merman
comes and says that her son is crying for her. She refuses to go
with him, and he tears the boy in two, that each may have a
half.</p>

<p>Two or three of the minuter correspondences between the
Scottish and the Norse or German ballads, which have not been
referred to, may be indicated in conclusion. The hillman, in
several Norwegian copies, as <b>B</b>, <b>M</b>, carries off the
lady on horseback, and so Hastings in <b>C</b>. In <b>A</b>
34-39, the returned sister, being invited to dine, cannot eat a
bit or drink a drop. So, in 'The Maid and the Dwarf-King,'
Swedish <b>G</b> 15, 16, they set before Agnes dishes four and
five, dishes eight and nine, but she can take nothing:</p>

<p>Agneta ej smakte en endaste bit.</p>

<p>Young Akin, in <b>A</b> 43, is found in the wood, "tearing his
yellow hair." The merman has golden hair in Danish <b>A</b> 16,
Swedish <b>D</b> 2, 19, Norwegian <b>A</b> 17 (nothing very
remarkable, certainly), and in Danish <b>D</b> 31 wrings his
hands and is very unhappy, because Agnes refuses to return. It is
much more important that in one of the Swedish copies of the
merman ballad, Grundtvig, II, 661 a, we find a trace of the
'christendom' which is made such an object in the Scottish
ballads:</p>

<p>'Nay,' said the mother, 'now thou art mine,'<br/>
And christened her with water and with wine.</p>

<p>'The Maid and the Dwarf-King,' Danish <b>E</b>, is translated

Quarterly Review, XXV, 35; Swedish <b>C</b> by Keightley, Fairy
