<p>We see from this pretty fragment, which, after the nature of
the best popular ballad, forces you to chant and will not be
read, that a woman had been carried off, four days after bearing
a son, to serve as nurse in the elf-queen's family. She is
promised that she shall be permitted to return home if she will
tend the fairy's bairn till he has got the use of his legs. We
could well have spared stanzas 10-12, which belong to '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_37.html">Thomas Rymer</a>,'
to know a little more of the proper story.</p>

<p>That elves and water-spirits have frequently solicited the
help of mortal women at lying-in time is well known: see

their offspring suckled by earthly women. It is said, writes
Gervase of Tilbury, that nobody is more exposed to being carried
off by water-sprites than a woman in milk, and that they

sometimes restore such a woman, with pay for her services, after
she has nursed their wretched fry seven years. He had himself
seen a woman who had been abducted for this purpose, while
washing clothes on the bank of the Rhone. She had to nurse the
nix's son under the water for that term, and then was sent back
unhurt. Otia Imperialia, III, 85, Liebrecht, p. 38. Choice is
naturally made of the healthiest and handsomest mothers for this
office. "A fine young woman of Nithsdale, when first made a
mother, was sitting singing and rocking her child, when a pretty
lady came into her cottage, covered with a fairy mantle. She
carried a beautiful child in her arms, swaddled in green silk.
'Gie my bonnie thing a suck,' said the fairy. The young woman,
conscious to whom the child belonged, took it kindly in her arms,
and laid it to her breast. The lady instantly disappeared,
saying, 'Nurse kin', an ne'er want.' The young mother nurtured
the two babes, and was astonished, whenever she awoke, at finding
the richest suits of apparel for both children, with meat of most
delicions flavor. This food tasted, says tradition, like loaf
mixed with wine and honey," etc. Cromek, Remains of Nithsdale and
Galloway Song, p. 302.</p>
