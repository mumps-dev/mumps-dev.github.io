<p>Also Douce, III, 120 b, London, by L. How, and Roxburghe, III,
408: both of these are of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p><b>a</b> is printed, with not a few changes, in Ritson's Robin
Hood, 1795, II, 66. Evans, Old Ballads, 1777, 1784, I, 143,
agrees nearly with the Aldermary garland.</p>

<p>Robin Hood, walking the forest, meets a gaily-dressed young
fellow, who presently brings down a deer at forty yards with his
bow. Robin commends the shot, and offers the youngster a place as
one of his yeomen. The offer is rudely received; each bends his
bow at the other. Robin suggests that one of them may be slain,
if they shoot: swords and bucklers would be better. Robin strikes
the first blow, and is so stoutly answered that he is fain to
know who the young man is. His name is Gamwell, and, having
killed his father's steward, he has fled to the forest to join
his uncle, Robin Hood. The kinsmen embrace, and walk on till they
meet Little John. Robin Hood tells John that the stranger has
beaten him. Little John would like a bout, to see if the stranger
can beat him. This Robin forbids, for this stranger is his own
sister's son; he shall be next in rank to Little John among his
yeomen, and be called Scarlet.</p>

<p>The story seems to have been built up on a portion of the
ruins, so to speak, of the fine tale of Gamelyn. There the king
of the outlaws, sitting at meat with his seven score young men,
sees Gamelyn wandering in the wood with Adam, and tells some of
his young men to fetch them in. Seven start up to execute the
order, and when they come to Gamelyn and his comrade bid the
twain hand over their bows and arrows. Gamelyn replies, Not
though ye fetch five men, and so be twelve; but no violence being
attempted, the pair go to the king, who asks them what they seek
in the woods. Gamelyn answers, No harm; but to shoot a deer, if
we meet one, like hungry men. The king gives them to eat and
drink of the best, and, upon learning that the spokesman is
Gamelyn, makes him master, under himself, over all the outlaws.
Little John having long had the place of first man under Robin,
the best that the ballad-maker could do for Gamwell was to make
him chief yeoman after John.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d128_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> (The Tale of Gamelyn, ed.
Skeat, vv 625-686. The resemblance of the ballad is remarked upon
at p. x.)</p>

<p>Ritson gives this ballad the title of Robin Hood and the
Stranger, remarking: The title now given to this ballad is that
which it seems to have originally borne; having been foolishly
altered to Robin Hood newly Revived. R.H. and the Bishop, R.H.
and the Beggar, R.H. and the Tanner, are directed to be sung to
the tune of Robin Hood and the Stranger, but no ballad bears such
a title in any garland or broadside.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d128_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The ballad referred to
as Robin Hood and the Stranger may possibly have been this, but,
for reasons given at p. 133, Robin Hood and Little John is, as I
think, more likely to be the one meant.</p>

<p>Robin Hood and the Stranger was one name for the most popular
of Robin Hood tunes, and this particular tune was sometimes
called 'Robin Hood' absolutely (see the note at the end of the
next ballad). If the ballad denoted by Robin Hood and the
Stranger was also sometimes known as 'Robin Hood' simply, and
especially if this ballad was Robin Hood and Little John, an
explanation presents itself of the title 'Robin Hood newly
Revived.' What is revived is the favorite topic of the process by
which Robin Hood enlarged and strengthened his company. The
earlier ballad had shown how Little John came to join the band;
the second undertakes to tell us how Scarlet was enlisted, the
next most important man after John.</p>

<p>The second part, referred to in the last stanza, was
separated, Mr. Chappell thought, when the present ballad was
"newly revived," because the whole was found too long for a penny
(one would say that both parts together were "dear enough a
leek"), and seven stanzas (incoherent in themselves and not
cohering with what lies before us) added to fill up the sheet.
These stanzas will be given under No 130, as Robin Hood and the
Scotchman; and the "second part," 'R.H. and the Prince of
Aragon,' or ' R.H., Will. Scadlock and Little John,' follows
immediately.</p>
