<p>First printed by Jamieson (<b>C</b> <b>b</b>) in 1806, who
says: "For the copy of the ballad here given I am indebted to
Mrs. Brown. I have also collated it with another, less perfect,
but not materially different, so far as it goes, with which I was
favored by the editor of the Border Minstrelsy, who took it down
from the recitation of two ladies, great-grandchildren of
Farquharson of Inverey; so that the ballad, and the notices that
accompany it, are given upon the authority of a Gordon [Anne
Gordon, Mrs. Brown] and a Farquharson."{[2}} <b>A</b> <b>c</b> is
also a compounded copy: see the notes.</p>

<p>The text in The Thistle of Scotland, p. 46, is <b>C</b>
<b>b</b>. That which is cited in part in the Fourth Report on
Historical Manuscripts, 1874, p. 584, is <b>A</b> <b>c</b>. The
ballad is rewritten by Allan Cunningham, Songs of Scotland, II,
208.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. Inverey comes before day to Brackley's gate, and
calls to him to open and have his blood spilled. Brackley asks
over the wall whether the people below are gentlemen or hired
gallows-birds; if gentlemen, they may come in and eat and drink;
in the other case, they may go on to the Lowlands and steal
cattle. His wife urges him to get up; the men are nothing but
hired gallows-birds. Brackley will go out to meet Inverey (both
know it is he, 12, 19), but these same gallows-birds will prove
themselves men. His wife derisively calls on her maids to bring
their distaffs; if Brackley is not man enough to protect his
cattle, she will drive off the robbers with her women. Brackley
says he will go out, but he shall never come in. He arms and
sallies forth, attended by his brother William, his uncle, and
his cousin; but presently bids his brother turn back because he
is a bridegroom. William refuses, and in turn, but equally to no
effect, urges Brackley to turn back for his wife's and his son's
sake. The Gordons are but four against four hundred of Inverey's,
and are all killed. Brackley's wife, so far from tearing her
hair, braids it, welcomes Inverey, and makes him a feast. The
son, on the nurse's knee, vows to be revenged if he lives to be a
man. (Cf. '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_169.html">Johnie Armstrong</a>,' III, 367, where this should have
been noted.)</p>

<p>The other versions agree with <b>A</b> <b>a</b> in the
material points. Inverey's numbers are diminished. In <b>B</b>
10, <b>C</b> 11, Brackley has only his brother with him, meaning,
perhaps, when he leaves his house. The fight was not simply at
the gates, but was extended over a considerable distance
(<b>A</b> 33, <b>B</b> 11), and other men joined the Gordons in
the course of it. In <b>B</b> 12 we learn that the miller's four
sons (<b>D</b> 10, the miller and his three sons) were killed
with the Gordons (and William Gordon's wife, or bride, in
<b>A</b> 25, is 'bonnie Jean, the maid o the mill'). In <b>B</b>
15, <b>D</b> 12, Craigevar comes up with a party, and might have
saved Brackley's life had he been there an hour sooner. In
<b>A</b> <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, Brackley's wife
is Peggy (Peggy Dann, wrongly, <b>D</b> 14, 15); in <b>B</b> 19
(wrongly) Catharine Fraser. <b>D</b> makes Catharine the wife of
Gordon of Glenmuick (Alexander Gordon, <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 35), who
rives her hair, as Brackley's wife does not (14, 15, 18, 19). In
<b>C</b>, Peggy Gordon, besides feasting Inverey, keeps him till
morning, and then shows him a road by which he may go safely
home. <b>C</b> <b>b</b> adds, for poetical justice, that Inverey
at once let this haggard down the wind.</p>

<p>This affray occurred in September, 1666. The account of it
given by the Gordons (the son of the murdered laird and the
Marquis of Huntly) was that John Gordon of Brackley, having
poinded cattle belonging to John Farquharson of Inverey, or his
followers, Inverey "convoked his people, to revenge himself on
Brackley for putting the law in execution; that he came to the
house of Brackley, and required the laird to restore his cattle
which had been poinded; and that, although the laird gave a fair
answer, yet the Farquharsons, with the view of drawing him out of
his house, drove away not only the poinded cattle but also
Brackley's own cattle, and when the latter was thus forced to
come out of his house, the Farquharsons fell on him and murdered
him and his brother."</p>

<p>A memorandum for John Farquharson of Inverey and others, 24
January, 1677, "sets forth that John Gordon of Brackley, having
bought from the sheriff of Aberdeen the fines exigible from
Inverey and others for killing of black-fish, the said Brackley
made friendly arrangements with others, but declined to settle
with Inverey; whereupon the latter, being on his way to the
market at Tullich,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d203_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> sent Mr. John Ferguson, minister at
Glenmuick, John McHardy of Crathie, a notary, and Duncan Erskine,
portioner of Invergelder, to the laird of Brackley, with the view
of representing to him that Inverey and his tenants were willing
to settle their fines on the same terms as their neighbors. These
proposals were received by Brackley with contempt, and during the
time of the communing he gathered his friends and attacked
Inverey, and having * loused severall shotts' against Inverey's
party, the return shots of the latter were in self-defence. The
result was that the laird of Brackley, with his brother William
and their cousin James Gordon in Cults, were killed on the one
side, and on the other Robert McWilliam in Inverey, John
McKenzie, sometime there, and Malcom Gordon the elder." The
convocation of Inverey's friends is accounted for in the same
document by the fact that Inverey was captain of the watch for
the time; that he and his ancestors had been used to go to the
market with men to guard it; and that it is the custom of the
country for people who are going to the market to join any
numerous company that may be going the same way, either for their
own security or out of "kindness for the persons with whom they
go," and also the custom of that mountainous country to go with
arms, especially at markets. (Abstract, by Dr. John Stuart, of a
Manuscript of Col. James Farquharson of Invercauld, Historical
Manuscripts Commission, Fourth Report, p. 534).</p>

<p>Another account, agreeing in all important points with the
last, is given in a history of the family of Macintosh.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d203_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> It
will be borne in mind that Inverey belonged to this clan, and
that acts of his would therefore be put in a favorable light.
Brackley had seized the horses of some of Inverey's people on
account of fines alleged to be due by them for taking salmon in
the Dee out of season. Inverey represented to Brackley that the
sufferers by this proceeding were men who had incurred no
penalty, and offered, if the horses should be restored, to
deliver the guilty parties for punishment. Brackley would not
return the horses on these terms, and Inverey then proposed that
the matter in dispute should be left to friends. While Brackley
was considering what to do, Alexander Gordon of Aberfeldy came to
offer his services, with a body of armed men, and Brackley, now
feeling himself strong, rejected the suggestion of a peaceful
solution, and set out to attack Inverey. When a collision was
impending, Inverey at first drew back, begging Brackley to desist
from violence, which only made Brackley and Aberfeldy the keener.
Two of Inverey's followers were slain; and then Inverey and his
men, in self-defence, turned on their assailants, and killed
Gordon of Brackley, his brother William, and James Gordon of
Cults.</p>

<p>The Gordons, this account further says, began a prosecution of
Inverey and his party before the Court of Justiciary. Inverey had
recourse to Macintosh, his chief, who exerted himself so
effectually in behalf of his kinsman that when the case was
called no plaintiff appeared. Nevertheless Dr. John Stuart
(Historical Manuscripts, as above) produces a warrant "for
apprehending John Farquharson of Inverey and others his
followers, who had been outlawed for not compearing to answer at
their trial, and had subsequently continued for many years in
their outlawry, associating with themselves a company of thieves,
murderers, and sorners; therefore empowering James Innes,
Serjeant, and Corporal Radnoch, commanding a party of troops at
Kincardine O'Neill, to apprehend the said John Farquharson and
his accomplices." From this warrant Dr. Stuart considers that we
may infer that Inverey was the aggressor in the affray with
Brackley. But there is nothing to identify the case, and the date
of the warrant is February 12, 1685, nearly twenty years from the
affair which we are occupied with, during which space, unless he
were of an unusually peaceable habit, Inverey might have had
several broils on his hands.</p>

<p>Gordon of Brackley, as reported by Mrs. Brown, from what she
may have heard in her girlhood, a hundred years after his
tragical end, was "a man universally esteemed."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d203_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> "Farquharson
of Inverey," says Jamieson, without giving his authority, "a
renowned freebooter on Deeside, was his relation, and in habits
of friendly intercourse with him. Farquharson was fierce, daring,
and active, exhibiting all the worst characteristics of a
freebooter, with nothing of that blunt and partially just and
manly generosity which were then not uncommonly met with among
that description of men. The common people supposed him (as they
did Dundee, and others of the same cast who were remarkable for
their fortunate intrepidity and miraculous escapes) to be a
warlock, and proof against steel and lead. He is said to have
been buried on the north side of a hill, which the sun could
never shine upon, etc." All which, as far as appears, is merely
the tradition of Jamieson's day, and will be taken at different
values by different readers.</p>

<p>The 'Peggy' of <b>A</b> <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>
was Margaret Burnet, daughter of Sir Thomas Burnet of Leys, and
own cousin of Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d203_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This lady
married Gordon of Brackley against her friends' wishes, or
without their consent, and so probably made a love-match. After
Brackley's death she married one James Leslie, Doctor of
Medicine,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d203_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> a fact which will suffice to offset the unconfirmed
scandal of the ballad.</p>

<p>It is now to be noted that a baron of Brackley had been
murdered by caterans towards the end of the preceding century.
"The Clanchattan, who, of all that faction, most eagerly
endeavored to revenge the Earl of Murray his death, assembling
their forces under Angus Donald Williamson his conduct, entered
Strathdee and Glenmuick, where they invaded the Earl of Huntly
his lands, and killed four of the surname of Gordon, Henry Gordon
of the Knock, Alexander Gordon of Teldow, Thomas Gordon of
Blaircharrish, and the old baron of Breaghly, whose death and
manner thereof was so much the more lamented because he was very
aged, and much given to hospitality, and slain under trust. He
was killed by them in his own house after he bad made them good
cheer, without suspecting or expecting any such reckoning for his
kindly entertainment; which happened the first day of November,
1592. In revenge whereof the Earl of Huntly assembled some of his
forces and made an expedition into Pettie," etc. (See No 183,
III, 456.) So writes Sir Robert Gordon, before 1630.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d203_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Upon comparing Sir Robert Gordon's description of the old
baron of Brackley who was murdered in 1592 with what is said of
the baron in the ballad (<b>A</b>), there is a likeness for which
there is no historical authority in the instance of the baron of
1666. The ballad intimates the hospitality which is emphasized by
Sir Robert Gordon, and also the baron's unconsciousness of his
having any foe to dread. ("An honest aged man," says Spotiswood,
"against whom they could pretend no quarrel.") Other details are
not pertinent to the elder baron, but belong demonstrably to the
Brackley who had a quarrel with Farquharson.</p>

<p>Of the two, the older Brackley would have a better chance of
being celebrated in a ballad. He was an aged and innocent man,
slain while dispensing habitual hospitality, "slain under trust."
The younger Brackley treated Inverey's people harshly, there was
an encounter, Brackley was killed, and others on both sides. His
friends may have mourned for him, but there was no call for the
feeling expressed in the ballad; that would be more naturally
excited by the death of the kindly old man, 'who basely was
slain.' On the whole it may be surmised that two occurrences, or
even two ballads, have been blended, and some slight items of
corroborative evidence may favor this conclusion.</p>

<p>'The Gordons may mourn him and bann Inverey,' says <b>B</b>
14. It appears that the Earl of Aboyne sided with Inverey, though
the Marquis of Huntly supported the laird of Brackley's son;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d203_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
whereas all the Gordons would have mourned the older baron, and
none would have maintained the caterans who slew him.</p>

<p>In the affray with the Farquharsons in 1666 there were killed,
of the Gordons, besides Brackley, his brother William and his
cousin James Gordon of Cults. The Gordons killed by the
Clanchattan in 1592 were Brackley, Henry Gordon of the Knock, an
Alexander Gordon (also a Thomas). According to <b>A</b> 34, 35,
the Gordons killed were Brackley and his brother William, his
cousin James of the Knox [Knocks, Knock], and his uncle Alexander
Gordon; according to <b>B</b> 12, 13, there were killed, besides
Brackley, "Harry Gordon and Harry of the Knock" (one and the same
person), Brackley's brother, as we see from 10; in <b>D</b> 10,
the killed are Brackley, and Sandy Gordon o the Knock, called
Peter in 21. A Gordon of the Knock is named as killed in
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>, and it is Henry Gordon in <b>B</b>;
an Alexander Gordon is named in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. A William
Gordon and a James (of the Knocks, not of the Cults) are named in
<b>A</b>. On the whole, the names sort much better with the
earlier story.</p>

<p>In <b>B</b> 15 we are told that if Craigievar had come up an
hour sooner, Brackley had not been slain. Upon this Dr. Joseph
Robert son (who assigned the ballad to 1592) has observed,
Kinloch Manuscripts, VI, 24, that Craigievar passed to a branch
of the family of Forbes in 1625; so that Craigievar would have
done nothing to save Brackley in 1666, the Gordons and the
Forbeses having long been at feud. To make sense of this stanza
we must suppose an earlier date than 1625.</p>

<p>The fourth edition of Spotiswood's history, printed in 1677
(about forty years after the author's death), calls Brackley of
1592 John Gordon. Further, there is this anonymous marginal note,
not found in the preceding editions: "I have read in a Manuscript
called the Acts of the Gordons, that Glenmuick, Glentaner,
Strathdee and Birs were spoiled, and Brachlie, with his
son-in-law, slain, by Mackondoquy [that is Maconochie,
<i>alias</i> Campbell] of Inner-Aw."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d203_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Brackley, on the Muick, is in close vicinity to the village of
Ballater, on the Dee, some forty miles westward from Aberdeen.</p>
