<h3>Bothwell Bridge</h3>

<ol type="A">
<li>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, III, 209, 1803;
II, 226, 1833. From recitation. <a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=Child_d20601.html"><i>Version A</i></a></li>
</ol>

<p>The report of the success of the Covenanters at Drumclog
brought four or five thousand malcontents into the rising, many
of whom, however, were not radicals of the Hamilton type, but
moderate Presbyterians. After not a little moving up and down,
they established their camp on the nineteenth of June at
Hamilton, on the south side of the Clyde, near the point where
the river is crossed by Bothwell Bridge. They were deficient in
arms and ammunition and in officers of military experience.
"But," as a historian of their own party says, "the greatest loss
was their want of order and harmony among themselves; neither had
they any person in whom they heartily centred, nor could they
agree upon the grounds of their appearance." Both before and
after their final encampment at Hamilton, they were principally
occupied with debating what testimony they should make against
Popery, Prelacy, Erastianism, and the Indulgence, and whether
their declaration should contain an acknowledgment of the king's
authority. Dissension ran high, "and enemies had it to observe
and remark that ministers preached and prayed against one
another."</p>

<p>The king named the Duke of Monmouth to command his army in
Scotland. Both the instructions which were given him and the
duke's own temper were favorable to an accommodation. The royal
forces were at Bothwell Muir on the twenty-second of June, and
their advanced guards within a quarter of a mile of the bridge.
The duke marched his army to an eminence opposite the main body
of the enemy, who lay on the moor (st. 10). The bridge was held
by Hackston of Rathillet and other resolute men. It was very
defensible, being only twelve feet wide and rising from each end
to the middle, where there was a gate, and it was also obstructed
with stones. Early in the morning a deputation was sent by the
rebels to the duke to lay before him their demands. He heard them
patiently, and expressed his willingness to do all that he could
for them with the king, but would engage himself to nothing until
they laid down their arms. He gave them an hour to make up their
mind. The officers of the insurgents were unable to come to an
agree ment. Hamilton, who assumed the general command, was
against any pacific arrange ment, and no answer was returned. In
the interim four field-pieces had been planted against the
bridge. The defenders maintained themselves under the fire of
these and of the musketeers and dragoons until their own powder
was exhausted, and then unwillingly withdrew to the main body, by
Hamilton's order. The bridge was cleared of obstructions, and the
royal army crossed and advanced in order of battle against the
rebels on the moor. The first fire made the Covenanters' horse
wheel about, and their retreat threw the nearest foot into
disorder; in consequence of which the whole army fell into
confusion. Twelve hundred surrendered with out resistance, the
rest fled, and several hun dred were killed in the
pursuit.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d206_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>1-9. William Gordon of Earlston, a hot Covenanter, while on
his way to Hamilton on the twenty-second to join the insurgents,
fell in with some dragoons who were pursuing his already routed
copartisans, and, resisting their attempt to make him prisoner,
was killed. His son Alexander, a man of more temperate views, was
at Bothwell Bridge,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d206_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and escaped. Although Earlston in st. 4
is represented as bidding farewell to his father, the grotesque
narrative with which the ballad begins can be understood only of
the father; sts. 7, 8 make this certain.</p>

<p>9. It seems to be meant, as grammar would require, that it is
the 'Lennox lad,' and a Covenanter, that sets up 'the flag of red
set about with blue.' In "Old Mortality," Sir Walter Scott makes
the Covenanters plant "the scarlet and blue colors of the
Scottish covenant" on the keep of Tillietudlem. Whether he had
other authority than this ballad for the scarlet, I have not been
able to ascertain. All the flags of the covenant may not have
been alike, but all would probably have a ground of blue, which
is known to have been the Covenanters' color. One flag, which
belonged to a Covenanter who figured at Drumclog and Bothwell
Bridge, has fortunately been preserved. It is of blue silk, with
three inscriptions, one of which is, "No Quarters to
y<sup>e</sup> Active Enimies of y<sup>e</sup> Covenant," first
painted in some light color, afterwards repainted in a dull red.
(Napier, I, xliv).</p>

<p>The last half of the stanza must be spoken by Monmouth, and
the tone of it is more chivalrous than the circumstances call
for.</p>

<p>12-15. For Claverhouse's cornet, see the preceding ballad.
Captain John Graham, for that was all he then was, was not
conspicuous at Bothwell Bridge. He commanded the horse on the
right, and Captain Stuart the dragoons on the left, when the
advance was made on the Covenanters. He was as capable of
insubordination as Robert Hamilton was of Erastianism, and it is
nearly as unnecessary, at this day, to vindicate him from the
charge of cruelty as from that of procuring Mon mouth's execution
six years in advance of the fates.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d206_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>'Earlistoun,' Chambers, Twelve Romantic Scottish Ballads, p.
26, is this piece with the battle omitted, or stanzas 1-6,
7<sup>1,2</sup>, 8<sup>3,4</sup>, 16.</p>

<p>Scott observes: "There is said to be another song upon this
battle, once very popular, but I have not been able to recover
it."</p>

<p>There is a stall-ballad of Bothwell Brigg, not traditional, a
very good ballad of its sort, with a touching story and a kindly
moral, which may or may not be later than Sir Walter Scott's day.
It is of John Carr and his wife Janet and a non-covenanting lady,
who carries off John, badly wounded, from the field (where he had
fought better than most of his party), and nurses him in her
lord's castle till he is well enough to be visited by his
wife.</p>
