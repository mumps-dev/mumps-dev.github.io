<h3>215. Rare Willie Drowned in Yarrow - Appendix</h3>

<h3>Annan Water</h3>

<p>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, 1833, III, 282; 1802, 
II, 138.</p>

<p>The first edition lacks stanzas 5, 6, 8, 9. Two of these were
inserted "from another copy of the ballad in which the conclusion
proves fortunate."</p>

<p>"The ballad," says Scott, "is given from tradition," for which
a more precise expression would perhaps be "oral repetition." It
is asserted in the Minstrelsy to be "the original words of the
tune of 'Allan Water,' by which name the song is mentioned in
Ramsay's Tea-Table Miscellany" ('Allan Water, or, My love Annie's
very bonny,' T.T.M., vol. i, p. 105, of the Dublin edition of
1729). This assertion is not justified by any reasons, nor does
it seem pertinent, if the Allan was originally the river of the
ballad, to add, as the editor does, that "the Annan and the Frith
of Solway, into which it falls, are the frequent scenes of
tragical accidents."</p>

<p>A song which may pass for the original Allan Water until an
earlier is produced is among the Laing broadsides (now in the
possession of Lord Rosebery), No 59. There is no date or place,
but it is thought to have been printed toward the end of the
seventeenth century, or the beginning of the eighteenth, and
probably at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The title is: 'Allan Water, or, A Lover in Captivity.'<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d215app_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> A
new song, sung with a pleasant new air.' There are three
eight-line stanzas, and it be gins:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right">&nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>Allan Water 's wide and deep,<br/>
and my dear Anny 's very bonny;<br/>
Wide 's the straith that lyes above 't,<br/>
if 't were mine, I 'de give it all for Anny.</td></tr>

</table>


<p>Allan Cunningham says of the ballad, Songs of 
Scotland, II, 102: "I have heard it sung on the 
banks of the Annan. Like all traditional verses, 
there are many variations." And he cites as "from 
an old fragment " these couplets:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right">&nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>Annan water's wading deep, [i.e. wide and]<br/>
Yet I am loth to weet my feet;<br/>
But if ye'll consent to marry me,<br/>
I'll hire a horse to carry thee.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d215app_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></td></tr>

</table>

<p>It is my conviction that 'Anna Water,' in Ramsay's language,
is one of the "Scots poems wrote by the ingenious before"
1800.</p>

<p>"By the Gatehope Slack," says Sir Walter Scott, "is perhaps
meant the Gate Slack, a pass in Annandale."</p>
