<h3>37. Thomas Rymer</h3>

<p>Thomas of Erceldoune, otherwise Thomas the Rhymer, has had a
fame as a seer, which, though progressively narrowed, is, after
the lapse of nearly or quite six centuries, far from being
extinguished. The common people throughout the whole of Scotland,
according to Mr. Robert Chambers (1870), continue to regard him
with veneration, and to preserve a great number of his prophetic
sayings, which they habitually seek to connect with "dear years"
and other notable public events. A prediction of Thomas of
Erceldoune's is recorded in a manuscript which is put at a date
before 1320, and he is referred to with other soothsayers in the
Scalacronica, a French chronicle of English history begun in
1355. Erceldoune is spoken of as a poet in Robert Mannyng's
translation of Langtoft's Chronicle, finished hi 1338, and in the
Auchinleck copy of 'Sir Tristrem,' thought to have been made
about 1350, a Thomas is said to have been consulted at Erpeldoun
touching the history of Tristrem. So that we seem safe in holding
that Thomas of Erceldoune had a reputation both as prophet and
poet in the earlier part of the fourteenth century. The
vaticinations of Thomas are cited by various late chroniclers,
and had as much credit in England as in Scotland. All this might
have been if Thomas of Erceldoune had not been more historical
than Merlin. But the name is known to have belonged to a real
person. Just when he lived is not certain, but it was somewhere
between 1210 and 1296 or 1297.</p>

<p>Thomas of Erceldoune's prophetic power was a gift of the queen
of the elves; the modern elves, equally those of northern Europe
and of Greece, resembling in respect to this attribute the nymphs
of the ancient Hellenic mythology. How Thomas attained this grace
is set forth in the first three fits of a poem which bears his
name. This poem has come down in four somewhat defective copies:
the earliest written a little before the middle of the fifteenth
century, two others about 1450, the fourth later. There is a
still later manuscript copy of the second and third fits. All the
manuscripts are English, but it is manifest from the nature of
the topics that the original poem was the work of a Scotsman. All
four of the complete versions speak of an older story. This was
undoubtedly a romance which narrated the adventure of Thomas with
the elf-queen simply, without specification of his prophecies. In
all probability it concluded with Thomas's return to fairy-land
after a certain time passed in this world. The story of Thomas
and the Elf-queen is but another version of what is related of
Ogier le Danois and Morgan the Fay. The fairy adventures of
Thomas and of Ogier have the essential points in common, and even
the particular trait that the fairy is taken to be the Virgin.
The occurrence of this trait again in the ballad, viewed in
connection with the general similarity of the two, will leave no
doubt that the ballad had its source in the romance. Yet it is an
entirely popular ballad as to style, and must be of considerable
age, though the earliest version (A) can be traced at furthest
only into the first half of the eighteenth century.</p>
