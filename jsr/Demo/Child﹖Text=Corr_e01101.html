<p><b>Moravian</b>, Su&#353;il, 'Ne&#353;t'astna svatba,' 'The Unhappy
Wedding,' No 89, c, d, pp 85 f. A bridegroom is bringing home his
bride; his sword slips from the sheath and wounds the bride in
the side. He binds up the wound, and begs her to hold out till
she comes to the house. The bride can eat nothing, and dies in the
night. Her mother comes in the morning with loads of cloth and
feathers, is put off when she asks for her daughter, reproaches
the bridegroom for having killed her; he pleads his innocence.</p>

<p><b>Servian</b>. Karadshitch, I, 309, No 421, 'Jani and
Milenko,' belongs to this class, though mixed with portions of at
least one other ballad ('Earl Brand'). Milenko wooes the fair
Jani, and is favored by her mother and by all her brothers but
the youngest. This brother goes hunting, and bids Jani open to
nobody while he is away, but Milenko carries her off on his
horse. As they are riding over a green hill, a branch of a tree
catches in Jani's dress. Milenko attempts to cut the branch off
with his knife, but in so doing wounds Jani in the head. Jani
binds up the wound, and they go on, and presently meet the
youngest brother, who hails Milenko, asks where he got the fair
maid, discovers the maid to be his sister, but bids her godspeed.
On reachine his mother's house, Milenko asks that a bed may be
prepared for Jani, who is in need of repose. Jani dies in the
night, Milenko in the morning. They are buried in one grave; a
rose is planted over her, a grape-vine over him, and these
intertwine, "as it were Jani with Milenko."</p>

<p>143 b, after the first paragraph. A pallikar, who is bringing
home his bride, is detained on the way in consequence of his
whole train leaving him to go after a stag. The young man, who
has never seen his bride's face, reaches over his horse to give
her a kiss; his knife disengages itself and wounds her. She begs
him to staunch the blood with his handkerchief, praying only to
live to see her bridegroom's house. This wish is alllowed her;
she withdraws the handkerchief from the wound and expires. Dozon,

four cows and four calves, to his wife a house. "And to me?" the
mother asks. "To you that big stone and the deep Danube, because
you have poisoned me and parted me from my beloved." Su&#353;il,
