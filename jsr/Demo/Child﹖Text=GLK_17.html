<h3>17. Hind Horn</h3>

<p>The story of 'Horn,' of which this ballad gives little more
than the catastrophe, is related at full in (i) 'King Horn,' a
gest in about 1550 short verses, preserved in three manuscripts:
the oldest regarded as of the second half of the 13th century, or
older; the others put at 1300 and a little later, (ii) 'Horn et
Rymenhild,' a romance in about 5250 heroic verses, preserved
likewise in three manuscripts; the best in the Public Library of
the University of Cambridge, and of the 14th century. (iii) 'Horn
Childe and Maiden Rimnild,' from a manuscript of the 14th
century, in not quite 100 twelve-line stanzas. The relations of
these versions to each other and to the ballad are not entirely
clear. For the whole matter, see Schofield, Publications of the
Modern Language Association of America, xviii, 1 ff, where full
references will be found.</p>

<p>Certain points in the story of Horn &mdash; the long absence,
the sudden return, the appearance under disguise at the wedding
feast, and the dropping of the ring into a cup of wine obtained
from the bride &mdash; repeat themselves in a great number of
romantic tales. More commonly it is a husband who leaves his wife
for seven years, is miraculously informed on the last day that
she is to be remarried on the morrow, and is restored to his home
in the nick of time, also by superhuman means. Examples of such
stories are the sixteenth-century chapbook of Henry the Lion; the
Middle High German Reinfrid von Braunschweig; Der edle Moringer;
Torello, in Boccaccio's Decameron, x, 9.</p>
