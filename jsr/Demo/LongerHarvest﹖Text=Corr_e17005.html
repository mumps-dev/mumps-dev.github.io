<p>P. 372-6. Appendix. 'The Duke of Bedford,' Longman's Magazine,
XVII, 217, 1890, "sent from Suffolk," is one half (sts 5-8) a
plagiarism from 'The Death of Queen Jane.' Compare <b>A</b>, 5,
6, <b>B</b>, 8, C<b>,</b> 5, 6, <b>D</b> 6 of Queen Jane with
what follows. The remainder of 'The Duke of Bedford' is so
trivial that it is not worth the while at present to assign that
piece its own place. I have not attempted to identify this duke
of Bedford; any other duke would probably answer as well.</p>
