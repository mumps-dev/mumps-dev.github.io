<h3>273. King Edward the Fourth and a Tanner of Tamworth</h3>

<p>In the Stationers' Registers, Oct. 6, 1600, there was entered
to William White, by the consent of Widow Danter, 'A merye,
pleasant and delectable history betwene Kinge Edward the IIIJ th
and a Tanner of Tamworthe,' and, by like consent of the Widow
Danter, "the bal[l]ad of the same matter that was printed by her
husband John Danter." Arber, in, 173. The ballad mentioned in
this entry is unquestionably our ballad, or an earlier form of
it. No copy from the first half of the seventeenth century is
known to be preserved. The "delectable history" entered under the
same date is extant in an edition of 1596. printed by John
Danter. and in one of 1613, printed by William White (both edited
in Child, v, 81 ff.). The ballad, as we have it, was made by
abridging the fifty-six stanzas of the history to thirty-nine,
with other changes. The history itself has its undoubted original
in 'The King and the Barker' (printed in Child, v, 78 ft .),
between which and the history, though the former lias come down
to us in a sadly mutilated condition, and has been freely treated
in the remodelling, there still remain a few verbal
correspondences. Several good points are added in the history,
and one or two dropped.</p>

<p>Other similar rhymed tales in English are John the Reeve
(Percy Manuscript), Rauf Coilyear, King Edward III and the
Shepherd (Hartshorne's Ancient Metrical Tales), King Henry II and
the Miller of Mansfield (Child, v, 84 ff.), etc.</p>
