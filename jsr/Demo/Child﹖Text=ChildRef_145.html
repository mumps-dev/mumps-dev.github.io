<p>A copy in Roxburghe, III, 450, printed by L. How, in Petticoat
Lane, is of the eighteenth century. In Ritson's Robin Hood, 1795,
II, 82, "from an old black-letter copy in a private collection,
compared with another in that of Anthony a Wood." In Evans's Old
Ballads, 1777, 1784, I, 149, from an Aldermary garland.</p>

<p>Robin Hood has made Queen Katherine his friend by presenting
her with a sum of gold which he had taken from the king's
harbingers. The king has offered a heavy wager that his archers
cannot be excelled, and the queen may have her choice of all
other bowmen in England. Availing herself of these terms, the
queen summons Robin Hood and his men, who are to come to London
on St. George's day, under changed names. She hopes to have Robin
relieved of his outlawry. The king's archers lead off, and make
three. The ladies think the queen has no chance. She asks Sir
Richard Lee, known to us already from the Gest, to be on her
side. Sir Richard Lee, we are told, is sprung from Gawain's blood
(<b>A</b>, Gower's, Gowrie's in other texts), and naturally would
deny nothing to a lady. The Bishop of Hereford declines to be of
the queen's party, but stakes a large sum on the king's men. The
queen's archers shoot, and the game stands three and three; the
queen bids the king beware. The third three shall pay for all,
says the king. It is now time for the outlaws to do their best.
Loxly, as Robin Hood is called, leads off. The particulars of the
outlaws' exploits are wanting in <b>A</b>.</p>

<p>In <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, Robin's feat is obscurely described.
Clifton, who represents Scarlet (for in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>,
contrary to older tradition, Scarlet seems to be put before
John), cleaves the willow wand, and Midge (Mutch), the Miller's
Son, who, according to <b>A</b> 10, is John, is but little behind
him.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d145_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The queen, to assure the safety of her men, begs the
boon that the king will not be angry with any of her party, and
the king replies, Welcome, friend or foe.</p>

<p>After this there is no occasion for concealment. The Bishop of
Hereford, learning who Loxly is, says that Robin is only too old
an acquaintance; Robin had once made him say a mass at two in the
afternoon, and borrowed money of him which had never been repaid.
Robin offers to pay him for the mass by giving half of the gold
back. Small thanks, says the bishop, for paying me with my own
money. King Henry, quite outstripping even the easiness of Edward
in the Gest, says he loves Robin never the worse, and invites him
to leave his outlaws and come live at the court, a proposal which
is peremptorily rejected. This is a very pleasant ballad, with
all the exaggeration, and it is much to be regretted that one
half of <b>A</b> is lost.</p>

<p><b>C</b> is a piece of regular hack-work, and could not
maintain itself in competition with <b>B</b>, upon which,
perhaps, it was formed. It will be observed that Sir Richard Lee
is changed into Sir Robert Lee in <b>C</b>, and that the
thirty-fourth stanza represents the king as subsequently making
Robin Hood Earl of Huntington.</p>

<p>The adventure of the Bishop of Hereford with Robin Hood is the
subject of a separate ballad, now found only in a late form: see
No 144.</p>

<p>Loxly, the name given to Robin in the present ballad, is,
according to the Life in the Sloane Manuscript, a town in
Yorkshire, "or after others in Nottinghamshire," where Robin was
born. The ballad of Robin Hood's Birth, Breeding, etc., following
the same tradition, or invention, says "Locksly town in
Nottinghamshire." It appears from Spencer Hall's Forester's
Offering, London, 1841, that there is a Loxley Chase near
Sheffield, in Yorkshire, and a Loxley River too: Gutch, I, 75.</p>

<p>Finsbury field was long a noted place for the practice of
archery. In the year 1498, says Stow, all the gardens which had
continued time out of mind without Moorgate, to wit, about and
beyond the lordship of Fensberry, were destroyed. And of them was
made a plain field for archers to shoot in. Survey of London,
1598, p. 351, cited, with other things pertinent, by Ritson,
Robin Hood, 1795, II, 86 f.</p>

<p>R.H. and the Shepherd, R.H. rescuing Will Stutly, and R.H.'s
Delight, are directed to be sung to the tune of R.H. and Queen
Katherine, B, and may therefore be inferred to be of later date.
R.H.'s Progress to Nottingham is to be sung to "Bold Robin Hood,"
and as this conjunction of words occurs several times in R.H. and
Queen Katherine, and the burden and its disposition, in the
Progress to Nottingham, are the same as in R.H. and Queen
Katherine, "Bold Robin Hood" may indicate this present ballad.
R.H. and Queen Katherine, <b>C</b>, is directed to be sung to the
tune of The Pinder of Wakefield. R.H.'s Chase is a sequel to R.H.
and Queen Katherine.</p>
