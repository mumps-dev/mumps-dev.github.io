<p>First printed by the Foulises, Glasgow, 1755, after a copy
furnished by Sir David Dalrymple, "who gave it as it was
preserved in the memory of a lady." This information we derive
from Percy, who inserted the Dalrymple ballad in his Reliques,
1765, I, 99, "improved, and enlarged with several fine stanzas
recovered from a fragment ... in the Editor's folio Manuscript"
Seven stanzas of the enlarged copy were adopted from this
Manuscript, with changes; 16<sup>2,4</sup>, 30, 35, 36, are
Percy's own; the last three of the Glasgow edition are dropped.
Herd's copy, The Ancient and Modern Scots Songs, 1769, p. 234, is
from Percy's Reliques; so is Pinkerton's, Scottish Tragic
Ballads, 1781, p. 43, with the omission of the seventh stanza and
many alterations. Ritson, Scotish Songs, 1794, II, 17, repeats
the Glasgow copy; so the Campbell Manuscripts, I, 155, and
Finlay, I, 85. The copy in Buchan's Gleanings, p. 180, is
Percy's, with one stanza from Ritson. Of twelve stanzas given in
Burton's History of Scotland, V, 70 f., 3-6 are from Percy's
Reliques (modified by <b>E</b>, a fragment obtained by Burton),
the rest from <b>D</b>.</p>

<p>During the three wretched and bloody years which followed the
assassination of the regent Murray, the Catholic Earl of Huntly,
George Gordon, was one of the most eminent and active of the
partisans of the queen. Mary created him her lieutenant-governor,
and his brother, Adam Gordon, a remarkably gallant and able
soldier, whether so created or not, is sometimes called the
queen's deputy-lieutenant in the north. Our ballad is concerned
with a minor incident of the hostilities in Aberdeenshire between
the Gordons and the Forbeses, a rival but much less powerful
clan, who supported the Reformed faith and the regency or king's
party.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"The queen's lieutenant-deputy in the north, called Sir Adam
Gordon of Auchindown, knight, was very vigilant in his function;
for suppressing of whom the Master of Forbes was directed, with
the regent's commission. But the first encounter, which was upon
the ninth day of October [1571], Auchindown obtained such victory
that he slew of the Forbeses a hundred and twenty persons, and
lost very few of his own." This was the battle of Tulliangus, on
the northern slope of the hills of Coreen, some thirty miles
northwest of Aberdeen. Both parties having been reinforced, an
issue was tried again on the twentieth of November at Crabstane,
in the vicinity of Aberdeen, where Adam Gordon inflicted a severe
defeat on the Forbeses.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>"But what glory and renown," says the contemporary History of
King James the Sixth, "he [Gordon] obtained of these two
victories was all cast down by the infamy of his next attempt;
for immediately after this last conflict he directed his soldiers
to the castle of Towie, desiring the house to be rendered to him
in the queen's name; which was obstinately refused by the lady,
and she burst forth with certain injurious words. And the
soldiers being impatient, by command of their leader, Captain
Ker, fire was put to the house, wherein she and the number of
twenty-seven persons were cruelly burnt to the death."</p>

<p>Another account, reported by a contemporary who lived in
Edinburgh, is that "Adam Gordon sent Captain Ker to the place of
Toway, requiring the lady thereof to render the place of
Carrigill to him in the queen's name, which she would noways do;
whereof the said Adam having knowledge, moved in ire towards her,
caused raise fire thereintill, wherein she, her daughters, and
other persons were destroyed, to the number of twenty-seven or
thereby."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> This was in November, 1571.</p>

<p>We have a third report of this outrage from Richard Bannatyne,
also a contemporary, a man, it may be observed, bitterly hostile
to the queen's party. "Adam of Gordon ... went to the house of
Towie, which he burnt and twenty four persons in the same, never
one escaping but one woman that came through the corns and hather
which was cast to the house-sides, whereby they were smothered.
This was done under assurance; for the laird of Towie's wife,
being sister to the lady Crawfurd (and also died within the
house), sent a boy to the laird in time of the truce (which was
for the space of twelve hours) to see on what conditions they
should render the house. In the mean time, Adam Gordon's men laid
the corns and timbers and bather about the house, and set all on
fire."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Buchanan puts the incident which mainly concerns us between
the fights of Tulliangus and Crabstone; so does Archbishop
Spottiswood. "Not long after" the former, says the archbishop,
who was a child of six when the affair occurred, Adam Gordon
"sent to summon the house of Tavoy, pertaining to Alexander
Forbes. The lady refusing to yield without direction from her
husband, he put fire unto it and burnt her therein with children
and servants, being twenty-seven persons in all. This inhuman and
barbarous cruelty made his name odious, and stained all his
former doings; otherwise he was held both active and fortunate in
his enterprises."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Buchanan dispatches the burning of the house in a line: Domus
Alexandri Forbosii, cum uxore pregnante, liberis et ministris,
cremata. Ed. 1582, fol. 248 b.</p>

<p>Towie was a place of no particular importance; judging both by
the square keep that remains, which is described as
insignificant, and by the number of people that the house
contained, it must have been a small place. It is therefore more
probable that Captain Ker burnt Towie while executing a general
commission to harry the Forbeses than that this house should have
been made a special object. But whether this were so or not, it
is evident from the terms in which the transaction is spoken of
by contemporaries, who were familiarized to a ferocious kind of
warfare,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> that there must have been something quite beyond
the common in Captain Ker's proceedings on this occasion, for
they are denounced even in those days as infamous, inhuman, and
barbarously cruel, and the name of Adam Gordon is said to have
been made odious by them.</p>

<p>It is not to be disguised that the language employed by
Spottiswood might be so interpreted as to signify that Ker did
not act in this dreadful business entirely upon his own
responsibility; and the second of the four writers who speak
circumstantially of the affair even intimates that Ker applied to
his superior for instructions. On the other hand, the author of
the History of James the Sixth says distinctly that the house was
fired by the command of Ker, whose soldiers were rendered
impatient by an obstinate refusal to surrender, accompanied with
opprobrious words. The oldest of the ballads, also, which is
nearly coeval with the occurrence, speaks only of Captain Car,
knows nothing of Adam Gordon. On the other hand, Bannatyne knows
nothing, or chooses to say nothing, of Captain Car: Adam Gordon
burns the house, and even does this during a truce. It may be
said that, even if the act were done without the orders or
knowledge of Adam Gordon, he deserves all the ill fame which has
fallen to him, for not punishing, or at least discharging, the
perpetrator of such an outrage. But this would J^e applying the
standards of the nineteenth century (and its very best standards)
to the conduct of the sixteenth. It may be doubted whether there
was at that time a man in Scotland, nay, even a man in Europe,
who would have turned away a valuable servant because he had
cruelly exceeded his instructions.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_008','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>A favorable construction, where the direct evidence is
conflicting, is due to Adam Gordon because of his behavior on two
other occasions, one immediately preceding, and the other soon
following, the burning of the house of Towie. We are told that he
used his victory at Crabstone "very moderately, and suffered no
man to be killed after the fury of the fight was past. Alexander
Forbes of Strath-gar-neck, author of all these troubles betwixt
these two families, was taken at this battle, and as they were
going to behead him Auchindown caused stay his execution. He
entertained the Master of Forbes and the rest of the prisoners
with great kindness and courtesy, he carried the Master of Forbes
along with him to Strathbogie, and in end gave him and all the
rest leave to depart."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_009','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> And again, after another success in a
fight called The Bourd of Brechin, in the ensuing July, he caused
all the prisoners to be brought before him, they expecting
nothing but death, and said to them: "My friends and brethren,
have in remembrance how God has granted to me victory and the
upper hand of you, granting me the same vantage ['vand and
sching'] to punish you wherewith my late father and brother were
punished at the Bank of Fair; and since, of the great slaughter
made on the Queen's Grace's true subjects, and most filthily of
the hanging of my soldiers here by the Earl of Lennox; and since,
by the hanging of ten men in Leith, with other unlawful acts done
contrary to the laws of arms; and I doubt not, if I were under
their dominion, as you are under mine, that I should die the
death most cruelly. Yet notwithstanding, my good brethren and
countrymen, be not afraid nor fear not, for at this present ye
shall incur no danger of your bodies, but shall be treated as
brethren, and I shall do to you after the commandment of God, in
doing good for evil, forgetting the cruelty done to the queen and
her faithful subjects, and receiving you as her faithful subjects
in time coming. Who promised to do the same, and for assurance
hereof each found surety. After which the Regent past hastily out
of Sterling to Dundee, charging all manner of man to follow him,
with twenty days victuals, against the said Adam Gordon. But
there would never a man in those parts obey the charge, by reason
of the bond made before and of the great gentleness of the said
Adam."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_010','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>After the Pacification of February, 1573, Adam Gordon obtained
license to go to France and other parts beyond sea, for certain
years, on condition of doing or procuring nothing to the hurt of
the realm of Scotland; but for private practices of his, contrary
to his promise, in conjunction with Captain Ker and others, he
was ordered to return home, 12th May, 1574. His brother, the Earl
of Huntly, upon information of these unlawful practices in
France, was committed to ward, and when released from ward had to
give security to the amount of 20,000. Adam Gordon returned in
July, 1575, "at the command of the regent," with twenty gentlemen
who had gone to France with him, and was in ward in 1576. He died
at St. Johnston in October, 1580, "of a bleeding." As he was of
tender age in 1562, he must still have been a young man.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_011','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>Thomas Ker was a captain "of men of war"; that is, a
professional soldier. As such he is mentioned in one of the
articles of the Pacification, where it is declared that Captain
Thomas Ker, Captain James Bruce, and Captain Gilbert Wauchop,
with their respective lieutenants and ensigns, and two other
persons, "shall be comprehended in this present pacification, as
also all the soldiers who served under their charges, for deeds
of hostility and crimes committed dm'ing the present troubles."
He was accused of being engaged in practices against the regency,
as we have already seen, in 1574. He was released from ward upon
caution in February, 1575. 1578, 26th July, he was summoned to
appear before the king and council to answer to such things as
should be inquired of him. He is mentioned as a burgher of
Aberdeen 1588, 1591. 1593, 3d March, he is required to give
caution to the amount of 1000 merks that he will not assist the
earls of Huntly and Errol. His "counsail and convoy was chiefly
usit" in an important matter at Balrinnes in 1594, at which
battle he "behavit himself so valiantly" that he was knighted on
the field. November 4, 1594, Captain Thomas Ker and James Ker,
his brother, are ordered to be denounced as rebels, having failed
to appear to answer touching their treasonable assistance to
George, sometime Earl of Huntly; and this seems to be the latest
notice of him that has been recovered.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_012','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>In the Genealogy of the family of Forbes drawn up by Matthew
Lumsden in 1580, and continued to 1667 by William Forbes, p. 43
f., ed. 1819, we read: "John Forbes of Towie married &mdash;
Grant, daughter to John Grant of Bandallach, who did bear to him
a son who was unmercifullie murdered in the castle of Corgaffe;
and after the decease of Bandallach's daughter, the said John
Forbes married Margaret Campbell, daughter to Sir John Campbell
of Calder, knight, who did bear him three sons, Alex. Forbes of
Towie, John Forbes, thereafter of Towie, and William Forbes...
The said John Forbes of Towie, after the murder of Margaret
Campbell, married Forbes, a daughter to the Reires,"by whom he
had a son, who, as also a son of his own, died in Germany.
Alexander and William, sons of Margaret Campbell, died without
succession, and by the death of an only son of John, junior, the
house of Towie became extinct." The rest of the said Margaret
Campbell's bairns, with herself, were unmercifullie murdered in
the castle of Corgaffe."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_013','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a></p>

<p>According to the Lumsden genealogy, then, Margaret Campbell,
with her younger children, and also a son of her husband, John
Forbes of Towie, by a former marriage, were murdered at the
castle of Corgaffe. Corgarf is a place "exigui nominis," some
fifteen miles west of Towie, and, so far as is known, there is
nothing to connect this place with the Forbes family.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_014','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> Three
sixteenth-century accounts, and a fourth by an historian who was
born before the event, make Towie to be the scene of the
"murder," and Towie we know to have been in the possession of a
member of the house of Forbes for several generations. Since
Lumsden wrote only nine years after the event, and was more
particularly concerned with the Forbes family than any of the
other writers referred to, his statement cannot be peremptorily
set aside. But we may owe Corgarf to the reviser of 1667,
although he professes not to have altered the substance of his
predecessor's work.</p>

<p>Reverting now to the ballad, we observe that none of the seven
versions, of which one is put towards the end of the sixteenth
century, one is of the seventeenth century, two are of the
eighteenth, and the remainder from tradition of the present
century, lay the scene at Towie. <b>B</b>, which is of this
century, has Cargarf. <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, the oldest copies (both
English), give no name to the castle. Crecrynbroghe in <b>A</b>,
Bittonsborrow in <b>B</b>, are not the name of the castle that is
burned, but of a castle suggested for a winter retirement by one
of Car's men, and rejected by the captain. The fragment <b>C</b>
(English again) also names no place. <b>D</b> transfers the scene
from the north to the house of Rodes, near Dunse, in
Berwickshire, and <b>F</b>, <b>G</b> to Loudoun castle in
Ayrshire; the name of Gordon probably helping to the localizing
of the ballad in the former case, and that of Campbell, possibly,
in the other.</p>

<p>Captain Car is the leader of the bloody band in <b>A</b>,
<b>B</b>; he is lord of Eastertown <b>A</b> 6, 13, of Westertown
<b>B</b> 5, 9; but 'Adam' is said to fire the house in <b>B</b>
14. Adam Gordon is the captain in <b>C</b>-<b>G</b>. The
sufferers are in <b>A</b> Hamiltons,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_015','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> in <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>,
Campbells. The name Forbes is not preserved in any version.</p>

<p><b>A</b>, <b>B</b>. Martinmas weather forces Captain Car to
look for a hold. Crecrynbroghe, <b>A</b>, Bittonsborrow,
<b>B</b>, is proposed, but he knows of a castle where there is a
fair lady whose lord is away, and makes for that. The lady sees
from the wall a host of men riding towards the castle, and thinks
her lord is coming home, but it was the traitor Captain Car. By
supper-time he and his men have lighted about the place. Car
calls to the lady to give up the house; she shall lie in his arms
that night, and the morrow heir his land. She will not give up
the house, but fires on Car and his men. [Orders are given to
burn the house.] The lady entreats Car to save her eldest son.
Lap him in a sheet and let him down, says Car; and when this is
done, cuts out tongue and heart, ties them in a handkerchief, and
throws them over the wall. The youngest son begs his mother to
surrender, for the smoke is smothering him. She would give all
her gold and fee for a wind to blow the smoke away; but the fire
falls about her head, and she and her children are burned to
death. Captain Car rides away, <b>A</b>. The lord of the castle
dreams, learns by a letter, at London, that his house has been
fired, and hurries home. He finds the hall still burning, and
breaks out into expressions of grief, <b>A</b>. In <b>B</b>, half
of which has been torn from the manuscript, after reading the
letter he says he will find Car wherever Car may be, and, long
ere day, comes to Dractonsborrow, where the miscreant is. If nine
or ten stanzas were not lost at this point, we should no doubt
learn of the revenge that was taken.</p>

<p>In the short fragment <b>C</b>, upon surrender being demanded,
reply is made by a shot which kills seven of the beleaguerers. An
only daughter, smothered by the reek, asks her mother to give up
the house. Rather would I see you burnt to ashes, says the
mother. The boy on the nurse's knee makes the same appeal; her
mother would sooner see him burnt than give up her house to be
Adam of Gordon's whore.</p>

<p><b>D</b> makes the lady try fair speeches with Gordon, and the
lady does not reply with firearms to the proposal that she shall
lie by his side. Nevertheless she has spirit enough to say, when
her youngest son beseeches her to give up the house, Come weal,
come woe, you must take share with me. The daughter, and not the
eldest son, is wrapped in sheets and let down the wall; she gets
a fall on the point of Gordon's spear. Then follow deplorable
interpolations, beginning with st. 19. Edom o Gordon, having
turned the girl over with his spear, and wished her alive, turns
her owr and owr again! He orders his men to busk and away, for he
cannot look on the bonnie face. One of his men hopes he will not
be daunted with a dame, and certainly three successive utterances
in the way of sentiment show that the captain needs a little
toning up. At this point the lord of the castle is coming over
the lea, and sees that his castle is in flames. He and his men
put on at their best rate; lady and babes are dead ere the
foremost arrives; they go at the Gordons, and but five of fifty
of these get away.</p>

<p>This is superior to turning her owr and owr again, and indeed,
in its way, not to be improved.</p>

<p>Nothing need be said of the fragment <b>B</b> further than
that the last stanza is modern.</p>

<p>F is purely traditional, and has one fine stanza not found in
any of the foregoing:</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign="top" align="right"> &nbsp;</td>
<td>Out then spake the lady Margaret,<br/>
As she stood on the stair;<br/>
The fire was at her goud garters,<br/>
The lowe was at her hair.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>There is no firing at the assailants (though the lady wishes
that her only son could charge a gun). Lady Margaret, with the
flame in her hair, would give the black and the brown for a drink
of the stream that she sees below. Anne asks to be rowed in a
pair of sheets and let down the wall; her mother says that she
must stay and die with her. Lord Thomas, on the nurse's knee,
says, Give up, or the reek will choke me. The mother would rather
be burned to small ashes than give up the castle, her lord away.
And burnt she is with her children nine.</p>

<p><b>G</b> has the eighteen stanzas of <b>F</b>,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d178_016','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a>
neglecting slight variations, and twenty more (among them the bad
<b>D</b> 21), nearly all superfluous, and one very disagreeable.
Lady Campbell, having refused to "come down" and be "kept"
(caught) on a feather-bed, 5, 6, is ironically asked by Gordon to
come down and be kept on the point of his sword, 7. Since you
will not come down, says Gordon, fire your death shall be. The
lady had liefer be burnt to small ashes than give up the castle
while her lord is from home, 10. Fire is set. The oldest daughter
asks to be rolled in a pair of sheets and flung over the wall.
She gets a deadly fall on the point of Gordon's sword, and is
turned over and over again, 18, over and over again, 19. Lady
Margaret cries that the fire is at her garters and the flame in
her hair. Lady Ann, from childbed where she lies, asks her mother
to give up the castle, and is told that she must stay and dree
her death with the rest. The youngest son asks his mother to go
down, and has the answer that was given Gordon in 10. The
waiting-maid begs to have a baby of hers saved; her lady's long
hair is burnt to her brow, and how can she take it? So the babe
is rolled in a feather-bed and flung over the wall, and gets a
deadly fall on the point of Gordon's ever-ready sword. Several
ill-connected stanzas succeed, three of which are clearly recent,
and then pity for Lady Ann Campbell, who was burnt with her nine
bairns. Lord London comes home a "sorry" man, but comforts
himself with tearing Gordon with wild horses.</p>

<p>A slight episode has been passed over. It is a former servant
of the family that breaks through the house-wall and kindles the
fire, <b>A</b> 21, <b>D</b> 12-14, <b>F</b> 5, 6, <b>G</b> 13,
14. In all but <b>A</b> he makes the excuse that he is now
Gordon's man, and must do or die.</p>

<p>There is a Danish ballad of about 1600 (communicated to me by
Svend Grundtvig, and, I think, not yet printed) in which Karl
grevens s&oslash;n, an unsuccessful suitor of Lady Linild, burns
Lady Linild in her bower, and taking refuge in Maribo church, is
there burned himself by Karl kejserens s&oslash;n, Lady Linild's
preferred lover. See also 'Liden Engel,' under '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_89.html">Fause Foodrage</a>,'
No 89, II, 298. The copy in Percy's Reliques is translated by
Bodmer, I, 126, and by Doenninges, p. 69; Pinkerton's copy by
Grundtvig, No 9, and by Lo&egrave;ve-Veimars, p. 307; Knortz,
Schottische Balladen, No 13, apparently translates
Ailingham's.</p>
