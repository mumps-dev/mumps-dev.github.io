<p>The scene is at the court of Mary Stuart, <b>A</b>-<b>N</b>,
<b>Q</b>. The unhappy heroine is one of the queen's Four Maries,

5, <b>M</b> 1, <b>N</b> 1, also <b>A</b> <b>c</b> 6, Moil, O, but
Lady Maisry, <b>E</b> 6. She gangs wi bairn; it is to the highest
Stewart of a', <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 1, <b>A</b> <b>c</b> 2, <b>B</b>
3, <b>C</b> 5; cf. <b>D</b> 3, <b>G</b> 1-3, <b>I</b> 1-6,
<b>L</b> 9, <b>P</b> 1. She goes to the garden to pull the leaf
off the tree, in a vain hope to be free of the babe, <b>C</b> 3;
it is the savin-tree, <b>D</b> 4, the deceivin-tree, <b>N</b> 3,
the Abbey-tree (and pulled by the king), <b>I</b> 6.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d173_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> She
rolls the bairn in her apron, handkerchief, and throws it in the
sea, <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 3, <b>A</b> <b>b</b> 3, <b>A</b> <b>c</b>
4, <b>C</b> 4, <b>D</b> 5, 9, <b>I</b> 7, <b>K</b> 2, 4, <b>L</b>
5 (inconsistently), <b>O</b> 3; cf. <b>B</b> 7. The queen asks
where the babe is that she has heard greet, <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 4,
<b>b</b> 4, <b>c</b> 6, <b>B</b> 4, 6, <b>C</b> 6, <b>D</b> 6, 8,
<b>B</b> 6, 7, <b>F</b> 6, <b>G</b> 5, <b>H</b> 5, <b>I</b> 9,
<b>J</b> 3, <b>L</b> 1, <b>M</b> 1; there is no babe, it was a
stitch in the side, colic, <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 5, <b>b</b> 5,
<b>c</b> 7, <b>B</b> 5, <b>C</b> 7, <b>D</b> 7, <b>E</b> 8,
<b>F</b> 7, <b>G</b> 6, <b>H</b> 6, <b>I</b> 10, <b>J</b> 4,

bed, dead, <b>B</b> 9, <b>F</b> 9, <b>H</b> 7, <b>J</b> 5,
<b>L</b> 4, <b>M</b> 4 (and <b>A</b> <b>c</b> 8 inconsistently).
The queen bids Mary make ready to go to Edinburgh (i.e., from
Holyrood), <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 6, <b>A</b> <b>b</b> 6, <b>A</b>
<b>c</b> 10, <b>C</b> 8, <b>D</b> 11, <b>E</b> 10, <b>F</b> 12,
<b>H</b> 8, <b>I</b> 11. The purpose is concealed in <b>A</b>,
<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, and for the best effect should be
concealed, or at least simulated, as in <b>B</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>G</b>, <b>I</b>, where a wedding is the pretence, Mary
Hamilton's own wedding in <b>D</b>. The queen directs Mary to put
on black or brown, <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 6, <b>A</b> <b>b</b> 6,
<b>A</b> <b>c</b> 10; she will not put on black or brown, but
white, gold, red, to shine through Edinburgh town, <b>A</b>
<b>a</b> 7, <b>A</b> <b>b</b> 7, <b>A</b> <b>c</b> 11, <b>B</b>
9, <b>C</b> 9, <b>D</b> 13, <b>E</b> 11, <b>H</b> 10, <b>K</b> 6,
<b>N</b> 5, <b>O</b> 5. When she went up the Canongate, <b>A</b>
<b>a</b> 8, <b>b</b> 8, <b>c</b> 13, <b>L</b> 6, up the
Parliament stair, <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 9, <b>b</b> 9, <b>c</b> 14,
<b>D</b> 16, up the Tolbooth stair, <b>C</b> 12, <b>B</b> 14,
<b>H</b> 15, <b>I</b> 17, came to the Netherbow Port, <b>G</b>
10, <b>I</b> 18, <b>M</b> 6, she laughed loudly or lightly,
<b>A</b> <b>a</b> 8, <b>b</b> 8, <b>c</b> 13, <b>D</b> 16,
<b>E</b> 14, <b>G</b> 10, <b>H</b> 15, <b>I</b> 18, <b>L</b> 6,
<b>M</b> 6; the heel, lap, came off her shoe, <b>A</b> <b>a</b>
9, <b>b</b> 9, <b>c</b> 14, <b>C</b> 12, the corks from her heels
did flee, <b>I</b> 17; but ere she came down again she was
condemned to die, <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 9, <b>b</b> 9, <b>c</b> 14,
<b>C</b> 12, <b>D</b> 16, <b>E</b> 14, <b>H</b> 15, <b>I</b> 17;
but when she reached the gallows-foot, <b>G</b> 10, <b>I</b> 18,
<b>M</b> 6, ere she came to the Cowgate Head, <b>L</b> 6, when
she came down the Canongate, <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 8, <b>b</b> 8,
<b>c</b> 13, the tears blinded her eyes. She calls for a bottle
of wine, that she may drink to her well-wishers and they may
drink to her, <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 12, <b>b</b> 10, <b>c</b> 17,
<b>B</b> 14; cf. <b>D</b> 19, 20, <b>G</b> 13. She adjures
sailors, travellers, not to let her father and mother get wit
what death she is to die, <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 14, <b>b</b> 12,
<b>c</b> 19, <b>B</b> 15, <b>C</b> 13, <b>D</b> 20, <b>F</b> 15,
<b>G</b> 13, <b>H</b> 21, <b>I</b> 23, <b>L</b> 7, <b>M</b> 8, or
know but that she is coming home, <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 13, <b>b</b>
11, <b>B</b> 16, <b>C</b> 14, <b>D</b> 19, <b>E</b> 15, <b>F</b>
16, <b>G</b> 14, <b>H</b> 20, <b>I</b> 22, <b>L</b> 8. Little did
her mother think when she cradled her (brought her from home,
<b>F</b> 18) what lands she would travel and what end she would
come to, <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 15, <b>c</b> 21, <b>B</b> 17, 18,
<b>C</b> 15, <b>D</b> 17, <b>G</b> 15, <b>I</b> 25, <b>J</b> 9,
<b>N</b> 9, <b>B</b>; as little her father, when he held her up,
<b>A</b> <b>a</b> 16, <b>c</b> 22, <b>C</b> 16, brought her over
the sea, <b>F</b> 17. Yestreen the queen had four Maries,
to-night she'll have but three (see above); yestreen she washed
Queen Mary's feet, etc., and the gallows is her reward to-day,
<b>A</b> <b>a</b> 17, <b>b</b> 13, <b>B</b> 20, <b>C</b> 17,
<b>G</b> 11, 12, <b>H</b> 19, <b>I</b> 20, 21, <b>N</b> 8.</p>

<p>It is impossible to weave all the versions into an
intelligible and harmonious story. In <b>B</b> 10, <b>F</b> 12,
<b>H</b> 8 the intention to bring Mary to trial is avowed, and in
<b>A</b> <b>c</b> 9, <b>B</b> 8<sup>5,6</sup>, <b>F</b> 10,
<b>K</b> 5, <b>M</b> 5 she is threatened with death. In <b>D</b>
12, <b>H</b> 9, <b>J</b> 7, <b>N</b> 4, the queen is made to
favor, and not inhibit, gay colors. Mary may laugh when she goes
up the Parliament stair, but not when she goes up the Tolbooth
stair. She goes up the Canongate to the Parliament House to be
tried, but she would not go down the Canongate again, the
Tolbooth being in the High Street, an extension of the Canongate,
and the Parliament House in the rear. The tears and alaces and
ohones as Mary goes by, <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 10, <b>c</b> 15,
<b>B</b> 10, <b>C</b> 10, <b>D</b> 14, <b>E</b> 12, <b>F</b> 13,
<b>H</b> 11, <b>I</b> 16, are a sufficiently effective incident
as long as Mary is represented to be unsuspicious of her doom, as
she is in <b>D</b> 15, <b>G</b> 9, <b>I</b> 15, 16; but in
<b>A</b> <b>a</b> 11, <b>c</b> 16, <b>B</b> 11, <b>C</b> 11,
<b>H</b> 12, 22, she forbids condolement, because she deserves to
die for killing her babe, which reduces this passage to
commonplace. Much better, if properly introduced, would be the
desperate ejaculation, Seek never grace at a graceless face!
which we find in <b>E</b> 13, <b>F</b> 14, <b>H</b> 13, <b>N</b>
7.</p>

<p>At the end of <b>B</b> the king tells Mary Hamilton to come
down from the scaffold, but she scorns life after having been put
to public shame. So in <b>D</b>, with queen for king.</p>

<p>In <b>A</b> <b>a</b> 4, <b>b</b> 4, 13, <b>G</b> 5 the queen
is "the auld queen," and yet Mary Stuart.</p>

<p><b>E</b>, from 16, <b>F</b>, from 19, are borrowed from No 95,
'<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_95.html">The Maid Freed From the Gallows</a>:' see II, 346. <b>G</b> 8 (and
<b>I</b> 13, taken from <b>G</b>) is derived from '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_73.html">Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</a>,'
<b>D</b> <b>a</b> 11, <b>e</b> 10, <b>g</b> 11:
see II, 187, 196, 197. The rejection of black and brown, <b>A</b>
7, <b>C</b> 9, <b>D</b> 13, etc., or of green, <b>K</b> 6, is
found in the same ballad, <b>C</b> 10, <b>E</b> 16, <b>F</b> 12,
15, etc., <b>B</b> 20. <b>B</b> 21 is perhaps from 'The Laird of
Waristoun:' see further on, <b>A</b> 9, <b>B</b> 10, <b>C</b> 4.
<b>I</b> 12, 14 look like a souvenir of '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_64.html">Fair Janet</a>,' No 64.</p>

<p>There are not a few spurious passages. Among these are the
extravagance of the queen's bursting in the door, <b>F</b> 8; the
platitude, of menial stamp, that the child, if saved, might have
been an honor to the mother, <b>D</b> 10, <b>L</b> 3, <b>O</b> 4;
the sentimentality of <b>H</b> 3, 16.</p>

<p>Allan Cunningham has put the essential incidents of the story
into a rational order, that of <b>A</b>, for example, with less
than usual of his glistering and saccharine phraseology: Songs of
Scotland, I, 348. Aytoun's language is not quite definite with
regard to the copy which he gives at II, 45, ed. 1859: it is,
however, made up from versions previously printed.</p>

<p>When Mary Stuart was sent to France in 1548, she being then
between five and six, she had for companions "sundry gentlewomen
and noblemen's sons and daughters, almost of her own age, of the
which there were four in special of whom every one of them bore
the same name of Mary, being of four sundry honorable houses, to
wit, Fleming, Livingston, Seton, and Beaton of Creich; who
remained all four with the queen in France during her residence
there, and returned again in Scotland with her Majesty in the
year of our Lord 1561: "Lesley, History of Scotland, 1830, p.
209. We still hear of the Four Maries in 1564, Calendar of State
Papers (Foreign), VII, 213, 230; cited by Burton, IV, 107. The
ballad substitutes Mary Hamilton and Mary Carmichael for Mary
Livingston and Mary Fleming; but <b>F</b> 3, 12 has Livingston.
<b>N</b>, of late recitation, has Heaton for Seton and Michel for
Carmichael.</p>

<p><b>D</b> 4, etc. In '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_39.html">Tam Lin</a>,' No 39, Janet pulls the rose to
kill or scathe away her babe; <b>A</b> 19, 20, <b>F</b> 8,
<b>I</b> 24, 25 (probably repeated from <b>A</b>). In <b>G</b>
18, 19, the herb of 15 and the rose of 17 becomes the pile of the
gravil green, or of the gravil gray; in <b>H</b> 5, 6 Janet pulls
an unspecified flower or herb (I, 341 ff).</p>

<p>We have had in '<a href="LongerHarvest%EF%B9%96Text=ChildRef_49.html">The Twa Brothers</a>,' No 49, a passage like that
in which Mary begs sailors and travellers not to let her parents
know that she is not coming home; and other ballads, Norse,
Breton, Romaic, and Slavic, which present a similar trait, are
noted at I, 436 f, II, 14. To these may be added Passow, p. 400,
No 523; Jeannaraki, p. 116, No 118; Sakellarios, p. 98, No 31;
Puymaigre, 1865, p. 62, Bujeaud, II, 210 (Liebrecht); also
Guillon, p. 107, Nigra, No 27, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, pp. 164, 166,
and many copies of 'Le D&eacute;serteur,' and some of 'Le
Plongeur,' 'La ronde du Battoir.'</p>

<p>Scott thought that the ballad took its rise from an incident
related by Knox as occurring in "the beginning of the regiment of
Mary, Queen of Scots." "In the very time of the General
Assembly," says Knox, "there comes to public knowledge a heinous
murder committed in the court, yea, not far from the queen's own
lap; for a French woman that served in the queen's chamber had
played the whore with the queen's own apothecary. The woman
conceived and bare a child, whom, with common consent, the father
and the mother murdered. Yet were the cries of a new-born bairn
heard; search was made, the child and mother was both
deprehended, and so were both the man and the woman damned to be
hanged upon the public street of Edinburgh."<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d173_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> "It will
readily strike the reader," says Scott, "that the tale has
suffered great alterations, as handed down by tradition; the
French waiting-woman being changed into Mary Hamilton, and the
queen's apothecary<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d173_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> into Henry Darnley. Yet this is less
surprising when we recollect that one of the heaviest of the
queen's complaints against her ill-fated husband was his
infidelity, and that even with her personal attendants." This
General Assembly, however, met December 25, 1563, and since
Darnley did not come to Scotland until 1565, a tale of 1563, or
of 1563-4, leaves him unscathed.</p>

<p>Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, in his preface to A, Ballad Book,
1824, p. 18, observes: "It is singular that during the reign of
the Czar Peter, one of his empress's attendants, a Miss Hamilton,
was executed for the murder of a natural child... I cannot help
thinking that the two stories have been confused in the ballad,
for if Marie Hamilton was executed in Scotland, it is not likely
that her relations resided beyond seas; and we have no proof that
Hamilton was really the name of the woman who made a slip with
the queen's apothecary." Sharpe afterwards communicated details
of the story <a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d173_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> to Scott, who found in them "a very odd
coincidence in name, crime and catastrophe;" Minstrelsy, 1833,
III, 296, note. But Sharpe became convinced "that the Russian
tragedy must be the original" (note in Laing's edition of the
Ballad Book, 1880, p. 129); and this opinion is the only tenable
one, however surprising it may be or seem that, as late as the
eighteenth century, the popular genius, helped by nothing but a
name, should have been able so to fashion and color an episode in
the history of a distant country as to make it fit very plausibly
into the times of Mary Stuart.</p>

<p>The published accounts of the affair of the Russian Mary
Hamilton differ to much the same degree as some versions of the
Scottish ballad. The subject has fortunately been reviewed in a
recent article founded on original and authentic documents.</p>

<p>When the Hamiltons first came to Russia does not appear.
Artemon Sergheievitch Matveief, a distinguished personage,
minister and friend of the father of Peter the Great, married a
Hamilton, of a Scottish family settled at Moscow, after which the
Hamilton family ranked with the aristocracy. The name of Mary's
father, whether William or Daniel, is uncertain, but it is
considered safe to say that she was niece to Andrei Artemonovitch
Matveief, son of the Tsar Alexei's friend. Mary Hamilton was
created maid-of-honor to the Empress Catharine chiefly on account
of her beauty. Many of Catharine's attendants were foreigners;
not all were of conspicuous families, but Peter required that
they should all be remarkably handsome. Mary had enjoyed the
special favor of the Tsar, but incurred his anger by setting
afloat a report that Catharine had a habit of eating wax, which
produced pimples on her face. The empress spoke to her about this
slander; Mary denied that she was the author of it; Catharine
boxed her ears, and she acknowledged the offence. Mary Hamilton
had been having an amour with Ivan Orlof, a handsome aide-de-camp
of Tsar Peter, and while she was under the displeasure of her
master and mistress, the body of a child was found in a well,
wrapped in a court-napkin. Orlof, being sent for by Peter on
account of a missing paper, thought that his connection with Mary
had been discovered, and in his confusion let words escape him
which Peter put to use in tracing the origin of the child. The
guilt was laid at Mary's door; she at first denied the
accusation, but afterwards made a confession, exonerating Orlof,
however, from all participation in the death of the babe; and
indeed it was proved that he had not even known of its birth till
the information came to him in the way of court-gossip. Both were
sent to the Petropaulovsk fortress, Orlof on April 4, Mary on
April 10, 1718. Orlof was afterwards discharged without
punishment. Mary, after being twice subjected to torture, under
which she confessed to having previously destroyed two
children,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d173_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> was condemned to death November 27, 1718, and
executed on March 14, 1719, the Tsar attending. She had attired
herself in white silk, with black ribbons, hoping thereby to
touch Peter's heart. She fell on her knees and implored a pardon.
But a law against the murder of illegitimate children had
recently been promulgated afresh and in terms of extreme
severity. Peter turned aside and whispered something to the
executioner; those present thought he meant to show grace, but it
was an order to the headsman to do his office. The Tsar picked up
Mary's head and kissed it, made a little discourse on the anatomy
of it to the spectators, kissed it again, and threw it down. That
beautiful head is said to have been kept in spirits for some
sixty years at the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>It will be observed that this adventure at the Russian court
presents every material feature in the Scottish ballad, and even
some subordinate ones which may or may not have been derived from
report, may or may not have been the fancy-work of singers or
reciters. We have the very name, Mary Hamilton; she is a
maid-of-honor; she has, as some versions run, an intrigue with
the king, and has a child, which she destroys; she rolls the
child in a napkin and throws it into a well (rolls the child in
her handkerchief, apron, and throws it in the sea); she is
charged with the fact and denies; according to some versions,
search is made and overwhelming proof discovered;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d173_007','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> she is
tried and condemned to die; she finds no grace. The appeal to
sailors and travellers in the ballad shows that Mary Hamilton
dies in a foreign land not that of her ancestors. The king's
coming by in <b>B</b> 22 (cf. <b>D</b> 22, 23) may possibly be a
reminiscence of the Tsar's presence at the execution, and Mary's
dressing herself in white, etc., to shine through Edinburgh town
a transformation of Mary's dressing herself in white to move the
Tsar's pity at the last moment; but neither of these points need
be insisted on.</p>

<p>There is no trace of an admixture of the Russian story with
that of the French woman and the queen's apothecary, and no
ballad about the French woman is known to have existed.</p>

<p>We first hear of the Scottish ballad in 1790, when a stanza is
quoted in a letter of Robert Burns (see <b>B</b>). So far as I
know, but one date can be deduced from the subject-matter of the
ballad; the Netherbow Port is standing in <b>G</b>, <b>I</b>,
<b>M</b>, and this gate was demolished in 1764. The ballad must
therefore have arisen between 1719 and 1764. It is remarkable
that one of the very latest of the Scottish popular ballads
should be one of the very best.</p>
