<h3>155. Sir Hugh,<br/>
or,<br/>
The Jew's Daughter</h3>

<p>The twenty-one versions of this ballad (so far as they are not
mere fragments) agree in the outline of the story and in many of
the details. In <b>N</b>, a singular copy obtained in New York,
the boy's name is corrupted to Harry Hughes, and the Jew's
daughter becomes the Duke's daughter.</p>

<p>The story of Hugh of Lincoln is told in the Annals of
Waverley, under the year 1255, by a contemporary writer, to this
effect. A boy in Lincoln, named Hugh, was crucified by the Jews
in contempt of Christ with various preliminary tortures. To
conceal the act from Christians, the body, when taken from the
cross, was thrown into a rnnning stream; but the water would not
endure the wrong done its maker, and immediately ejected it upon
dry land. The body was then buried in the earth, but was found
above ground the next day. The guilty parties_ were now very much
frightened and quite at their wits' end; a~ a last resort they
threw the corpse into a well. Thereupon the whole place was
fillpd with so brilliant a light and so sweet an odor that it was
clear to everybody that there must be something holy and
prodigious in the well. The body was seen floating on the water,
and, upon its being drawn up, the hands and feet were found to he
pierced, the }lead had, as it were, a crown of bloody points, and
there were various other wounds: from all which it was plain that
this was the work of the Jews. A blind woman, tonching the bier
on which the blessed martyr's corpse was carrying to the church,
received her sight, and many other miracles followed. Eighteen
Jews, convicted of the crime, and confessing it with their own
mouth, were hanged. Matthew Paris, also writing
contemporaneously, supplies additional circumstances, one of
which, the mother's finding of the child, is prominent in the
ballad. The Annals of Burton give a long report of this case,
which is perhaps contemporary, though the manuscript is mostly of
the next century.</p>

<p>An Anglo-French ballad, which also appears to be contemporary
with the event, agrees in mauy particulars with t.he account
given in the Annals of Burton and adds new details.</p>

<p>The English ballads, the oldest of which were recovered abont
t.he middle of the eighteenth century, must, in the course of
five hundred years of tradition, have depart.ed considerably from
the early form. The occurrence of Our Lady's draw-well, in
<b>A</b>, is due to a mixing, to this extent, of the story of
Hugh with that of the young devotee of the Virgin who is
celebrated in Chaucer's Prioresses Tale.</p>

<p>Murders like that of Hugh of Lincoln have been imputed to t.he
Jews for at least seven hundred and fifty years, and the charge,
which there is reason to suppose may still from time to time be
renewed, bas brought upon t.he accused every calamity that the
hand of man can inflict, pillage, confiscation, banishment,
torture, and death, and this in huge proportions. The process of
these murders has often been described as a parody of the
crucifixion of Jesus. The motive most commollly alleged, in
addition to the contempt for Christianity, has been the obtaining
of blood for use in the Paschal rites, a most unhappily devised
slander, in stark contradiction with Jewish precept and practice.
That no Christian child was ever killed by a Jew, that there
never even was so much truth as that (setting aside the object)
in a single case of these particular criminations, is what no
Christ.ian or Jew would undertake to assert; but of these charges
in the masg it may safely be said, as it has been said, that they
are as credible as the miracles which, in a great nnmber of
cases, are asserted to have been worked by the reliques of the
young saints, and as well substantiated as the absurd sacrilege
of stabbing, baking, or boiling t.he Host, or the enormity of
poisoning springs, with which the Jews have equally been taxed.
And these pretended child-murders, with their horrible
consequencps, are only a part of a persecntion which, with all
moderation, may be rubricated as the most disgraceful chapter in
the history of the human race.</p>

<p>Several cases of such murders in England are reported from the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The oldest is that of William
of Norwich, 1144, given in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle nnder u:n
(ed. Plummer, <b>I</b>, 2(5). See The Life and Miracles of Saint
William, edited by Jessopp and James, 1807.</p>
