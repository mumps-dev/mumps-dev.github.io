<p>The copy in Scott's Minstrelsy, 1802, I, 154, 1833, II, 76, is
<b>B</b> <b>b</b>, with the insertion of three stanzas (6, 7, 23)
from <b>B</b> <b>a</b>. Neither Campbell nor Scott has the last
stanza of <b>B</b> <b>a</b>. Campbell says, in a note to his
copy: The melody and particularly the words of this Liddesdale
song were taken down by the editor from the singing and
recitation of Mr. Thomas Shortreed, who learnt it from his
father. As to the words (except in the omission of four stanzas),
<b>b</b> does not differ significantly from <b>a</b>, and it may,
with little hesitation, be said to have been derived from a.
Campbell seems to have given this copy to Scott, who published it
sixteen years before it appeared in the Anthology, with the
addition already mentioned.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d187_001','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> The copy in the Campbell
Manuscripts, I, 220, is <b>B</b> <b>a</b>.</p>

<p>The earliest appearance of John o the Side is, perhaps, in the
list of the marauders against whom complaint was made to the
Bishop of Carlisle "presently after" Queen Mary Stuart's
departure for France; not far, therefore, from 1550: "John of the
Side (Gleed John)."</p>

<p>Mr. R.B. Armstrong has printed two bonds in which John
Armstrong of the Syde is a party, with others, of the date 1562
and 1563. History of Liddesdale, etc., Appendix, pp ciii, civ,
Nos LXV, LXVI.</p>

<p>The earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, after the
failure of the Rising in the North, fled first to Liddesdale, and
thence "to one of the Armstrongs," in the Debateable Land. The
Liddesdale men stole the Countess of Northumberland's horses, and
the earls, continuing their flight, left her "on foot, at John of
the Syde's house, a cottage not to be compared to any dog-kennel
in England." At his departing, "my lord of Westmoreland changed
his coat of plate and sword with John of the Syde, to be the more
unknown:" Sussex to Cecil, December 22, 1569, printed in Sharp's
Memorials of the Rebellion, p. 114 f.</p>

<p>John is nephew to the laird of Mangerton in <b>B</b> 1, 3, 4,
<b>C</b> 1, 3, and therefore cousin to the Laird's Jock and the
Laird's Wat:<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d187_002','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> but this does not appear in <b>A</b>.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Maitland commemorates both John of the Syde and
the Laird's Jock in his verses on the thieves of Liddesdale:</p>

<tr><td colspan="2" align="right">(Manuscript, fol. 4, back, line 13.)</td></tr>

</table>

<p>An Archie Armstrang in Syde is complained of, with others, in
1596, for burning eleven houses (Register of the Privy Council of
Scotland, V, 294), and Christie of the Syde is "mentioned in the
list of border clans, 1597" (Scott).</p>

<p>In Blaeu's map of Liddesdale, "Syid" is on the right bank of
the Liddel, nearly opposite Mangerton, but a little higher up the
stream.</p>

<p><b>A</b>. John a Side has been taken in a raid<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d187_003','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> and
carried prisoner to Newcastle. Sybill o the Side (his mother, 20)
runs by the water with the news to Mangerton, where lords and
ladies are ready to sell all their cattle and sheep for John's
ransom. But Hobby Noble says that with five men he would fetch
John back. The laird offers five thousand, but Hobby will take
only five. They will not go like men of war, but like poor
corn-dealers, and their steeds must be barefoot. When they come
to Chollerton, on the Tyne, the water is up. Hobby asks an old
man the way over the ford. The old man in three-score years and
three has never seen horse go over except a horse of tree;
meaning, we may suppose, a foot-bridge. In spite of the old man
they find a way where they can cross in pairs. In Howbram wood
they cut a tree of three-and-thirty foot, and with help of this,
or without it, they climb to the top of the castle, where John is
making his farewells to his mother, the lord of Mangerton, Much
the Miller's son, and "Lord Clough." Hobby Noble calls to John to
say that he has come to loose him;<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d187_004','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> John fears that it will not
be done. Two men keep the horses, and four break the outer door
(John himself breaking five doors within) and come to the iron
door. The bell strikes twelve. Much the Miller fears they will be
taken, and even John despairs of success. Hobby is not daunted;
he files down the iron door and takes John out. John in his bolts
can neither sit nor stride; Hobby ties the chains to John's feet,
and says John rides like a bride. As they go through Howbram town
John's horse stumbles, and Much is again in a panic, which seems
to show that John's commendation of him in 22 applies rather to
his capacity as a thief than to his mettle. In Howbram wood they
file off John's bolts at the feet. Now, says Hobby, leap over a
horse! and John leaps over five. They have no difficulty in
fording the Tyne on their return, and bring John home to
Mangerton without further trouble.</p>

<p>It is Hobby Noble, then, that looses John in A, as he is said
to have done in his own ballad, st. 27; but in <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>
the Laird's Jock takes the lead, and Hobie plays a subordinate
part. The Laird's Wat replaces the faint-hearted Much (who,
however, is again found in the fragment <b>D</b>); Sybil of the
Side becomes Downie (in <b>D</b> Dinah); the liberating party is
but three instead of six.</p>

<p>The laird in <b>B</b> orders the horses to be shod the wrong
way,<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d187_005','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> whereas in <b>A</b> the shoes were taken off; and the
party must not seem to be gentlemen, Heaven save the mark! but
look like corn-cadgers, as in <b>A</b>. At Cholerford they cut a
tree with fifteen nags, <b>B</b> 11, <b>C</b> with fifty nags, on
each side, <b>D</b> twenty snags, and three long ones on the top;
but when they come to Newcastle it proves to be too short, as the
ladders are in the historical account of the release of Kinmont
Willie. The Laird's Jock says they must force the gate. A proud
porter withstands them; they wring his neck, and take his keys,
<b>B</b> 13, 14, <b>C</b> 10 (cf. No 116, st. 65, No 119, 70, 71,
and III, 95 note &#8224;). When they come to the jail, they let
Jock know that they mean to free him; he is hopeless; the day is
come he is to die; fifteen stone of iron (fifty, <b>C</b>) is
laid on him. Work thou within and we without, says the Laird's
Jock. One door they open and one they break. The Laird's Jock
gets John o the Side on his back and takes him down the stair,
declining help from Hobie. They put the prisoner on a horse, with
the same jest as before; the night is wet, as it was when Kinmont
Willie was loosed, but they hie on merrily. They had no trouble
in crossing the Tyne when they were coming, but now it is running
like a sea. The old man had never seen it so big; the Laird Wat
says they are all dead men. Set the prisoner on behind me, cries
the gallant Laird's Jock, and they all swim through. Hardly have
they won the other side when twenty Englishmen who are pursuing
them reach the river. The land-sergeant says that the water will
not ride, and calls to them to throw him the irons; they may have
the rogue. The Laird's Jock answers that he will keep the irons
to shoe his grey mare.<a href="../index.html" onclick="window.open('LongerHarvest?Text=PopUp_d187_006','FootNote','width=550,height=250,scrollbars=yes'); return false;" title="Click to view foot-note."><font color="red"><sup>[foot-note]</sup></font></a> They bring John to Liddesdale, and there
they free him of his irons, <b>B</b>. Now, John, they say, 'the
day was come thou wast to die;' but thou'rt as well at thy own
fireside.</p>

<p>In <b>D</b> 5 they cut their mares' tails before starting, and
never stop running till they come to Hathery Haugh. Tyne is
running like a sea when they come to Chollerton, on their way to
the rescue, as in <b>A</b>. They cut their tree in Swinburn wood.
When they are to re-cross the river, Much says his mare is young
and will not swim; the Laird's Jock (?) says, Take thou mine, and
I'll take thine.</p>

<p>The ballad is one of the best in the world, and enough to make
a horse-trooper of any young borderer, had he lacked the impulse.
In deference to history, it is put after Kinmont Willie, for it
may be a free version of his story.</p>
